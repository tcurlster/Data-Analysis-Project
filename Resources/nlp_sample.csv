0,HOME & LIVING,Master Spring Cleaning With These Surprising Tips,"Laura McHolm, Contributor
NorthStar Moving Company Co-Founder",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/spring-cleaning-tips_us_5b9d0047e4b03a1dcc83a635,Do you have a home story idea or tip? Email us at homesubmissions@huffingtonpost.com. (PR pitches sent to this address will,2013-04-03,ARTS & CULTURE,"So, it's that time of year again when we get down on our hands and knees and scrub our home top to bottom. Okay, well, it's the time of year you promised yourself you would do THE BIG CLEAN. Sponge? Check. Eco-friendly cleaning solutions? Check. Rubber gloves? Check. Ready, set, clean. What? You still haven't started? Or, you've pushed the task off to summer break? Come on now, here are two tips to get you spring cleaning:
  Have a spring mantra. How about ""Less is More."" Sure, you have heard that mantra before but have you really applied it? Visualize having to move. Do you really want to move all this stuff into your new place? If you don't, then it's time to put on your imaginary Mother Theresa habit and start giving your unwanted stuff to your favorite charity. Moving is the time in our lives when we get rid of the most stuff, so why not just pretend you're moving and make your spring clean a meaningful experience. What? You're still not cleaning? Okay, so you aren't motivated by doing good for the needy? Maybe, you need a little negative reinforcement for your lack of action? How's this: Set a date the spring cleaning has to be complete. If it's not done by that date you have to donate a $100 to your least favorite organization: you know the one. 
Okay, now we've got you cleaning! Here are 10 ideas to make the most of your cleaning frenzy and have you love the final result:
In the spring, it's time to put heavy fabrics, throw blankets and extra toss pillows in storage or if you are never going to use them again donate them to your favorite charity. Less things and textures will make you feel cool and clean. Clear clutter. If things like papers and magazines have been piling up, decide if you really need them. If so, this might be a good time to pack them away. If not, recycle them or donate to your local library. Out with the Poinsettias. Go to a local farmer's market and pick out spring plants to have in the house. Fresh plants help improve the flow of oxygen in your home, bringing in that clean spring-like air. Who doesn't love an orchid or a tulip plant? Closet purge. Pick one closet per weekend, and empty everything out of the closet onto the floor. I mean everything! Create four piles: ""keep,"" ""give away,"" ""throw away,"" and ""store."" If you can't remember the last time you used something, get rid of it! Think about the reuse your worn clothing will get from those who need it. Consider the benefits of digital photos: take pictures of nostalgic items you toss, and file images of items you store so you know exactly what is in each box. Seasonal turnover. Assess winter shoes, coats and purses. Will they make it another season? If so, put them in storage. If they won't make it another season donate them, they'll keep someone else cozy next year. And, no shopping for new spring clothes, that is until you make room. Get rid of an old item for every new item. 
If you have items to store think green when selecting a storage unit. Be sure to seek full-service moving and storage companies that use boxes made of 100% recyclable materials and use warehouse-style facilities that store items in reusable wooden vaults - greener for you, greener for the environment. The kids' rooms. Purchase bed raisers for under-the-bed storage. You can store everything from shoes, laundry basket, books and any bulky items that might otherwise clutter their room. Get the kids involved in taking some items to the Goodwill or the charity of your choice. Are you kids lucky enough not to know what the under privileged look like? Time for a ""drive by"" of a neighborhood they haven't frequented. My parents took me on a little drive like that when I announced at the dinner table that so and so was poor because she rode her sister's bike. My mother was horrified that I had no concept of what ""poor"" really meant. You get rid of food when moving so why not do it now? Sort through kitchen cabinets and box up canned foods that you have not used in three months. Donate them to Move for Hunger or your local food bank. One in four children in Los Angeles go to bed hungry. Are kids going to bed hungry where you live? Once you have sorted everything, throw a reverse housewarming party! When your friends say ""housewarming?"" tell your friends ""I am not moving, but my stuff is."" You will be starting a new party trend. Set aside your unwanted items and instead of having your friends bring a housewarming gift, they are to pick one of your items and take it home with them. This is a great way to reunite with friends, find your unwanted things a good home, and de-clutter all at the same time!  Last but not least, step back and take a pictures of your ""new"" home and place them on the inside of a drawer to refer to, so you can keep it that way! Really, do it. You won't have to revisit organizing for a long time! 
Come on, you'll love your new clean space and yourself for it!

1,FOOD & DRINK,Labor Day Grilling: Szechuan Pork Chops,"Anne Maxfield, Contributor
Founder",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/labor-day-grilling-szechu_us_5b9d7f28e4b03a1dcc88c447,"Because it's probably unconstitutional not to grill on Labor Day, the Accidental Locavore decided to do the patriotic bit",2013-09-09,ARTS & CULTURE,"Because it's probably unconstitutional not to grill on Labor Day, the Accidental Locavore decided to do the patriotic bit and grill some pork chops over the weekend. Looking for something different to marinate them in, I went back to Jeff Parker's great grilling site and found this recipe he used to make Szechuan pulled pork. It makes a little too much marinade for a couple of chops, but hey... • 1 large clove garlic, run through a garlic press • 1/4 cup soy sauce • 1/4 cup rice vinegar • 2 tablespoons peanut oil • 1 tablespoon Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry • 1 tablespoon brown sugar • 1 tablespoon Szechuan peppercorns, toasted and ground • 2 bone-in pork chops (about ¾ pound each) Mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl. Put the pork chops in a Ziploc bag, add the marinade, seal and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Remove the chops from the refrigerator an hour before you want to cook them and allow to come to room temperature. Grill over medium-high heat for about 4 minutes a side, depending on the thickness of your chops. Serve and enjoy! My verdict: It doesn't get much easier than this marinade! Jeff's got a sauce for his pulled pork that sounds great, but these chops were just delicious (perfectly grilled by my husband) with just the marinade! Toasting and grinding the Szechuan peppercorns add a nice depth of flavor to them and only takes about a minute. You pop them in a small frying pan over medium-high heat for a minute until they just start to smell fragrant. You can do them in the microwave on a plate for a minute or two, but since it can be a slim margin between toasted and toast, I like the control I have with a frying pan. I deviated from Jeff's recipe and added garlic-a little fresh ginger, grated, might go in the next time. Don't think you can substitute regular peppercorns for the Szechuan ones, not even close!

2,ARTS,Return of the Artisan?,"Phil Simon, ContributorSpeaker, author, professor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/return-of-the-artisan_b_6049790.html,"The digital revolution in music has always faced outspoken critics. Some have complained about harsh digital sound. Many lament illegal downloads. These days, musicians protest paltry revenue from streaming sites like Pandora.",2014-10-26,ARTS & CULTURE,"The digital revolution in music has always faced outspoken critics. Some have complained about harsh digital sound. Many lament illegal downloads. These days, musicians protest paltry revenue from streaming sites like Pandora.
Fortunately for dedicated listeners, some of these critics are also famous artists who seek to deliver a more engaging experience. Count Steven Wilson among them. Yes, we live in an age of overwhelming quantity, but sound quality often suffers. Examples include HBO's new mini-series Sonic Highways. It follows Foo Fighters as they make a new album in America's most revered recording studios. The ""Ultra LP"" version of Jack White's new album Lazaretto rethinks the way that music is pressed on vinyl.
You may have heard of these folks, but what about lesser-known artists? I'm talking about those who can't afford camera crews, large studios, and vinyl pressings? Is there a way for them to provide their audience with the same experience?
John Roccesano, known to friends as Johnny Rock, is a 32-year-old drummer and project studio owner in northern New Jersey. His new album, Johnny Rock & Friends: For The Record, takes an ensemble cast of unsigned talent and gets them into the grooves of a full-length LP. Roccesano recorded and mixed the album over two years on analog tape, and the entire process is documented in a series of in-depth YouTube videos.
I sat down with him recently to talk about the process. 
PS: When and why did you launch For The Record?
JR: In 2012 I was getting really into playing vinyl records and researching everything I could about them. I've been on Steve Hoffman's Music Forum for years, which gave me a fantastic primer on vinyl, and also influenced me to buy different versions of the same albums for comparison. My friend and now co-producer Jonathan Bross and I would compare analog and digital recordings at his studio with critical ears (analog always sounded better). That's the kind of audience I had in mind when we started - people who care just as much about sound quality as they care about the music.
I learned that an all-analog album is actually very rare to produce. Very few mastering studios in the world today can cut a lacquer without first converting the source tape to digital. My friends are fantastic local musicians, and I knew most had never been recorded on 2-inch tape, let alone had their music pressed on vinyl. So I conceived a new album that could provide the analog experience to my friends, and together we could all make it onto a vinyl record.
What are you doing to drum up interest?
JR: We've just launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the manufacturing process and take pre-orders. More than that, last year I launched a YouTube channel that gives viewers an immersive experience. My two main features have been Artist Spotlights, where I interview most of our main cast about their musical journeys and how we all connect. Then there are videos which explore each song's conception and all the stages it went through in the studio. I've recorded over 60 hours of footage, so these videos will continue even after the record arrives in 2015.
PS: Unlike most compilation albums, yours is not a promotional record. It's an artistic one. Do you think it can find an audience without an accompanying live act?
JR: Well it's really not a ""compilation"" album, it's actually a ""collaboration"" album. The submissions were admittedly unrelated, but they were then arranged, recorded, and sequenced to be cohesive. As for a live adaptation, a live public concert is entirely feasible with a small group of us. But it would certainly be limited, and that's why I'm making such an expansive online universe that includes all of us. I think as long as we can keep our respective fan bases engaged and as long as they like the music, we can reach more people. By the way, we are offering private concerts in one of our Kickstarter rewards.
PS: What were the challenges you faced with analog recording?
The artists had to be present in a recording studio, lest a tape machine end up in their home. The limitations of the medium force you to think differently as well. There's a song on the record I co-wrote with my cousin Meagan, who lives over a thousand miles away in south Florida. I booked a recording studio there in March and flew down, but when my plane landed I had a voicemail from the studio saying their tape machine was broken. Everywhere else I looked didn't get back to me in time or was too expensive. But rather than cop-out and use a digital rig, we just scheduled another trip. So I went back in August with a cassette machine and we recorded in her dad's living room. People told me I was crazy for not doing that digitally, or that doing it on cassette was senseless. But I didn't care - I wanted a live performance caught on tape, and we did it.
PS: Do you think that digital recording and distribution is a blessing or a curse?
JR: Digital recording (on computers, not digital tape) is absolutely a blessing. It's much more versatile, practical, affordable, and portable. I find it lacking that extra bigness that tape adds, but it's still really good. Some people misuse or overuse the options available in digital recording, but others make it sound beautiful, so I'll take the bad with the good. Digital delivery on the other hand is awfully paradoxical. It seems miraculous to have so much content just a click away, but the quality is usually bad, if not terrible. We have immediate access to a worldwide audience, but get lost in a bombardment of information.
I co-wrote a song on the record called ""Window To The World"" about the paradox of technological advancements. I half-sarcastically sing ""We can buy and sell the tangible things / We can buy and sell our dreams / Or we can steal it all with style and with ease / We're really ghosts in the machine."" We've come a ways since the days of Napster, but the bottom line is most music ends up somewhere for free now; it's a given. And now that everything's free, nothing seems special.
PS: And yet vinyl record sales have increased every year since 2007. Why do you suppose that is?
I'd like to think it's because people had the same experience I did. I had some records laying around for years and I finally decided to get a turntable and play them. The experience was really great, and so I bought more records, old and new. Records sonically and visually have an allure about them, as does analog recording. The sales increases don't surprise me.
PS: What's been the greatest thrill of this experience?
It hasn't happened yet I'm sure. The greatest thrill will be watching a record spin on my turntable that my friends and I made. Now was the right time to do it, because it is prohibitively expensive for most working class musicians. And this technology won't be here forever; the machines in use are almost all from the 20th century. I call this project ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,"" because at the rate the old studios and true craftsmen are closing shop, it is.

3,HOME & LIVING,Honey Boo Boo's Mother June Shannon Gives A Tour Of The Family's Georgia Home (VIDEO),Amy Marturana,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/honey-boo-boo-house-tour_us_5b9cab99e4b03a1dcc80bbf7,"Her ""stockpile"" room is quite, um, impressive.",2012-12-28,ARTS & CULTURE,"It's safe to say that one of the biggest pop culture phenomenons of 2012 was ""Here Comes Honey Boo Boo."" The TLC reality show (a spinoff of the also popular yet horrifying ""Toddlers & Tiaras""), follows the life of child beauty pageant contestant Alana Thompson (Honey Boo Boo) and her family in rural McIntyre, Georgia. And immediately after its initial air date this past August, it became one of the most talked about television programs.
So what better way to close out the year and prepare for the show's return in January than by taking a house tour of the family's humble abode? Alana's mother, June, takes us through the home for a quick tour and inside peek at their daily life.
The tour begins in the family room, where you can find an entertainment center adorned with pageant tiaras. And the shelf right beside it is lined with trophies and sashes. The storage room, or what June, a serious ""couponer,"" refers to as the ""stockpile room,"" is devoid of any pageant paraphernalia. Instead, the wall-to-wall shelves are filled with a three year's supply of toilet paper, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant and other toiletry items. There's also plenty of barbecue and hot sauce -- which she explained are both staples in the family's diet.
June also takes us through the girls' rooms, the kitchen (where she stops to snack on some cheese and honey) and the master bedroom, where all of the girls gather to get ready in the morning like the pageant queens they are.
In the video above, you'll get a taste of how the family lives and what Honey Boo Boo is all about. If you've ever seen the show, you know what to expect from the Thompson-Shannon clan. If you haven't, you'll quickly be horrified, intrigued and totally enamored by the family's completely outrageous ways, all at the same time.

4,ARTS,How One Woman Is Turning Her Online Harassment Into Art,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-davis-roth_n_5813070.html,,2014-09-13,ARTS & CULTURE,"This post originally appeared on Slate. 
By Phil Plait

My good friend, Amy Davis Roth, is awesome.
Or, more properly, awe-inspiring. On her own she is quite a person: A dedicated artist who produces cool jewelry, who creates wonderful paintings, who is an outspoken supporter of critical thinking and science, and who is also an intelligent, thoughtful, and vocal feminist.
She does all this—and much more—every single day while slogging through an unbelievable miasma of misogyny.
And I do mean unbelievable. For having the temerity to say that women should have equal rights, opportunities, and treatment as men, she gets a tsunami of hatred, venom, death threats, rape threats, and more. It would be enough to break down hardened people, and it has. But not Amy. She manages to not only deal with this horrifying onslaught but also turn it into art.
I mean that literally. With the help of several other atheist and skeptical women, Amy has created an exhibit called A Woman’s Room Online: a free-standing 8x10 foot room that is being installed in the L.A. Center for Inquiry office. It will look superficially much like any office in which a woman might work, with the usual accoutrements.
But each object will be covered with messages these women have received on Twitter, Facebook, and email. Real messages, actual things sent to them that are the vilest, most hateful examples of the worst humanity has to offer.
Amy Roth and Phil Plait What happens when you treat people with respect: They like you. Photo by Amy Davis Roth
I recently visited Amy and stayed with her for a few days. She showed some of the individual pieces to my wife and me, and they are as powerful as the words plastered on them are repellent.
The words are hard to read, so difficult to imagine an actual human sending them to another human. They run the range from self-satisfied and arrogant to graphic and explicit threats against body and life. Sexism and misogyny had been brewing in the atheist and skeptical movements for some time but exploded when Rebecca Watson brought attention to them, and people were further polarized after Richard Dawkins made his “Muslima” comments in response. That was years ago, and things are no better ... as we've also seen in so many other online communities as well.
Perhaps sunlight is the best disinfectant, and art has a way of focusing that light. Over at Skepchick, Amy herself wrote a description of her installation, and I strongly encourage you to read it.
I think this is an important piece of art. I suspect a lot of people really don’t have any idea just how much filth women (not only feminists, but just women on the Internet guilty of Posting While Female) have to slog through every day just to exist online. It’s horrifying—and sadly, used as a way to shut women up; read Amanda Marcotte's recent post about this.
A Woman’s Room Online will hopefully open a lot of eyes. And minds. And, hopefully, hearts.
The exhibit opens this weekend, running from Sept. 13–Oct. 13 daily. For more information, contact the L.A. Women’s Atheist and Agnostic Group (a group Amy founded, and they're accepting donations through there as well).

5,CULTURE & ARTS,"Meet Julia Margaret Cameron, The Victorian Queen Of Contemporary Photography",Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/julia-margaret-cameron_us_5bb2652ee4b0171db69fd04f,"Philip Stanhope Worsley Alfred Lord Tennyson Cameron was 48 years old when she obtained her first camera, given to her as",2013-09-02,ARTS & CULTURE,"Jonathon Keats called her the ""Godmother Of Instagram,"" Walter Robinson dubbed her the ""Cindy Sherman of the Victorian Era."" Yes, the 19th century British photographer sure had a knack for contemporary photography trends.
 Pomona
Cameron was 48 years old when she obtained her first camera, given to her as a gift by her daughter and son-in-law. ""From the first moment I handled my lens with a tender ardour,"" she wrote upon receiving it, ""and it has become to me as a living thing, with voice and memory and creative vigour."" Cameron was religious, well-read and a bit eccentric, having friends in the Victorian poetry and science circles like Alfred Lord Tennyson and Sir John Herschel. These accomplished compatriots soon became Cameron's favorite subjects. 
 King Lear Alotting His Kingdom to His Three Daughters 
""I began with no knowledge of the art,"" Cameron wrote. ""I did not know where to place my dark box, how to focus my sitter, and my first picture I effaced to my consternation by rubbing my hand over the filmy side of the glass.""
Unfortunately, art critics at the time were not too fond of Cameron's portraits. ""In these pictures all that is good about photography has been neglected, and the shortcomings of the art are prominently exhibited,"" The Photographic Journal printed in 1864. ""We are sorry to have to speak thus severely on the works of a lady, but we feel compelled to do so in the interest of the art."" 
 Sappho
Cameron reveled in the failures of her instruments, preferring to harness the spirit of her subject rather than a direct copy of their image. Her feathery, Pre-Raphaelite photographs float away from reality in their breathy visual interpretations. ""Time does not freeze in such a photograph. It melts and steams,"" Anthony Lane wrote in The New Yorker.
Today we see this love of photography's flaws everywhere, particularly in photography filters like Hipstamatic and Instagram that distort exact digital replications. These contemporary techniques reveal a similar privileging of mood and essence over mimetic imagery.
 A Study 
As Robinson points out, Cameron predates post-modern photo goddess Cindy Sherman in her realization of the theatrics of the medium. In her photographs, Cameron acted out scenes from mythology, the Bible and Shakespeare, even creating an entire series based off Tennyson's poetry. Yet Cameron diverges from Sherman in tone, lacking any sort of irony or critique in her visions.
Somewhere between the styles of F. Holland Day and Francesca Woodman, Cameron's soft-edged, spiritual portraits show that images can look ephemeral while proving immortal.

7,ARTS,"A Love Letter To Louise Bourgeois, A Feminist Icon Whether She Likes It Or Not",Katherine Brooks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/louise-bourgeois_n_5600404.html,,2014-07-19,ARTS & CULTURE,"Louis Bourgeois is a feminist art icon, even if she -- in some mythical afterlife populated by giant spiders and contorted, alien figures -- would hate the label. When she was alive, she was aloof on the subject. ""Some of my works are, or try to be feminist, and others are not feminist,"" she proclaimed in an interview with the San Francisco Museum of Art. 
""I am lucky to have been brought up by a mother who was a feminist and fortunate enough to have married a husband who was a feminist, and I have raised sons who are feminists,"" Germaine Greer quoted her as saying in The Guardian, not long after Bourgeois' death in 2010. The artist, famous for her mammoth sculptures of spiders, pointedly leaves herself out of the list, insinuating not a rejection of the -ism, necessarily, but perhaps a bit of condescension toward critics eager to associate her with the term, no matter her opinions.
 Louise Bourgeois, Spider, 2003. Collection The Easton Foundation. Photo: Christopher Burke.
Bourgeois does owe a lot to the feminist movement. Born in Paris in 1911, she spent many of her early years known merely as the wife of Robert Goldwater, the American art historian with whom she moved to New York in the late 1930s. Though she drew, painted, sculpted and printed throughout the 1940s and '50s, Bourgeois didn't receive real art world attention until her 50s. She had to wait more than a few years before she moved from the periphery of art critics' minds to somewhere closer to the center. During that time, the feminist movement was blooming.
""The specific agent of change was feminism, the most pervasive and radical of the many 'pluralist' constituencies of the last ten years,"" Robert Storr wrote in Art in America back in 1983, around eight years after she graced the cover of Artforum and one year after her retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. ""And more particularly the insistence of feminist artists and critics we look hard at for whatever was formerly considered 'marginal' in art, and hardest of all at the very notion that a 'mainstream' existed.""
For a woman who loathed the term ""woman artist,"" it seems to many so important that she was a woman artist at the time she rose to recognition. Amidst the hyper masculine aesthetic of the Abstract Expressionists and the coy fraternity of Surrealism, she quite literally forged ahead, casting ""anti-form"" creatures from marble and bronze. From her ""Femme Maison (Woman House)"" paintings created circa 1946-47, in which the bodies of nude women are forcefully squished into the confining spaces of a home, to her 1968 sculpture, ""Janus Fleuri,"" a piece curiously sexualized if not for its inclusion of imagery that resembles both male and female genitalia, themes of femininity and gender roles reared their heads.
 Louise Bourgeois, Lady in Waiting, 2003. Collection The Easton Foundation. Photo: Christopher Burke.
A fascination with the body is apparent throughout her career. While men like Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman were swimming in color fields, she rendered her self-portrait as a torso, pieced together with bizarre bulges and crevices that seem endlessly out of place. ""That, she said, was how she felt about her physical self,"" Michael McNay wrote, ""and by extension, how women generally felt, even while they studied copies of Vogue or Harper's Bazaar.""
The list could go on: There's the 1968 piece, ""Fillette,"" which was obviously a massive penis sculpture, one that happened to make its way into a photograph by Robert Mapplethorpe. There's the 1974 tableau, ""The Destruction of the Father,"" a gathering of mammary-like objects and penile knobs said to represent the ""sacrificial evisceration of a body,"" more specifically ""a pompous father, whose presence deadens the dinner hour night after night."" There's the 1984 ""Nature Study,"" appearing like a headless sphinx covered in breasts and equipped with Doberman Pinscher-esque claws. 
 Louise Bourgeois, Untitled, 2000. Private Collection, Courtesy Hauser & Wirth. Photo: Christopher Burke.
She might not have been singing the song of feminist sirens, but her work relentlessly juxtaposed male and female forms, revealing hybrid bodies and aggressive amalgamations of phallic and yonic imagery; sexual subject matter from a woman's gaze. 
Her vocalized stance on a woman's social position versus that of a man's was at times confusing. She seemed simultaneously angry at the idea that masculinity and its own brand of ego were wrapped up in a penis, and disappointed that feminine beauty often went hand-in-hand with passivity. 
""It's a dialogue between a man and a woman,"" Bourgeois recounted in another interview with SFMOMA, cryptically titled ""Louis Bourgeois on Gender Roles."" She outlines an interesting, if not depressing scenario attached to a phantom piece of art, a retelling that's almost incomprehensible as a total story, but a strange exchange nonetheless that gives glimpses of her own sentiments toward men and women.
 Louise Bourgeois, Untitled, 2002. Collection The Easton Foundation. Photo: Christopher Burke.
""You know what men are like,"" she says to an unidentified male companion. ""For example, it's about a man who discovers a vaccine. He discovers a vaccine, he's a bigwig. As for her, she stumbles upon a little sofa at the auction rooms. Understand? That's the relationship. If that doesn't convince you, I can give you other examples. For example, when he speaks. Of course, when he speaks the world stops in its tracks. Whereas she, she just chitchats. And when it's time for dinner, he's the chef. He prepares this wonderful meal! Whereas she, she just cooks. Just cooks. And he feels good, he whistles. He whistles like a blackbird. Whereas she whistles to herself. And when he feels good he touches you, right? He touches you. Whereas she, she brushes against you. To no effect... like pissing in the wind.""
It wasn't until the 1990s that she went the way of the spider. Sculpting for heights of 35 feet, she created her first arachnid in 1999 and they quickly proliferated, as spiders are wont to do. Titled ""Maman,"" the spindly creatures and their egg sacs, made from stainless steal, marble and bronze, stood as tributes to Bourgeois' mother, Josephine. ""The Spider is an ode to my mother. She was my best friend. Like a spider, my mother was a weaver... spiders are helpful and protective, just like my mother.""
 Louise Bourgeois, Untitled, 2001. Collection The Easton Foundation. Photo: Christopher Burke.
Dark, ominous, and absent of the smooth curves of femininity, ""Maman"" projected a very different female object in places like Bilbao, Tokyo and Ottawa. Frightening yet maternal, sinister yet life-giving, antagonistic yet martyred -- these contradictions seemed Bourgeois' way of breaking through the gender binary, up until her last days at the age of 98. ""I have fantastic pleasure in breaking everything,"" she once said. Yet towards the end of her life, she created, with delicacy, particularly in the realm of tapestry. This was yet another way of honoring her mother, and achieved a sense of ""reparation.""
 Louise Bourgeois, Spider, 2007. Collection The Easton Foundation. Photo: Frédéric Delpech.
Her defiance, her arguably unmatched persistence, her visual tenacity -- these qualities will forever cement Bourgeois' place in feminist art history. Not because she's a woman artist -- a label hardly derogatory -- but because she pushed the boundaries of what it meant to make art. 
“Feminist art is not some tiny creek running off the great river of real art,"" as Andrea Dworkin declared. ""It is not some crack in an otherwise flawless stone. It is, quite spectacularly I think, art which is not based on the subjugation of one half of the species."" Bourgeois should be proud to count herself amongst those who made feminist art.

8,CULTURE & ARTS,The 12 Most Talented And Tiny Child Prodigies Of 2013,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/child-prodigies-2013_us_5bb268dfe4b0171db6a047cc,"6. Umi Garrett, 13 years old NC Child Prodigy Suffers from Debilitating Disease Nigerian photographer Onafujiri ""Fuji"" Remet",2013-12-22,ARTS & CULTURE,"As this tumultuous year comes to a close, we'd like to take a moment to look back on 2013's most precocious child prodigies. From breakdancers to pianists to pint-sized photographers, these are the young spirits who awed us with their talent, slayed us with their cuteness and made us feel painfully inadequate with their accomplishments. 
May we humbly present the 12 tiniest, and most talented, child prodigies who made a splash in the art world this year. Prepare yourself for lots of squeals, ""awww""s and spurts of low self-esteem.
1. Avery Molek, 6 years old
Meet Avery Molek, a six-year-old drummer who experienced his 15 minutes of YouTube fame in 2013. In a video that made the rounds last March, the tiny drummer can be seen shredding his way through Van Halen's ""Hot For Teacher,"" barely missing a beat as he plays the classic song like a pro. Read more about Molek here.
2. Malik Kofi, 11 years old
At a height of just over five feet, an instrument like the cello nearly eclipses the body of 11-year-old child prodigy Malik Kofi. But that didn't stop the young musician from impressing the best of his adult contemporaries with his unbelievable classical music skills. “He’s an extremely talented cellist,"" said Udi Bar-David, player for the Philadelphia Orchestra, ""very creative, mature, has stage presence, is open to learning and has strong ideas of his own."" Read more about Kofi here.
3. Hwang Min-woo, 7 years old
Although the seven-year-old boy's given name is Hwang Min-woo, you may know him as ""Little PSY."" The young dancing machine went viral this year after performing an impressive rendition of PSY's iconic pony dance alongside him in ""Gangnam Style."" He also released an electro, K-pop song on iTunes this year and is painfully adorable, especially when donning a suit and sunglasses. Read more about ""Little PSY"" here.
4. B-girl Terra, 6 years old
A six-year-old breakdancing prodigy named ""B-girl Terra"" put all adult dancers to shame in a YouTube video that circulated earlier this year. The miniature competitor took part in the Chelles Battle Pro competition in Paris, blowing away the rest of the contestants with her unbelievable windmills and headspins. Read more about the B-girl here.
5. Tyler Clemons, 4 years old
Like most four-year-olds, little Tyler Clemons enjoys banging on objects around the home. So what separates him from the rest of his destruction-prone peers? The answer: a pair of drum sticks and the label ""child prodigy."" In a video posted by Louisiana news outlet KPLC, Clemons grinned widely as his mother described him as a prodigious drummer. ""He just wouldn't stop banging on things. All day, everyday,"" she says. Prodigy? We're not so sure, but we can't help but want to pinch his cheeks. Read more about Tyler here.
5. Autumn de Forest, 11 years old
  Autumn de Forest, ""Jasper Map""
Child prodigy extraordinaire Autumn de Forest rose to fame a few years ago when, at the tender age of seven, the Discovery Channel labeled her a ""child genius."" Media outlets at the time were enamored with her painting abilities, praising the child for her tendency to create canvases that, well, looked like the work of established artists -- and the praise continued in 2013. An adult artist might get slapped with the ugly term ""derivative,"" but how can one do that to a child? It's not fair. We're reminded of Joan Acocella's 1994 New Yorker piece, ""Discussing the Undiscussable,” where she writes of an artist being ""beyond the reach of criticism."" And yet, how can we approach the work if not critically? Read more about Autumn here.
6. Umi Garrett, 13 years old
If you know the name Umi Garrett, it's probably due to a certain performance of hers on the Ellen Degeneres show, which undoubtedly will go down in history as one of the cutest musical performances to ever be televised. Umi, who was only eight years old at the time, won our hearts with her gifted piano skills and enviable cotton candy frock. She also has a pretty adorable Twitter account. In 2013, five years after her big break, we checked in with Umi, who was preparing herself for teenage life. Update: she continues to tour and play piano and, in her spare time, rocks out to One Direction. Read an interview with Umi here.
7. Fuji, 3 years old

Nigerian photographer Onafujiri ""Fuji"" Remet made a name for himself earlier this summer when his work was showcased in a Lagos exhibition. Aside from his curious eye and ability to capture the color and motion of Nigerian street life, Remet received attention for his miniature stature -- he is three years old after all. Yes, you read that right. Little Fuji learned to man a Sony SLR before most of us could spell our names. His photos capture everything from street vendors to family portraits, from an unusually pint-sized vantage point. Fuji's early initiation to the art world can be attributed to his creative family. His father and two older sisters are artists as well. At present, the ambitious young photographer has 3,000 images to his name, according to Visual News. Not bad for a toddler. Read more about Fuji here.
8. Caesar Sant, 4 years old
NC Child Prodigy Suffers from Debilitating Disease
Caesar Sant is a four-year-old child prodigy with a gift for playing the violin. He started learning the instrument just over a year ago and, as you can see in the video that circulated this past year, is already impressing instructors with his adorable renditions of ""The Star Spangled Banner."" However, beyond his talent for the violin and knack for reading complicated sheet music, the young genius suffers from a rare form of sickle cell anemia that's caused Caesar to have two strokes in a period of six months, one of which resulted in the temporary loss of mobility in his bowing arm. According to the Winston Salem Journal, his family, including neuroscientist father Lucas Santos, have turned to a stem cell bone marrow transplant -- a $500,000 procedure offered through Johns Hopkins University -- as the ""only cure"" for the young boy. Read more about Cesar here.
9. Rhema Marvanne, 11 years old
Rhema Marvanne's solo rendition of ""O Holy Night"" is heartbreakingly moving, and she was just seven years old when she recorded it. The tiny songstress has a heavenly voice, and she takes inspiration from someone that she believes is up above as well-- her mother Wendi, who died from ovarian cancer in 2008, just one year before this song was recorded. Marvanne told the Fort Hood Sentinel, “When I sing, it makes me think of my mother, which makes me happy. I want to take my gift that makes me happy and share with those who are still sad and try to make them happy again.” Read more about Rhema, who we covered in 2013, here. 
10. Ryan Wang, 5 years old
Ryan Wang, the adorable five-year-old piano prodigy who captured Ellen Degeneres' heart earlier this year, has another unexpected admirer. Her name is Dorothy Landry, and she's 101 years old. Thanks to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Landry was recently able to enjoy her very own private recital captured in the video above. Although she'd seen Wang perform before, she's hard of hearing, so this up-close experience was invaluable. Read more about Ryan here.
11. Amira Willighagen, 9 years old
When nine-year-old Amira Willighagen from Nijmegen in the Netherlands stepped onto the ""Holland's Got Talent"" stage, no one was expecting such a big voice to come out of such a very little girl. Her incredible rendition of Puccini's ""O Mio Babbino Caro"" from the opera ""Gianni Schicchi"" earned her a Golden Ticket from the judges that would take her straight to the live show. It's hard to believe how young Amira is, but even more surprising to learn that she is completely self-taught, and used only YouTube tutorials to learn how to sing. Read more about Amira here.
12. Malachi Samedy, 9 years old
Nine-year-old Malachi Samedy has been drumming since before he could walk. He got his first drum set at 24 months, was admitted to music school at age four, and by the time he was seven, was close to realizing his dream of performing for President Obama. ""When he was younger, he would just bang on everything,"" Malachi's father, Nasser Samedy, says in this HooplaHa video, ""My wife was saying, 'You know, he's a drummer.'"" Malachi has been wowing older professional musicians with his talent ever since. What's more, he's using his talent to bring attention to causes that matter, commonly visiting children's locations to share his music and positive message. Read more about Malachi here.

9,ARTS & CULTURE,Planned Parenthood Protesters Take The Spotlight In Eerie Street Photos,Maddie Crum,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/planned-parenthood-protesters-photos_us_56fd86d3e4b0a06d58054bfc,A street photographer explains why he sets his lens on protesters and their controversial signs.,2016-04-01,ARTS & CULTURE,"When Robert Lee Bailey’s girlfriend needed a colposcopy, the couple went to a Planned Parenthood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to get the procedure done. It wasn’t his girlfriend’s first time at a Planned Parenthood; she’d had a colposcopy done there before, and was mistakenly confronted by protesters who thought she was there for an abortion.
“She was so stressed out about going there [again],” Bailey told The Huffington Post. “Not only because she thought she might have cancer, but because she was worried that the protesters would be there.” 
So Bailey, a street photographer, tagged along, and snapped photos of the protesters, many of whom he had conversations with unrelated to his own political beliefs.
“At first, most of them were OK with it,” Bailey said. “They just asked that I didn't blind them with the flash. They even offered to take me to lunch. And they would ask me if I was pro-choice, but I never wanted to talk about that. I always danced around the issue, and I never tried to argue with them or anything like that.”
But, once Bailey’s opinions came to light, the protesters asked him -- with increasing hostility -- to stop photographing them. He says some of them claimed he needed a model release form, which isn’t the case. Street photographers have the legal right to capture individuals in public places, even if the ethics of doing so are hazy.
Portraying subjects negatively without their consent isn’t illegal, but for some street photographers it raises questions. Expressing a popular approach, street photographer Ron Haviv said in an interview with Feature Shoot, “In many cases, if I point a camera toward someone, and there is no negative reaction, I feel fine in taking the image. If they say no, verbally or otherwise, I respect their choice.”
Bailey feels similarly, and stressed that many of the protesters acted kindly toward him, in spite of having differing beliefs. But, he said, “If you don't want to be photographed, if you don't want to attract my attention as a photographer, don't stand out here on a busy street holding a controversial sign.”
Many of his photos spotlight said controversial signs, including one that reads, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you -- God.” Each is shot using a bright flash that lights the subjects from below, creating an ethereal glow or, sometimes, a horror movie effect.
Several subjects are captured with their palms blocking the camera, demonstrating their desire not to be photographed, and creating an air of intrusion. 
“I hope the mood is austere and a little frightening,” Bailey said. “I think one of the central themes is invasion of privacy. I was photographing people who did not want to be photographed, even though they were protesting in a public space. But I trespassed on their personal space and took the photos anyhow. I think it sends a message that they're doing the same thing. They're invading people's right to medical privacy, as well.”

It's about time.",2017-06-15,ARTS & CULTURE,"After 46 years, Yoko Ono is finally receiving the credit she deserves. The iconic multidisciplinary artist was officially credited as a co-writer of the 1971 song “Imagine,” currently attributed to Ono’s deceased husband, John Lennon. 
The news was announced Wednesday at a meeting of the National Music Publishers Association by its CEO, David Israelite. He also bestowed “Imagine” with the Centennial Song award. 
“While things may have been different in 1971, today I am glad to say things have changed,” Israelite said. “So tonight it is my distinct honor to correct the record some 48 years later and recognize Yoko Ono as a co-writer of the NMPA centennial song ‘Imagine,’ and to present Yoko Ono with this well-deserved credit.”
He then played an archival interview, in which Lennon explains that the song would not exist without Ono. “[Imagine] should be credited as a Lennon-Ono song,” he said. “Because a lot of it — the lyric and the concept — came from Yoko. But those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, and I sort of omitted to mention her contribution. But it was right out of Grapefruit, her book. There’s a whole pile of pieces about ‘imagine this’ and ‘imagine that.’”
Seven years before “Imagine,” Ono self-published Grapefruit, a little gem of a book, unruly and quiet at once, filled with strange wishes and demands. “Imagine your body spreading rapidly all over the world like thin tissue,” one line reads. “Imagine cutting out one part of the tissue.” 
Sean Lennon accompanied his mother, Ono, who uses a wheelchair, onstage to accept the Centennial Song award. According to Lennon, the artist welled up with tears upon hearing the announcement. Onstage, Ono said her waning health has heightened her appreciation of the song and imbued her with a magnified esteem for being alive, Variety reported.
“This is the best time of my life,” she said, to applause.
Congratulations, Yoko. It’s about time.

12,ARTS & CULTURE,What Would You Do To Spend Valentine's Day With A 'Bachelor' Star?,Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bachelor-auction-ashley-iaconetti-nick-viall_us_56c35350e4b0b40245c7f7f0,"Would you wait in a coat-check line for an hour? Would you battle through hundreds of other women? Would you pay $5,000?",2016-02-16,ARTS & CULTURE,"It’s 9:30 p.m. on a frigid NYC Valentine’s Day, and JJ Lane, recent alum of “The Bachelorette” and “Bachelor in Paradise,” is standing on a banquette at The Ainsworth in Chelsea, hollering insults at former co-star Joshua Albers. 
The target of Lane’s playful wrath continues to smile gamely through selfies with eager young women, all dressed in their rose ceremony best (lace bodycon dresses, teetering heels, sequins), as Lane gives Albers the finger. The semicircle of ladies gathered around Lane, in as many tight rows as an onion has layers, grows fidgety. “JJ, get down here,” one yells, grabbing at him. 
The “Bachelor” fans are here for charity, and they need their selfies.
A few weeks ago, I thought I’d spend Valentine’s Day the normal way -- on the couch, ordering calorie-dense takeout and scrolling through the on-demand options for a few hours with my fiancé. Sometimes, though, duty calls. Duty doesn’t care about your brick oven pizza plans. When I heard tell of a New York City-area charity auction and watch party for the 20th anniversary “Bachelor” special hosted by Ashley Iaconetti (she of the teary lashes), I knew my night would be spent marinating in a -- er -- different kind of romantic atmosphere. Emma Gray, who co-hosts HuffPost’s “Bachelor” podcast “Here to Make Friends” with me, would be on a well-deserved vacation, so I would be repping the podcast alone, and I was ready.
Without doubt, it would be the most fan-favorite-filled night in “Bachelor” history. Aside from Iaconetti, “Bachelorette” icons including Nick Viall, Jared Haibon, JJ Lane and Ben Zorn would be auctioning off a precious hour of their time to benefit THON, all while the year’s most adorable reality TV couple, Jade Roper and Tanner Tolbert, tied the knot on approximately 47 hi-def TVs all around the venue. 
I bought a ticket -- $65, to benefit charity. Cocktail attire was requested, perhaps in order to create a natural habitat for our “Bachelor” stars. I curled my hair and eyelashes and put on a dress I would describe as “from Urban Outfitters.” I also put on a coat I would describe as “enormous,” because it was 2 degrees out, and sallied forth. I had lip gloss in my purse. My heart was open. My “please come on HuffPost’s reality TV podcast” pitch was ready. “Can I steal you for a second?” hung on the tip of my tongue. This journey was just beginning.
When I arrived, the first thing I noticed was the coat check. Several minutes later, I noticed the line for the coat check, which was not where I thought it was. The 45 minutes I ultimately spent in this line, while frustrating, especially as I did not arrive with a buddy to send off to the bar for coat check line drinks, did at least provide me with ample opportunity to scope out the crowd. 
It was very, very female. I saw a couple of men, who were pretty clearly attentive significant others or the advertised “Bachelorette” stars. But that’s hardly a surprise, given that the show is coded so female -- most women showed up in pairs or small gaggles, while it may be more embarrassing for even men who enjoy the show to admit to friends they’d like to go. Besides, Iaconetti was the only advertised gal on the auction block. At the event, she herself told Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan, the fashion bloggers known as the Fug Girls, that male fans often seem to watch the show along with their wives or girlfriends and approach her simply to say hi, not hit on her. 
For the Nicks and Joshes in the club, the fan attention leaned more carnal. A handful of the endless waves of women in attendance seemed like sweet, eager fans, fresh-faced in flat shoes and everyday hair, just looking for a moment with their favorites; the majority looked ready to volunteer for a sudden opening in one of the “Bachelor” limos. Professional blowouts and barrel curls bristled in every direction. The eyeliner game on display made me ashamed of my own half-hearted smoky eye. Dresses had been chosen to flaunt curves; heels for their pencil-slim height. Manicured hands clutched at rose-hued cocktails as necks craned searchingly, seeking any nearby “Bachelorette” heartthrob. 
When the “Bachelor” bachelor auction started, this attention became more focused, as all the semi-celebs were pulled up to the auction block. Nick Viall was entrusted with auctioning off his compatriots, starting with Ben Zorn, a clumsily hunky fan favorite who quickly sold for around $1,200, despite some confusion amongst the auctioneers about who was actually bidding and who was just being effusive. (This would be a problem throughout the night.) A lull followed, as Albers, Lane and Josh Murray went for prices in the high hundreds. Jared Haibon, the sweet bartender adored by viewers -- and Ashley Iaconetti -- modestly cracked a thousand. Michael Garofola, an NYC-based attorney, leveraged his purportedly cute new puppy to sell himself for over $5,000, as Iaconetti and Viall clearly began to feel a bit intimidated by the realness of the money being pledged. Iaconetti went up for auction, though I didn’t spot a single unattached man present except for those onstage. Her friend Haibon gallantly snatched her up for around $700, then stepped up to shill the inimitable Viall himself, a two-time ""Bachelorette"" runner-up, to the crowd. Not much shilling was needed, and the frenzied bidding war ultimately carried the prices up to an all-night high of $5,600. (I mean, he is a pretty decent conversationalist.)
As the auction ended, the stars dutifully spread through the club, circulating among the non-auction winners for selfies (in her pre-event message, Iaconetti requested “as few retakes as possible”). Almost immediately, each man found himself the sun at the center of a tightly swirling solar system of squealing, iPhone-wielding women. A couple rows back, the ladies were more calm and calculated, scanning the room for a better Bachelor, or a Bachelor with a smaller crowd around him to penetrate, or just casually judging (“Ugh, I just don’t get it,” you’d hear in passing as a small gaggle of girls swept disdainfully past Haibon as he held court). 
In my personal life, I have a deeply socialized desire not to seem pushy or demanding that overcomes me at events like this. It’s partly why the aggressiveness of the other female fans present awes me. How did these women escape the near-universal messaging that men hate forwardness, that acting semi-predatory will seem grotesque and unladylike? Lane himself told me later that he actually relishes rejecting women who approach him, a satisfying reversal of the mating role he’s used to. Is the fandom of Bachelor Nation's women stronger than their socialization? Are they refusing to let their fears hold them back from what they want? Is society truly getting more equal? I put this complex anthropological question aside as I elbowed through a tight knot of women to introduce myself successively to Lane, Albers, Iaconetti, and Haibon. I was there to make professional contact. But also, I felt a little flutter of excitement in my stomach. I was actually seeing these people in real life. 
I mean, not that I care.
Soon, the night started to wind down. The “Bachelor” alumni were scheduled to end the evening with 45 minutes of one-on-one time with their winning bidders in the VIP area at the back of the club, and the rest of us filtered out. 
Well, most of us. Viall told me the next day, as he and Lane joined me on the podcast, that his second-place bidder hung around meaningfully, waiting for him to finish his bought-and-paid-for date so she could whisk him away herself, despite the numerous requests to leave.  
And it wasn’t just during the auction date -- watching “The Bachelor” had seemingly induced some bad habits all around. “Some women would come up,” Viall said, wincing, “and be like, ‘Hey, can I steal you…’ and I’d be like, ‘I can’t really leave.’” The ladies of NYC were there for their romantic meet-cute, one worthy of the show itself. (Actually, he emphasized, the vast majority of them were very nice and appreciative of their selfie moment and brief chat. For the record.) “Our lives suck,” joked Lane, who seemed simultaneously exhilarated and exhausted by the avalanche of female scrutiny and desire.
Ah, to both long for and fear the demands of romantic attention from the opposite sex -- what's that's like? ""The Bachelor"" dudes might just be experiencing what it's like to be the hot girl at the bar, but more so, and as we all know, that's a position that's fraught with both benefits and serious drawbacks. But for Lane, Viall and co., there isn't much time to ponder this: They've got selfies to take.

14,ARTS & CULTURE,'Hamilton' Star Wayne Brady Says To 'Fight For The Arts' In Trump Era,Lauren Moraski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hamilton-star-wayne-brady-makes-plea-to-fight-for-the-arts-in-trump-era_us_588669d9e4b0e3a7356b1d1f,"""During these four years, what are you going to fight for?""",2017-01-26,ARTS & CULTURE,"Wayne Brady is thrilled to star in the Chicago production of “Hamilton” ― not only because, well, gosh, it’s “Hamilton,” but also because his stint comes at a key time in this country.
Just last week, The Huffington Post reported that President Donald Trump’s administration might shut down the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. That means funding for national arts and humanities could decline, or worse yet, all but disappear.
Brady, who currently portrays Aaron Burr in the musical, says with Trump in the White House, it’s more important than ever to support arts programming and initiatives, in addition to plenty of other important causes and rights that could be at risk.
“It’s happened and it’s happening,” Brady told The Huffington Post. “And it’s going to happen for four more years. And the reality of it is no matter where you fall — if you are pro-Trump or anti-Trump, he is the president. And what are we gonna do?”
“I think we need pieces of art like this to keep that fire burning so you just don’t fall into a slope, like, ‘Whatever, it’s four years,’” he continued. “No, during these four years, what are you going to fight for? Fight for the arts. Fight for LGBT rights. Fight for the rights of every minority who gets kicked in the ass with every one of Trump’s cabinet members being placed [in office].”
Brady is no stranger to theater, having previously starred on Broadway in “Chicago” and “Kinky Boots.” So, it’s not surprising that the all-around entertainer would make a plea like this.
“Go out, support the arts, [support] the things that he [Trump] is killing … By doing ‘Hamilton’ not only am I supporting arts, but I’m in art,” he said. “I’m a trumpeter for the rights of all of us, especially being a black man in this country.” 
Of course, one could argue that “Hamilton” ― with its diverse cast and its historical storyline ― resonates even more now with what’s happening in current national politics. But Brady says his interest in “Hamilton” first piqued in 2015 when Lin-Manuel Miranda launched the now Tony Award-winning musical.
“Ever since this began ― pre–Donald Trump circus ― it’s resonated with what it means to be an American … Like the line, ‘Immigrants, we get the job done.’ My folks are from the Virgin Islands,” Brady said, “just like [Alexander] Hamilton. It’s inspirational to know that this little chain of islands can produce such greatness.” 
Brady stars in “Hamilton” at Chicago’s PrivateBank Theatre through April 9.

As a young successful entrepreneur, I'll be the first to admit that I spoiled myself with all the new gadgets, clothes, and gifts for friends and family. I stood countless hours in line to get the ""doorbuster"" items and spent all night shopping trying to score the best deals. 
Donate To Improve Your Finances
Have you ever thought about the gift of donating to a charity or a cause instead? Or better yet, have you ever thought about how donating to a charity can help improve your finances? I know it sounds counter intuitive to think that giving money away can improve your finances, but you'll be surprised. Here are three ways on how donating can actually help:
• One reason why most Americans fall into debt is the difficulty of separating your needs vs wants. It's a skill set that seems obvious at first glance, but difficult to execute. Why not donate your holiday budget towards charity? In doing so, you'll have to fight the temptation of spoiling yourself on luxuries. Fight the urge to spend money on unnecessary gifts! Fight the urge to buy items just because it's on sale! You can't spend money that you don't have right? One of the greatest financial lessons I've learned over the years is to put priorities first before pleasure. If you can master this art, you're already one step ahead of improving your finances.
• If you're not in the best financial shape, the thought of donating can be a catalyst for you to start thinking about your finances. The first thing that comes to mind should be, ""How much can I afford to donate? $25? $50? $100? ""It's something that requires thought for most people. For example, if you decided that you could afford $50 in donations, you may also begin to think about how you can save $50 in the next few weeks. Perhaps you'll cut down on dining out or cancel the weekend partying with your friends. The mere thought about finding ways to reduce and/or eliminate some expenses is a huge step in improving your finances.
• And last but not least, donating money for a cause reminds us that no matter how bad our financial situation can be, there are millions of people who'd like to be in our shoes. Instead of focusing on material objects and what you think you want, think about how fortunate you are compared to other people. It gives us encouragement and hope that we can face any curve ball life throws at you. No one said it would be easy to reach your goals right? It takes dedication, persistence, and determination to reach all financial goals. 
Is Donating a Lost Cause?
I know some of you may be thinking that donating is a lost cause. I felt the same way. Big non-profit charities have huge overhead expenses: management salary, operational costs, and even marketing. For every dollar you donate, only a fraction goes towards charity while the rest goes towards operational expenses. I'm a huge believer in donating to a specific cause or project. 
If I ever decide to donate money to a charity, I want to make sure that every dollar is going towards a good cause as opposed to paying an executive's salary. One of my favorite charities to donate to is an organization called Givology, which was awarded the top rated non-profit in 2012. Givology is a 100 percent volunteer-run organization that connects donors to students and grassroots projects around the world. You can select a student or a project and donate directly to their cause. It's a rewarding feeling knowing that every single dollar is going towards a charitable cause.
Another one of my favorite non-profits is Kiva. Kiva is a micro lending platform to connect donors to entrepreneurs in third world countries. Donors get paid back with interest overtime. One of the best gifts you can give to the less fortunate is the opportunity that we were all once given.
Donating your money isn't going to magically improve your finances, however, reaching your long-term financial goals is a long road that requires precise planning. If you can separate your needs versus wants, find ways to trim your expenses, and have a burning desire to reach your goals, you've taken a huge first step.

An unidentified United States Postal Service worker in Birmingham, Ala., was caught on video Monday apparently removing some packages from a USPS-branded mail delivery van and then hurling them off a steep embankment by the road. You can see the hurling in question in the video above. 
When reached for comment by the Alabama Media Group, Special Agent Kenneth D. Smith of the USPS crime investigation unit said that the employee resigned from the USPS on Thursday after the video went viral on social media. Smith declined to identify the worker by name. 
""As with any ongoing OIG investigation, I can't comment on specifics,"" he added.
The whole thing sort of reminds us of when a USPS driver was caught on camera last year driving over a homeowner's lawn to deliver a package:

18,MONEY,Why the YOLO Generation Has It All Wrong About Money,"Kali Hawlk, Contributor
Freelance Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-the-yolo-generation-h_us_5b9deaf5e4b03a1dcc8eb2df,"Yes, you only live once. That is an inescapable truth that applies to us all. What is not true is that you have to ""just get by"" financially in order to really live. You can really live right this very moment and save for your future.",2014-03-10,BUSINESS,"We all know that the Millennial generation got a bad break out of the gate: many of us graduated college and attempted to enter the workforce during the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. But now we're six years out from when the market crashed in 2008. The economy is recovering and more employers are hiring. 
And yet Generation Y is likely going to continue struggling financially for decades to come. We've got two major factors working against us: a massive load of (mostly) student loan debt and jobs that offered us low starting salaries, if we managed to get a job at all.
At first, a low starting salary doesn't sound like it would equate to a lifetime of financial difficulty. But here's the problem: when the economy is struggling and the job market is tight, salaries and wages drop. Any employers who are hiring suddenly have a vast pool of talent to pull from, and they can secure great workers at less cost to the company. When you have hundreds of candidates vying for one administrative assistant job, you're bound to find one competent person desperate enough to work for $10 an hour and no benefits. Why offer a $40,000 annual salary when there are recent grads begging for work and will accept $28,000? 
When the economy recovers, those starting salaries might recover, too. But that's no help to members of Generation Y who started low. It's hard to make up those initial losses, and the result is that Millennials continue to struggle financially. 
Oddly enough, however, there is a large corp of Gen Yers who seem to have embraced these troubles. They are romanticizing the idea of just getting by in your twenties and thirties, and instead of fighting to become more financially stable and secure, they're accepting as a fact that you're not supposed to stop living like a broke college student until you're like, I dunno, 40 or something, bro.
These are the Millennials who claim money is the root of all evil. They are the ones who excessively use #YOLO as an excuse to live without worrying about the future, because who knows? Tomorrow is promised to no one, guys! Better to live it up now and come within pennies of overdrawing your checking account every month on the off chance that you'll keel over dead in the next week.
These twenty- and thirty-somethings say those who are worried about making money are fools. That those seeking to build wealth are mindless slaves, destined to die without having really lived life. 
The YOLO Generation is the one that fails to see it is they who are slowly selling themselves into that slavery they claim the rest of us are victims of currently. They fail to see that the shackles of working yourself to death for a paycheck that they so fear are the only possible future life for them. They are happy to spend every last cent they have because their fiscal irresponsibility is justified by the fact that you only live once -- which is true, but that logic starts failing when people end up living a long, healthy life with no form of retirement savings.
The YOLO Generation has been fooled into thinking just getting by is a romantic notion and the only way to be truly free. They feel enlightened by their belief that money is evil. They do not understand that money is neither good nor evil, but rather a tool that can be leveraged to secure true freedom: financial independence. 
The YOLO Generation will continue to be complacent with just getting by instead of seeing that while Millennials have struggled with a unique set of problems, we've also been gifted with brand-new opportunities. With the rise of online businesses and the digital economy, there has never been a better time than now to become an independent freelancer or entrepreneur. But for the twenty-somethings who have bought into this twisted idea that making money for yourself is somehow bad are missing out on these incredible opportunities. 
The YOLO Generation will be happy to ignore the future reality they are facing: that without any form of savings, without any ability to make money for themselves, their only option is to continue working. Their only option is to continue slaving away for The Man, because when they are old and gray they will desperately need what they so earnestly reject now: money.
Yes, you only live once. That is an inescapable truth that applies to us all. What is not true is that you have to ""just get by"" financially in order to really live. You can really live right this very moment and save for your future. You can really live while working toward financial independence, which offers you the freedom to do what you want since it releases you from the obligation of working for a paycheck. You can really live and have enough money left over to invest and build wealth with if you prioritize your spending and value your experiences and relationships over material possessions. You can really live by taking charge of your career and starting your own side hustle or business instead of being complacent with the bare minimum salary that some employer will try to get away with offering. 
What the YOLO Generation got wrong is that there is nothing wrong about wanting to earn money and build wealth. In fact, that's a rather smart move -- and the sooner you start, the easier it is thanks to the power of compound interest. Wanting to increase your net worth does not make you greedy or imply that you're somehow failing to live while you're young. What it does mean is that you're establishing the ability to choose your own way in life instead of being shackled to working for someone else because you need a paycheck every week to continue ""just getting by.""

Unfortunately, the system is still massively broke.",2014-09-08,BUSINESS,"The 21st century organization requires bold leaders who understand they live in a world of opportunity to create and lead others around a shared purpose. Unfortunately, the system is still massively broke. Most so-called leaders are stuck leading 20th-century organizations where they delegate their responsibilities to functions. Someone else ghostwrites their blogs and makes sure diverse teams are built. And then they wonder why they have a disengaged and homogenous workforce.
Stuck in the Old World
We have old world concepts like engagement and empowerment flying around the corporate walls. No one really wants to admit they don't know what they mean or more importantly, what to do with them. Have you ever seen an empowered workforce? Was it words on a PowerPoint slide or an HBR article? 
Listening has become a transactional event of running an annual employee survey or performance management meeting. Why have we lost the ability to conduct two-way conversations whenever they are needed? Why is it that we talk to our customers regularly and then practice archaic management practices when it comes to what we publish on our Intranets as our ""most important assets""? Why are people still called headcount where on a financial spreadsheet, furniture is an asset and people are a liability?
Wake up to the New Reality
It's time to wake up and realize it's a new century in a world of possibilities and opportunities that are not in the mainstream but on the edges. Leadership today is also on the edges since we don't have to follow the prescribed solutions that don't work in our new world of work. Leaders who get this no longer delegate their communication to a function. They work out loud and experiment while leading with conscious purpose.
Some Leaders Are Breaking Through
I am lucky enough to partner with such a leader and see her in action building an engaged network of innovators. She listens and takes risks. She doesn't wait for the annual survey to listen. She brings in the best internal an external talent to drive her organization to the next level. I have experienced one brave leader who leads through creating and doing.
And we need many more to practice conscious leadership as the workforce is changing so fast and those who are stuck will not survive what is about to take place in the world of work. No technology in the world will help unless we start shifting and integrating the technology into our business rather than trying to lead with it, which ultimately fails. It's about re-imagining leadership in a post-hero world where every person can make a difference. 
And it's definitely not easy. If it was, everyone would be doing it. There is no cookie cutter approach as the new model of leadership requires knowing how to deal with failure and disappointment and stepping into unchartered territory. The 21st century leader is a dreamer who sees the possibilities by creating new markets. She leaves the job for competing for marketshare to someone else. And taps into people in all generations across all geographies with drive and purpose on a human level.
Do you know 21st century leaders? What makes them lead with the courage to be vulnerable and create healthy organizations that thrive?

20,BUSINESS,Focus On Micro Businesses For The Next 30 Years,"Sramana Mitra, ContributorFounder, One Million by One Million",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/focus-on-micro-businesses_b_13692182.html,,2016-12-17,BUSINESS,"
I have written several pieces under The Future series title:
- The Future - Genetic Engineering? - The Future - Destructive Technology Trends - The Future - End Of Capitalism - The Future - The Problem With Longevity - The Future - Technology Without Philosophy - The Future - The Most Important Entrepreneurial Challenge Of Our Time - The Future - Age Of Idiocracy
Now, if you agree with my prognosis that both blue collar and white collar jobs are going to disappear at a massive scale due to automation, then you must ask yourself, what is a constructive direction forward?
I have two answers to this question.
The first is a look at the next 30 years. The second is a longer term, beyond 30-year view. 
Inequality, Fortune at the Tip of the Pyramid: Today's Entrepreneurial Capitalism is driven by venture capital, which has an inherent tendency to create very large fortunes, but very few of them. How many Googles have you heard of? How many Facebooks? And thus, fortune accumulates in the hands of a few, very few people. In 2014, the top 1% of America's wealthy owned 40% of the nation's wealth. Fortune has been steadily accumulating at the tip of the economic pyramid.
Fortune in the Middle of the Pyramid: My observation, however, is that in Silicon Valley, we have learned a LOT about how to build successful businesses following the principles of Capitalism. If this knowledge can be broadly disseminated, and a much larger number of entrepreneurs start building successful businesses - doesn't have to be billion dollar businesses - can be million dollar businesses - that would drive fortune in the middle of the economic pyramid. And that is both possible today, and necessary today, given everything else that is going wrong in the global economic system.
Democratic, Distributed Capitalism: My vision for Capitalism in its next phase is a distributed, democratic capitalism whereby millions and millions of entrepreneurs build small and medium businesses that are profitable and sustainable in the long term. In other words, we need to create fortune in the middle of the pyramid.
Entrepreneurship Education, Incubation, Acceleration: So how is this possible to accomplish? The answer to this question is not finance. It is education. In fact, again, the entrepreneurship ecosystem is misreading the challenge and running after financing as the solution. I don't believe that. I believe entrepreneurship education is of paramount importance. And that is what will drive broad adoption of a Capitalistic system of value creation as well as wealth creation, although, more modest than the billionaire fortunes. No, we will not create a million billionaires and that kind of excess is not necessary.
Brexit: Greece Example: Just to give you an example, the morning after the Brexit vote, as Europe watched in horror, I spoke with a Greek entrepreneur who runs a $5M company called MarineTraffic. People are leaving Europe in droves right now. Europe is a fine example of the kind of disaster that Socialism creates. And yet, here, Demitris Memos had created a successful business from Athens that speaks to my vision: democratic, distributed capitalism. As of July 2016, youth unemployment rate in Greece stands at 50.3%. Spain is at 43.9%. Italy is at 39.2%. France is at 24.4%. It's a dreadful, tragic story of several lost generations. If Europe could mint a million entrepreneurs like Demitris, the continent could be saved.
1M/1M Vision: This is my work today. In 2010, I founded One Million by One Million - 1M/1M for short - the first global virtual accelerator in the world. Our mission is to help a million entrepreneurs reach a million dollars and beyond in annual revenue, build a trillion dollars in global GDP and 10 million jobs. We run this out of Silicon Valley but work with entrepreneurs all over the world.
What we do: The program is first and foremost an online educational program where you get to learn the nuances of technology entrepreneurship from over 700 successful entrepreneurs. We also do active mentoring, and make introductions to potential customers, channel partners, investors, media, analysts, etc.
Freshdesk example: One of the companies from the program, Freshdesk, has raised almost $150 million in venture capital and has some 40,000 customers around the world. The company was born in Chennai, but has moved headquarters to San Francisco recently. I am very proud of Freshdesk.
Siliguri example: I am, however, equally proud of a different type of entrepreneur that I have encountered through our work. You see, we do these free online mentoring sessions every week. One day, a first year college student from Siliguri, a small town in India in the foothills of the Himalayas, came to the mentoring roundtable and pitched an idea that he was working on. He wanted to use Uber-style GPS-enabled technology to power a small business delivery network in his regional market. I found it fascinating that this boy had come up with a decent concept, found 1M/1M, and was pitching this to me, half a world away. And this happens every week. We work with entrepreneurs from all corners of the world - not just India, but Africa, Asia, Latin America. And of course, US and Europe continue to be big markets for our work.
Optimistic in the next couple of decades: I do believe entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial capitalism can be democratized, and wealth can be created in the middle of the pyramid using capitalistic principles. In the next 2-3 decades, the potential for distributed capitalism is very high and the outcome should be extremely positive around the world.
Bootstrapping with a Paycheck: Now, the job loss due to automation has already started, as we speak. So, for those in large corporations, I have a simple word of wisdom: start a small side business while you still have a job. Bootstrap your startup with your paycheck. This way, if the axe falls, you have a fallback position.
Older Engineers: Layoffs, please note, tend to skew older. The white-collar job loss that is coming will impact older engineers (and older workers in general) much more severely. Start preparing now, while you still have a job, and line up your ducks. You will need to build a micro business of your own.
Beyond 30 years: In the 30-50 year timeframe and beyond, technology and automation will create tremendous disruption. 60-80% of ALL jobs will, likely, get automated. At that point, Capitalism fails, and the only solution would be Universal Basic Income.

But very few of those biz babes get the opportunity to appear on ABC's hit show, Shark Tank. Even fewer of those ladies actually walk back down that long, dark hallway with a deal in hand.
Jenny Greer and Erin Bickley of Macon, Georgia not only appeared in The Tank and got a first time partnership deal (with both lady sharks Barbara and Lori), they thrived shortly thereafter with their collection of products from their women's shape-wear business Hold Your Haunches.
At the time of their TV appearance, the ladies had a $165,000 sales year. Six short months after their appearance and partnership, they had one-and-a half million in sales and going strong.
Touching base with these amazing Georgia peaches is an inspirational story and a vision of what it looks like to go from real-life, struggling entrepreneur to successful momma CEOs seemingly overnight (but it wasn't that easy).
The first topic of discussion was around some of the struggles they faced, both now and then. Erin and Jenny said that ""ignorance was bliss"" for them. They really just started by seeing a need and jumping in, developing their first prototype. The lesson? Take one step, then another, then another. Just one at a time.
""The struggle wasn't really visible, we were busy getting things perfected like the marketing and building a brand,"" the duo said. In other words, they were deep in making things happen, one step at a time.
Post Shark Tank, Erin said that overnight the business really became a full time job which was tough, especially between with their respective husband's and kids' needs.
""We love the example that we're setting for our kids though, especially our daughters. You really can do anything if you try,"" both ladies agreed.
Business partnerships do sometimes crash and burn and some people get sick of each other or decide to go their separate ways. Both Jenny and Erin agreed that it's important to ""make sure that you love the person because you're with them all of the time."" Partnerships are totally possible, not easy all of the time, but possible.
They do love being around each other. They pointed out that their partnership has really gotten them through some of the hard times and that they've been a security blanket to each other in the more difficult stages. The partnership was an asset for them.
""I can't imagine doing this alone,"" They both agreed.
When asked about one piece of advice for other ambitious business mommas, the ladies chimed in saying, ""There are things that are totally out of your control, just get things ready as much as you can. We've had server glitches before and things like that. Just tell the truth to your customers. What you put out comes back.""
Excellent advice from two ladies continuing massive growth of their now successful business, a business we're sure to see a lot of in the years to come, and proof that anything is possible.

Helping individual investors build and protect their wealth",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/financial-fraud-seniors_us_5b9b4a36e4b03a1dcc765ffd,"Seniors tend to rely more on the assets they've accumulated, as they may no longer be earning a steady income. Combined with being intellectually vulnerable, this makes them attractive prey for would-be scammers.",2012-03-01,BUSINESS,"Have you ever received an email or phone call promising the investment opportunity of a lifetime, if you'd only be so kind as to share your bank account information and social security number? If so, then you were a potential victim of financial fraud, a crime that comes in many shapes and sizes.
Senior citizens are a growing target for financial scammers. A survey on elder fraud from Investor Protection Trust estimates about 20 pecent of unsuspecting retirees become victims of financial fraud. According to a June 2011 MetLife report, seniors lose more than $2.9 billion a year to financial fraud. That amount is up 12 percent from 2008. But, since many cases of fraud go unreported, these numbers may in fact be far higher.
With the increasing proportion of aging baby boomers -- who account for about a quarter of the U.S. population -- criminals have a wealth of potential victims. According to the same Investor Protection Trust study, one in every five Americans over 65, or about 7.5 million people, has lost money through financial fraud.
Why are retirees so vulnerable? As described in our article ""How Our Aging Brain Affects Our Financial Decisions,"" after age 60, one's cognitive facilities weaken, making the elderly more susceptible to poor decision making. No matter how well-educated we are, financial literacy and savvy decrease as we age, according to Harvard University economics professor David Laibson.
Seniors tend to rely more on the assets they've accumulated, as they may no longer be earning a steady income. Combined with being intellectually vulnerable, this makes them attractive prey for would-be scammers.
And, with more North Americans retiring in debt, they're that much more likely to be tempted by fraudulent ""get rich quick"" schemes. A 2011 AARP Public Policy Institute survey found nearly 15 percent of retired Americans had difficulty paying their credit card bill, rent or mortgage.
Those with money in the stock market may be scrambling that much more. Since the October 2007 market peak, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen approximately 10 percent to date, even taking into account the healthy rally so far this year. As a result, some investors may have lost much of their retirement savings and are looking for quick ways to recoup losses.
All these factors can lead to financial desperation, making retirees particularly easy targets of financial fraud. But, don't let yourself fall victim. You can help prevent financial fraud by following these four steps:
1. Beware of ""Safe"" Returns Higher Than Six Percent.
Unless you're investing in high-yield stocks such as REITs or MLPs, use caution if you come across a financial guarantee which promises a ""secure"" return of 6 percent or more. According to Pat Huddleston, founder and CEO of the private investigative firm Investor's Watchdog, scammers currently lure retirees by offering returns between 6 percent and 8 percent. This yield is not outrageous, but with North American interest rates currently hovering around 1.5 percent, it's wise to probe how a credible financial institution can offer so much more than the average bank. Before you buy, verify the organization's credibility. Often the money you invest is capital you can't afford to lose.
2. Know What You're Investing In.
If you've never heard of a Turkish Eurobond that gives quarterly returns 8.5 percent, or a gas fund that's guaranteed to produce $8,500 in monthly income, it's probably because these securities don't exist. If somebody gives you a sure-fire investment lead, familiarize yourself with it before you commit to a purchase. Practice informed investing as a general principle. Turn to credible websites like our sister site, StreetAuthority, for well-researched investing tips from recognized stock pickers.
3. Avoid the ""Suckers List.""
As a rule of thumb, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is (a scam). With that in mind, don't sign up for sweepstakes, incredible travel giveaways or suspicious free gift offers. According to the National Consumers League fraud center, once the scam bait has been taken, your contact information may end up on a ""suckers list,"" where it's collected and then sold to outside parties. From that time onward, you will likely find yourself receiving a plethora of fake mailings and phone calls.
These are harmless enough, albeit annoying. But, as we age, our ability to discern the credible from the not so credible decreases. Retirees in the early stages of diseases like dementia or Alzheimer's may be that much more prone to fall for illegitimate phone or mail money-grabbing ricks. To find out whether the offer you're receiving is legitimate, you can read about the latest financial schemes at both the Federal Trade Commission and National Consumer's League websites.
4. Beware of the Grandparent Scam.
One frightening scam comes as a call from someone pretending to be a family member needing money. The criminals often do intensive research on the potential victim's family, so their story may sound credible. For example, they might pose as a grandson who was arrested on a trip abroad and needs money wired immediately. If this happens to you, ask the person if you can call them back later and immediately check the facts with your family. Never give money to anyone without verifying their identity.
The Investing Answer: Avoiding financial fraud may seem like common sense, but the elderly must be extra careful about every financial decision. Stay informed and do extensive research before you sign away any of your retirement savings. Of course, there are plenty of other scams out there, including phony charities asking for donations, advance-fee loans, fake checks and identity theft. You can read more about how to protect yourself from identity theft in this InvestingAnswers feature, ""5 Frightening Facts About Identity Theft.""

23,BUSINESS,How To Take Advantage Of Trending News Stories,"Catriona Pollard	, ContributorDirector of Australian PR and social media agency, CP Communic...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-take-advantage-of-_3_b_13737280.html,,2017-01-08,BUSINESS,"Nowadays it can be a real challenge to cut through the noise and stand out in the media. But an excellent place to start is by taking advantage of the stories that are already getting noticed.
Breaking news stories, the latest trends and current affairs are more likely to capture your target audience's attention, generate social sharing and encourage brand engagement.

Seizing stories that are trending in the news and online, a concept known as 'newsjacking' is an excellent way to get key messages in the media, provide expert opinions and build thought leadership.
Here are some strategies to follow when looking to take advantage of trending news stories.
Pick the right story You need to be able to determine which stories are going to work for the message you have crafted. Only leverage stories which would engage your audience and relate directly to your brand and business.
For example, if you run an insurance company and you notice a lot of stories in the media about rising insurance premiums, you can pitch yourself to a relevant journalist as an expert to comment on these issues. 
Be prepared  Be proactive and prepare for all possible opportunities. Think about topics which relate to your area of expertise and brainstorm any possible news events that could be related to these topics. You can then reactively pitch to news outlets when a similar story emerges. 
Media and social media monitoring A big part of this process is monitoring the conversations in the media and on social media. By keeping up to date, you will be better able to pick up on stories that will work. 
Following journalists and news outlets on Twitter is an excellent way to keep informed of all breaking news stories and find media opportunities. Twitter allows you to organise followers into separate lists which can make it easier to view recent tweets from journalists and news outlets. 
Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have streams which showcase what news stories and topics are the most popular with users. 
Accessing these trending topics provides an insight into what your target audience is talking about and what content they are engaging with. 
Be timely Timeliness is very important in terms of capitalising on breaking news. It is important to be aware of what's going on in your industry. 
When you do find something relevant to your industry and have something appropriate to respond with, it is a good idea to post a response through your social media, through a blog post, or reach out to the media. 
Be resourceful When responding to a trending news story, it is important to be as informative and resourceful as possible. Provide journalists with new material they haven't directly written about before and ensure that you are offering an expert opinion or advice to back up your story.
Offering a different angle to current trending stories is an excellent way to pique a journalist's interest in your story. 
It is important to remember that not every news story will be suitable to respond to. You need to approach leveraging trending news stories ethically and sensitively. Think about the ways that you can use real time engagement authentically. 
With the right approach, preparation and consideration you can leverage the latest new stories and trends to get noticed.

24,BUSINESS,"Women in Business Q&A: Fiona Smythe, Vice President of Strategy, mscripts","Laura Dunn, ContributorSocial Media and Communications Professional, Founder and Edit...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-in-business-qa-fion_b_7474628.html,,2015-05-30,BUSINESS,"As Vice President of Strategy at mscripts, Fiona Smythe manages a cross-functional team that sets strategy, defines product direction, creates and executes marketing strategies. Her team focuses on leveraging mobile technology to deliver compelling patient engagement and medication adherence solutions for pharmacies. Fiona is passionate about creating mobile solutions that will improve patient outcomes, keep patients healthy and address the global issue of medication non-adherence.
Prior to mscripts, Fiona held several management positions with start-ups and global enterprises, including Amazon.com and Informix Software. Fiona holds a BA in Comparative Literature from Williams College and has done graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley.
How has your life experience made you the leader you are today? I grew up as an ex-pat kid in Panama. My dad was an English biologist doing research for the Smithsonian and my family was very intellectual. At the same time, I went to school with American military kids and was immersed in Latin American culture. Because we were living overseas, my parents sent me away to boarding school in Massachusetts, where I was again, pretty different from the kids I met there. While it was really hard to leave home when I was 14, having to figure things out for myself at that age made me very resilient and gave me a lot of self-confidence. I think the experience of being different; both culturally and ethnically, also gave me a real appreciation of the potential that comes from cultural diversity, but also an appreciation for diversity of thought. Today, if you look at my team at work, I've got someone who's very literary, an architect who moved over to do UX work, woman who started out as a mechanical engineer, and a software engineer. . We're focused on helping people manage their medications to keep themselves healthy, tackling the new field of mobile health in new and creative ways. We many different constituents, of varying ages, and with a varying exposure to technology (a fifth of our user base is over 50.) With that in mind, our apps are available in both English and Spanish, we've worked with the American Foundation for the Blind to make sure it's highly accessible, and we use a lot of help tips to ensure that users understand how features work. We saw that many of our users were asking to manage medications on behalf of their family, so we introduced family accounts. Today, an astounding 80% of those family accounts are managed by women. 
How has your previous employment experience aided your tenure at mscripts? I think there have been two jobs that have really helped me. I worked at a startup that was bought by Amazon.com, and when I went there, I really got a crash course in consumer marketing and customer service. At Christmas time we'd work all day, and then we would all go and pack books at the warehouse until 2 or 3 in the morning. That singular focus on making the customer happy is something I think is the hallmark of a great business, and we emulate that at mscripts. We work very closely with our pharmacies to gather requirements for new product features, and we spend a lot of time understanding what their customers are looking for. The other job was teaching an entry-level English class as a graduate student at UC Berkeley, which taught me to bring both an analytic and an empathetic lens to coaching and providing feedback. When you are trying to teach someone how to write, you have to be very precise and very logic-driven, but you also have to understand how painful the process of taking feedback on something you've worked incredibly hard on can be. I try to bring that to my work at mscripts, encouraging attention to detail, improvement through iteration, and working outside of your comfort zone in order to expand it.
What have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at mscripts? They are really two sides of the same coin. Growing from a very small to a medium-size start-up was very challenging and also incredibly rewarding. You have to build process and increasingly specialize as you go from 4 people to 70, and that can sometimes be really hard, when you're taking an employee who has previously been responsible for four or five areas in the company and asking them to focus more and more on one. Likewise, it's hard to impose process where it hasn't existed in the past.
What advice can you offer to women who want to start their own business? 1) Have confidence that you can be the boss. I was having lunch with a friend of mine recently who had a great idea for a company in the health tech space, and she kept talking about finding a CEO to run her company. I finally asked her why she felt she had to bring someone else in to run it. She's a smart, competent, experienced professional, and yet she didn't feel somehow that she could be the top person. This doesn't seem to be an anxiety that men cope with, at least not to the same extent. 2) If you, like my friend, feel you lack an area of expertise that's preventing you from succeeding, hire someone to work for you who can fill that gap. Don't feel you have to be able to do it all. 3) Work with people you like and trust.
What is the most important lesson you've learned in your career to date? How be a 'maker', how to hire other 'makers', and how to create an environment that fosters creative work. It's really difficult to start a project from scratch and carry it through to completion. Of course, when you are building your own company and creating something completely new you have to do this on an on-going basis, and everyone on your team has to be able to do it too. At mscripts, we often talk about makers and consumers. In a lot of large and medium-sized companies it's easy to become a consumer of pre-packaged work, but if you want to be successful in a small company, you constantly have to build things yourself. Things I do with my team to support this: I give them ambitious but achievable goals and help them set a timeline; I meet with them at least once a week, and often multiple times a day, to check in on their progress; I encourage brainstorming and team cross-pollination; I try to make it ok to fail, because failure should be a waystation on the way to success, not an ignominious end point. 
How do you maintain a work/life balance? I wish I were better at this! My husband and I work together right now, which simultaneously makes it easier and harder for me. On the one hand, I get to commute to and from work with him, and I see him throughout the day. On the other hand, it's really hard for us to turn off work when we're home. I am obsessive about work, so over the years I've decided I can focus on two main areas in my life well, or try to do more, but poorly. So besides work, my main focus right now is on time with my kids. I put aside two or three hours at the end of the day to do homework with my girls. I insist that we always have dinner as a family. I read to my younger daughter before bed, and I make time to do things with my older daughter that she loves, like walking our dogs or dancing in the kitchen. We ski together during the winter, which is great family time, because they are awesome skiers.  What do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace? I started working in the valley in 1992, and my experience then was very different from what is being reported on today. I had a great experience of working mostly with nerdy men, and I mean that in the most complimentary way, who were interested in creating new ways of living through technology, whether that was the power of unlocking data or new ways of conducting commerce. I found it a fairly egalitarian environment if you were smart and hard working. However, I've been saddened by the recent press around sexism in Silicon Valley. The challenges that young women are facing now include the same old issues that we've always faced, like glass ceilings or having access to childcare or family leave, but also new issues like getting funding bias and outright harassment at work. As this new wave of highly accomplished young women are coming out of college they are moving into an environment which is weirdly anachronistic in its aggressive behavior towards their aspirations and who they are. I am encouraged that many of them are speaking out on the topic, and I hope they are able to take that experience and turn it into something positive.
How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life? When I was just starting out I had a great female mentor who gave me my first real break, letting me manage the Latin American marketing department for a large software company, a position which was a real stretch for me. Now that I'm more experienced, I find that mentoring others is incredibly rewarding and I enjoy every opportunity I get to encourage other women. If I had one recommendation to young women it would be to actively seek mentorship. If there's not a person in your network who can provide that for you, go out and find someone experienced to help you. People love to give advice. When we were just getting started at mscripts we brought in a great advisor, Ken Ross, who helped us strategize on how to transition from a start-up to a mid-sized company. His ability to mentor us based on his past experiences was invaluable to me individually, and mscripts as a company.
Which other female leaders do you admire and why? There are women I admire in the abstract, like Judy Faulkner at Epic, because they've built large companies, they are tough and smart, and they've succeeded in a competitive marketplace, but I am really lucky to have lots of friends who are women who, like me, have gone back to work after having kids, and done something risky - they've started their own small companies and built new marketplaces. So Mariam Naficy at Minted, who has changed the way we think about and buy holiday cards, stationery and art, Anna Brockway at Chairish, who is changing the way we buy and sell used furniture, and Maryam Mohit at Gemshare (and now Nextdoor), who is changing the way we recommend services to friends, are all women who I deeply respect and admire. They've all started their own companies, balancing work and family, and are really dedicated and passionate about what they do.
What do you want mscripts to accomplish in the next year? We are partnering with our pharmacies to help patients get access to and understand their medications, and to take them as directed. Around half of U.S. patients with chronic conditions don't take the medications they need to address their condition, and that has serious consequences. Medication non-adherence leads to 125,000 deaths annually and contributes to about 10% of hospital readmissions. It has also been estimated to contribute to between $100 and 150 billion in annual costs to our health care system. We are working with our network of pharmacies to deliver educational resources, coupons, reminders, and lifestyle support directly to people's phones. At the same time, we're using surveys and the data that we gather to understand non-adherence better. So our goals are ambitious - we hope to have a measurable positive impact on the health of our customers, and to provide them with a convenient and easy way to manage their health.

26,BUSINESS,Union Workers Help Hurricane Sandy-Ravaged Neighborhoods,Lila Shapiro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/union-workers-hurricane-sandy_us_5bb2daa1e4b0480ca65d59af,"Many union workers are among the hardest-hit by the storm, but still worked long days. According to Jim Brown with the Long",2012-11-03,BUSINESS,"STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- At a time when public approval of labor unions is near an all-time low, union workers are charged with much of the dirty and dangerous work of cleaning up after Hurricane Sandy. Here, along one the hardest-hit stretches of New York waterfront, union workers fixed Internet connections, disconnected gas pipes to prevent explosions and patrolled the streets in cop cars and ambulances.   In other the storm-devastated regions of New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut, union workers are repairing and clearing roads and bridges, restoring phone service, turning the lights back on, getting the subway lines back on track, repairing homes, operating hotels where families are taking refuge from their flooded neighborhoods, and nursing injured survivors back to health. And that's to say nothing of the unionized police officers and firefighters who, as in Staten Island, seem to be stationed on every corner in zones with heavy damage.  ""Once again, we’re seeing how the working people of America pull together when things get hard and their efforts save lives,"" said Vincent Alvarez, president of the New York City Central Labor Council. 
According to a Gallup Poll from August 2012, (http://www.gallup.com/poll/157025/labor-union-approval-steady.aspx) 52 percent of Americans approve labor unions, a rate up only slightly from the all-time low of 48 percent in 2009. The wave of anti-union sentiment of the last few years has arguably had significant political consequences, most notably the arrival of the Tea Party class of Republicans in Congress two years ago and the anti-union efforts championed by the likes of Gov. Scott Walker (R) in Wisconsin and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).  Those developments raised big questions concerning the labor force: Should workers have collective bargaining rights and paid vacation days? Do unions bolster the economy or weaken it? On Friday, people in the flood-ravaged areas seemed unconcerned about those questions. ""We'd welcome anyone,"" said James Gafney, 32, standing outside his debris-strewn Staten Island home.  Larry Lutz, a steamfitter with Local 638 on Staten Island, was among the union workers helping the cleanup in Midland Beach, a devastated neighborhood in Staten Island. He couldn't go to his actual job on Friday -- his construction site was still underwater -- so he decided to help friends in the neighborhood where he grew up, hauling trash and damaged belongings out of basements and ground-floor apartments. ""To me this is a catastrophe, and there should be more manpower,"" he said.  Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Communication Workers of America, said unionized technicians at Verizon, AT&T, and Cablevision are working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, to restore service. The union also represents 60,000 public workers in New Jersey who are cleaning and repairing bridges and roads and taking 911 calls, she said.  In Connecticut, AT&T crews were dispatched with disaster equipment as Hurricane Sandy neared so that workers could respond quickly, Johnson added.  Union volunteers have played a big role in clearing the downed trees in eastern Queens, according to Sally Frank, campaign manager for Nily Rozic, a community leader running for state legislature. Volunteers from Local 79 and Local 1010 of the Laborers contacted Rozic shortly after the storm, Frank said, and arrived with ""good spirits and saws and got to work immediately.""
Many union workers are among the hardest-hit by the storm, but still worked long days. According to Jim Brown with the Long Island local International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union, his members ""left their families, many with flooded and damaged homes, and came to work, some before before the storm hit, and have remained there working 16-hour shifts. That has left them with only eight hours to travel home, rest, cope with their own situations, and return to work again."" 
School was still cancelled on Friday, but Arthur Nallario, 37, and his colleagues -- teachers at a Staten Island high school and members of the United Federation Of Teachers -- were doing what they could around the battered borough. Nallario was biking through the hardest-hit waterfront areas to hand out fliers advising residents of locations for food and supplies, how to apply for FEMA funding, and letting them know about an Internet access and phone charging station that would open Monday at the high school. ""I think union workers have really come together to help their communities,"" said Nallario, who has lived on Staten Island his entire life.

27,BUSINESS,Obstacles for Women Reaching the Top: Unconscious Images,"Caroline Turner, ContributorAuthor, workshop facilitator, speaker, consultant",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obstacles-for-women-reach_b_5484743.html,"If tooting your own horn is hard for you (a common thing among women), PRACTICE. Or ask a colleague or sponsor to ""toot"" on your behalf (and do that for others).",2014-06-13,BUSINESS," 
In exploring reasons why women are still not proportionately represented at the leadership levels of American business, we get down to what McKinsey & Co. calls invisible ""mind-sets."" These mind-sets give rise to obstacles - for women and gender diversity. One such obstacle is what I call ""unconscious images."" Like the other mind-sets (the double bind and the comfort principle), this cause is neither malicious nor intentional. Consciousness of its existence, and its impact in the workplace, can lead to inclusive behaviors and cultures.
Anyone who has been alive at least nine months has ""pictures"" of how certain things look. For example, if I ask you to picture a CEO (close your eyes and do that), chances are you will not have an image of a short, plump, woman of color. Most people will imagine, in fact, a lean white male -- because that is what we most commonly see. And he will be tall. One study says that the average Fortune 500 CEO is over 6 feet tall, 2-3 inches taller than the average man!
If business leaders share this ""tall white male"" image of power and success, but are unconscious of it, there are advantages for people who fit this image. If someone ""looks the part,"" he may be more likely to get to try out for the role. When thinking about whom to consider for an important project or promotion, someone who ""looks the part"" is more likely to come to mind than someone who does not. 
This is about more than appearance. Styles of leadership either do or do not fit the historical image, which includes ""leading from the front."" Someone who leads collaboratively may be seen as lacking leadership, despite great team results. A talented person who does not ""look the part,"" is more likely to be overlooked. There may be more focus on how this person acts than on actual contributions. The boss cannot imagine this person at the next level. 
I do not believe we can eradicate our unconscious images. The goal is to make leaders aware of them so they can monitor their impact and make more enlightened (and inclusive) choices in making assignments and promotions. Think about this very human phenomenon as a blind spot. You are aware of the blind spot in your car. Before changing lanes, you compensate for the blind spot. If you are aware that you have pictures of how leadership or success ""looks,"" you can push the ""pause button"" on your automatic thinking. Do this when you feel judgment about someone or when you are doing performance evaluations or considering making a promotion. Are you NOT seeing a person's results or contributions because he or she does not ""look the part""? When filling a job or team, are you NOT thinking of someone who could do a great job but does not fit the usual image?
What can women and others affected by unconscious images do? If your style of dress or hairstyle is very different from the norm in your organization, consider whether you might make some changes. (Conforming a little in appearance need not mean giving up your authentic style.) Take it on yourself to be sure your boss (or person evaluating you or handing out good work) knows about your skills and your results. Acknowledge that your approach may be different but show how it has worked well. If tooting your own horn is hard for you (a common thing among women), PRACTICE. Or ask a colleague or sponsor to ""toot"" on your behalf (and do that for others). 
What you have done to make sure you do not make choices based on who fits your unconscious images? What have you done to minimize the negative effects of unconscious images on you and others?

For the fourth year in a row, the real estate company Zillow has ranked the top 20 cities for trick-or-treating. This year, San Francisco topped the list.
Despite the common perception that wealthy cities are the best for trick-or-treating, Zillow determined the list based on four factors: home value, population density, walkability of the neighborhood and crime data. Given how much money we're expected to spend on Halloween this year, it may be worth strategizing a bit to ensure you're getting the best bang for your buck while hunting for candy. 
This year, it is estimated that the average American will spend $24 on Halloween candy, according to Foodbeast. Men will outspend women by an average of $4.58 and the age group that will spend the most on candy is 25-to-34-year-olds.

29,MONEY,Who's Watching Your Holiday Spending?,"Terry Savage, Contributor
Nationally syndicated financial columnist, author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/whos-watching-your-holida_us_5b9db13fe4b03a1dcc8b8ece,"The worst penalty isn't a lump of coal in your stocking. It's a lowering of your credit score -- something that impacts your future cost of credit, and even the cost of homeowners and auto insurance.",2013-12-12,BUSINESS,"It's not only Santa who's watching to see who is naughty or nice! In fact, while you're playing Santa, the credit bureaus and credit scoring companies are keeping track of how much you spend as a percentage of y our credit limits. And in January, they'll be watching to see how you repay all the cards you used this holiday season.
The worst penalty isn't a lump of coal in your stocking. It's a lowering of your credit score -- something that impacts your future cost of credit, and even the cost of homeowners and auto insurance. Your credit score ranges from 300 to 850 -- and is probably the most important personal score since you took the SAT exams! A score at the top of the range gives you access to the best deals and lowest rates on major purchases.
Your credit score is derived from all the information on your credit report. By now, you probably know that you're entitled to a free credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus every year. The easiest way to access that totally free report is through AnnualCreditReport.com, which offers direct links to each of the bureaus, without requiring you to sign up for credit monitoring or credit protection programs.  Typically, those credit reports show similar information, because they are simply a compilation of information reported to them by the companies with whom you do business -- credit card issuers, mortgage lenders, medical providers and insurance companies. Information -- good and bad -- stays on your credit report for seven years, until it ""ages"" off, to be replaced by newer (and hopefully better) credit information. (Bankruptcy stays on your credit report for ten years.) You can challenge reported information and correct errors by contacting each bureau.
Your credit score is a sort of ""secret sauce"" formula, or algorithm, created by any of several companies as an easy way to grade your credit performance. Your credit score is a number that reflects a snapshot assessment of how risky it is for a company to extend credit to you.  Some of what goes into your credit score is simply a matter of record: how long you've lived at the same address, had the same job, or held your oldest credit card. There's not much you can do about that. But there are things you can do to impact and improve your credit score, or downgrade it. Simply asking for a new credit card, closing an older card, charging up a greater percentage of your credit limit, or paying only the minimum required monthly payment can all impact your credit score.  Getting Your Score
The oldest and most widely used score is the FICO score -- the original score created by the Fair Isaac Company (thus, FICO) many years ago, when it was rarely disclosed to consumers. Now, you can get your score at www.MyFico.com at no charge. But it comes with a 10 day free subscription to ScoreWatch, which you must remember to cancel immediately or you'll be charged $14.95/month for at least 3 months!
Now, Discover Card is offering a free look at your FICO score, which will be printed on Discover card monthly statements sent to primary Discover cardholders. This may be a temporary promotion, but it is being highly advertised.
At Experian-owned FreeCreditScore.com, you can get your Experian credit score and use the Experian ScorePlanner tool for a payment of just $1. (But if you don't cancel within seven days, you'll be signed up for a membership at $17.99 per month, which includes credit monitoring, fraud alerts, and access to fraud resolution agents.)  When you sign up for the $1 trial, the credit report information that is behind your score is used to ""pre-populate"" the slider calculators on the ScorePlanner tool. The tool is designed to show you how your personal credit behavior impacts the risks which lenders perceive about as they make and price their credit decisions.
You can move the sliders on your computer screen to see how behaviors such as adding a new credit card, increasing the percentage of available credit you are using, inquiring about opening new credit and making late payments have on your credit score.
Obviously, the credit bureaus and scoring companies know that you're interested in ""the number"" that they've been compiling. It's being used as a way to bring in subscribers to their various credit-watch monthly services.  Credit Score and Non-Profit Credit Counseling
There's one more way to get your credit score. The National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) has joined with Experian, which has donated 80,000 free, 12-month memberships to its above-mentioned website in order to help consumers not only understand, but < improve> their credit scores. It's all part of the NFCC's Sharpen Your Financial Focus program, aimed at empowering consumers to manage credit wisely.
If you go to www.SharpenToday.org, you can start with a visit to the ""MyMoneyCheck-Up"" section of the NFCC website, an online financial self-assessment tool. You can also take advantage of a one-on-one review with an NFCC Certified Financial professional. And then, you can qualify for the free membership that gives you a year of access to not only your credit report and credit score, but to credit monitoring and alerts, and to the Experian ScorePlanner tool, as well.
Now, as you head into the holiday shopping season, is the perfect time to gain control of your credit. Take advantage of the NFCC program. The credit counseling can be done over the phone, and it isn't reserved for people ""in trouble."" NFCC wants to help those just starting out, and those caught in a rut of making minimum monthly payments. Going through their counseling program does not impact your credit, and is not reported to the credit bureaus.  Since all your lenders know the score, don't you think it's smart to get help to change your money behavior and increase your score? So get started today at www.sharpentoday.org -- or by calling NFCC at 855-374-2773. It's free -- and when the bills start arriving in January, you'll be glad you knew the score during the holiday shopping season. That's The Savage Truth.

Consumer Debt Expert & Firefighter",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bankruptcy-filings-down-i_us_5b9c7ddae4b03a1dcc7f2610,"While it is doubtful that in the next decade or so we will see debt relief service demand at the levels experienced in 2009-2010, we should see a greater demand in the next three to five years. It will just take time to reload the consumer debt pipeline.",2012-11-07,BUSINESS,"The latest statistics out of the United States courts show that bankruptcy filings are dropping. That's good news for consumers and bad news for companies that sell debt relief services.
According to filing data, the number of non-business bankruptcy filings for the same year-on-year period ending Sept. 30 has significantly dropped. Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing dropped from 1,036,950 to 874,337. That a decrease of almost 16 percent. Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings dropped from 417,530 to 375,521 -- a decrease of about 10 percent. Non-business bankruptcy filings in total were down from 1,467,221 to 1,261,140 -- a decrease of filings of 14 percent.
Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing as of Sept. 30, 2012 account for about 67 percent of all consumer bankruptcy filings. Clearly still the vast majority.
As of Sept. 30, 2012 the three states with the highest incidence of bankruptcy filings are: 
Nevada Tennessee Georgia
The three lowest are:
Alaska District of Columbia North Dakota
Even the month-on-month numbers look like there is a decreasing demand for consumer bankruptcy protection. This in combination with the historically low consumer credit default rates, certainly paints a picture that we may have reached the bottom of the decline for debt relief services and the demand to solve massive problem debt from the recession. The only residual factor would be if there remained a backlog of consumers that might still turn, in higher than usual numbers, to a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to deal with a still ongoing mortgage problem.
If we look at the change in demand for both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy from November 2011 to September 2012 we can see that in general the month on month reduction in demand for each chapter. As you can see in the accompanying chart, the demand in reduction is spending more time in the positive area. A positive number reflects a reduction in filings from the month before.

While it is doubtful that in the next decade or so we will see debt relief service demand at the levels experienced in 2009-2010, we should see a greater demand in the next three to five years. It will just take time to reload the consumer debt pipeline.
Even consumer default rates continue to decline. Numbers out from Discover just today state the default rate in September is down 1.5 percent from the same period a year ago.
As statistics begin to show us there is an increased demand and use of unsecured consumer credit and rebounding consumer confidence, it will signal a return to people loading up on debt again. This will lead to a greater demand for debt relief services in the future. But the latest statistics out from the Federal Reserve today show that revolving credit decreased at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent, while non-revolving credit increased 6.5 percent.
We need to keep our eyes on the growing balances of essentially secured private student loan debt as part of non-revolving debt. As those levels increase it will prevent consumers from indulging in as much unsecured credit as before. This will put a damper on consumption and the need for debt relief services like credit counseling and debt settlement.

As early as next year, Pennsylvania judges could receive risk assessments -- statistically derived tools based on age, sex and prior arrests -- to help them decide how likely a criminal is to commit more crimes and sentence that person accordingly. Anna Maria Barry-Jester, a public health reporter for FiveThirtyEight, talked with HuffPost Live on Monday about how this form of sentencing would work for the state.
""They take a lot of information about people who commit crimes and see what characteristics are most associated with reoffending,"" Barry-Jester told host Alyona Minkovski. ""So then they come up with something that's sort of like a questionnaire, and try to determine the risk of a person who's like that person in terms of if they will reoffend.""
 Watch Barry-Jester describe risk assessments for prisoners and the danger of unfair biases against certain groups in the video above.

An audio tape of radio calls from the shooting has been posted on YouTube by PhillyFireNews.com, and captures the exchange between an emergency dispatcher and one of the firefighters who was shot. 
PhillyFireNews.com notes that they have posted the tape, ""to show the true bravery of the firefighter who was shot and pinned down due to the gun fire. Our thought and prayers go to all affected in this horrible tragedy."" 
In the nearly nine minute recording, one of the firefighters identifying himself as “125” tells dispatcher, ""We are being shot at, multiple firemen down. I am shot. I think it was an assault rifle."" The firefighter can be heard saying that he needs an ambulance and that he's been shot in the lower back and leg, adding that he was pinned down by his firetruck, which he crashed as the gunman opened fire. 
Lt. Mike Chiapperini, 43, a volunteer firefighter and Webster Police Department’s public information officer, and firefighter Tomasz Kaczowka, were shot and killed, while Theodore Scardino and Joseph Hofsetter were also shot, but are recovering in guarded condition at Strong Memorial Hospital.
The shooter has been identified as William Spengler, 62, a convicted murderer, who spent 17 years in prison for killing his grandmother in 1980.

36,CRIME,Cop In Walter Scott Shooting Reportedly Heard Laughing Afterward,Ed Mazza,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-slager-laughing_n_7052618.html,,2015-04-13,CRIME,"
Michael Slager, the South Carolina police officer caught on video shooting an unarmed black man who was running away after a traffic stop, is reportedly heard in new audio laughing about his ""pumping"" adrenaline immediately after the incident. 
The audio was obtained by The Guardian newspaper, which said it came from the dashcam of Slager's police cruiser and was recorded in the hour after he shot and killed 50-year-old Walter Scott on April 4. 
In the recording, a man the paper identified as Slager can be heard asking an unnamed senior officer what would happen next. 
""They’re gonna tell you you’re gonna be out for a couple of days and we'll come back and interview you then,"" the senior officer is heard saying in the clip. ""They’re not going to ask you any kind of questions right now. They’ll take your weapon and we’ll go from there. That’s pretty much it.”
The senior officer also urged Slager to write down his recollections of the incident. 
“The last one we had, they waited a couple of days to interview officially, like, sit down and tell what happened. By the time you get home, it would probably be a good idea to kind of jot down your thoughts on what happened,” he advised. “You know, once the adrenaline quits pumping.” 
“It’s pumping,” Slager said, laughing as he spoke. 
The dashcam caught the early moments of the incident, in which Slager pulled Walter Scott over for a broken taillight. It did not capture the shooting, which happened outside the view of the dashcam but was recorded by an eyewitness. 
A spokesman for the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, which is investigating the shooting, told the Guardian that they have not been able to independently confirm the audio but said that ""it appears"" to be Slager. 
Slager was fired and has been charged with murder.

Dennis Thomas Murphy Jr. was arrested and arraigned in a federal court in New York City on a charge of operating a commercial vehicle while under the influence, said Nellin McIntosh, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. The complaint unsealed on Wednesday said 151 passengers were onboard the flight on April 21, 2015, and Murphy had been selected for random alcohol testing upon landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York. JetBlue officials could not be immediately reached for comment on Wednesday. Murphy, who is from New Jersey, was released on a $50,000 bond cosigned by his father and spouse. His attorney, federal defender James Darrow, could not be immediately reached for comment. A breath test showed Murphy had a blood alcohol level of .111 percent, the complaint said. A second test showed him having a level of .091 percent. ""During the walk to the onsite testing office at JFK Airport, Murphy's face was red and he was chewing gum rapidly,"" the complaint said, adding that he attributed the high ratings to the gum he was chewing. A blood alcohol level of .1 or higher qualifies as being under the influence for criminal charges, the complaint said. The Federal Aviation Administration prohibits pilots from flying with blood alcohol content higher than .04, according to the regulator's website. Earlier in the day, Murphy also piloted a flight to Orlando International Airport from New York with 119 passengers on board and his co-pilot told authorities that Murphy was drinking an ""unknown beverage from a cup"" before and during both trips, the complaint said. Murphy was immediately removed from being able to fly JetBlue planes and had resigned from the airline by May 27, 2015. He was hired by the company in February of that year. Last month, an American Airlines co-pilot was charged for drinking alcohol before a weekend flight out of Detroit. (Reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco.)

38,CRIME,Coroner Reclassifies A Man's Suspicious Death After HuffPost Investigates,David Lohr,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shawn-arthur-death-reclassified-louisiana_us_5ad8ebace4b03c426dac880c,An incarcerated woman said that she and her partner were involved in Shawn Arthur's death.,2018-04-20,CRIME,"NEW ORLEANS ― The death certificate for Shawn Arthur, a man who died after meeting a woman through a dating app, has been changed from “accidental” to “undetermined.”
While the reclassification might eventually push the case into a courtroom, it’s not sitting well with Arthur’s father, who wanted it changed to “homicide.”
“I am truly disappointed, but not totally surprised,” Bob Arthur, 69, told HuffPost. “Obviously the investigative facts were ignored or twisted.”
The change in classification comes two weeks after HuffPost detailed what 27-year-old Dominique Berry said about what really happened to Shawn Arthur.
A Louisiana native with a lengthy criminal record, Berry claims that she and her partner, 36-year-old Randy Schenck, drugged Shawn Arthur so they could steal his belongings in late February 2017. When the 40-year-old was found dead in his apartment shortly afterward, his death was labeled “accidental,” despite compelling evidence suggesting foul play.
The issue with the revised death classification is that “undetermined” still encompasses accidental, natural or homicide. It basically means there is no one theory that outweighs the others regarding the cause and manner of a person’s death.
A homicide classification would have required only that the coroner’s office find that Arthur’s death resulted from a deliberate act by another person, not necessarily with an intent to kill.
Berry’s account, along with other evidence uncovered by HuffPost and two private investigators working for the Arthur family – Michelle Gomez and Jane Holmes – was among the materials examined last week by the Jefferson Parish Coroner’s Office. The evidence, which prompted the involvement of federal authorities, shows how Berry and Schenck allegedly targeted men on dating apps in at least six states. Berry estimated that she and her partner, who are behind bars in Georgia in connection with another case, victimized up to 100 men.
Dr. Marianna Eserman, the forensic pathologist who performed the original autopsy, and other members of the coroner’s office were among those to sit down and review the Arthur case last week. The Arthur family’s attorney, Michael Kennedy, said he was not permitted to attend the meeting.
In a Tuesday statement to Kennedy, Eserman said the review of the case was complete and it was determined that Arthur’s death did not meet the criteria to be ruled a homicide. The pathologist said that while Berry had admitted to drugging men, she’d never said that “she remembers Shawn Arthur or his apartment.”
Yet prior to the meeting, Kennedy had provided Eserman with copies of three interviews in which Berry discussed the Arthur case. Among them was a Feb. 27 interview with HuffPost, in which Berry acknowledged going to Arthur’s apartment.
“I just called him and went to his house,” Berry said of her interactions with Arthur after they connected on a dating app.
Berry not only admitted drugging Arthur, but also claimed she was at his apartment when he passed out.
“He was snoring very loudly,” she recalled.
Kennedy said he is “outright angry” that the coroner’s office is claiming they cannot place Berry at the crime scene ― especially since police already have.
“Her fucking fingerprint was found there, so she was obviously there,” Kennedy told HuffPost.
Eserman gave HuffPost a different explanation as to why the case could not be reclassified a homicide. “We have no definitive proof under what circumstances Mr. Arthur ingested medications and alcohol,” she said in a Thursday email.
Eserman said Berry’s interviews were reviewed, but she did not respond to a follow-up email that pointed to specific statements Berry had made about drugging Arthur.
In her interview with HuffPost, Berry said she’d first attempted to drug Arthur by mixing a cocktail of prescription drugs with liquor. She said that attempt failed when the drugs did not completely dissolve and wound up stuck to the bottom of the glass.
“He didn’t drink it because there was like the ones that was still stuck in the cup,” Berry said.
The sheriff’s report indicates a shot glass with an unknown substance was found during a search of Arthur’s apartment.
In a Feb. 15 interview with Holmes, one of the private investigators, Berry said she found it was easier to mix the drugs with beer. Empty beer bottles were found in Arthur’s apartment, along with several pill capsules in which Berry had allegedly concealed the drugs.
“Of course, I drugged him,” Berry told Holmes. “I gave him two capsules of pills, then I took him to the bed, laid him down, massaged him and relaxed him, and he fell asleep.”
Berry told HuffPost that generally after drugging a victim, she’d encourage the individual to consume large quantities of alcohol.
“When they drink half a bottle of beer, that’s when you put the pill in because it won’t fizz over,” she said. “Then I’ll do like a chug game or something like that.”
Several alleged victims of Berry and Schenck told HuffPost that they have no memory of what happened from the time they consumed an allegedly spiked drink until they woke up hours later, with a bad hangover.
Dr. Gerry Cvitanovich, the Jefferson Parish coroner, did not respond to a request for comment Thursday as to whether Eserman, who is married to a detective who worked on the case, should have performed the autopsy and been involved in the case review.
The relationship between the pathologist and the detective should have been disclosed to his family, Bob Arthur contends. He said he was unaware of it until he reviewed the investigative documents.
“Mrs. Eserman should have never been the person leading on the response regarding the new information on the case,” Bob Arthur said. “There is clearly a conflict of interest on her part along with her husband, Sgt. Travis Eserman. There is always a possibility that Mrs. Eserman’s response was written to protect her husband and the other detectives for their shoddy investigation.”
The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, which reopened the investigation into Shawn Arthur’s death after HuffPost started raising questions, did not respond to a request for comment.
Whether the reclassification of Arthur’s death will have any impact on the Jefferson Parish District Attorney’s Office is yet to be seen. A spokesman for the office declined to comment on the case.
Kennedy said he plans to reach out to each of the relevant agencies to raise questions about the reclassification of Arthur’s death.
“We feel strongly that this is a homicide and will be working to provide additional information to the coroner to have that change made,” Kennedy said. “In the meantime, it is our hope the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office will take notice and look more closely at the case, so we can get justice for Shawn.”

Five Ku Klux Klan members were arrested Saturday after stabbing three people in Anaheim, California. They were released late Sunday because they had acted in self-defense, the Anaheim Police Department said in a statement.
The brawl between KKK members and counterprotesters resulted in the arrests of 12 people, police said.
When six Klansmen arrived at the site where the rally was to be held, a group of about 30 counterprotesters had already gathered in anticipation, the APD said in a statement.
They began attacking the KKK members, Sgt. Daron Wyatt of the Anaheim police said. Two KKK members were ""stomped on the ground,"" and Klansmen stabbed three of the counterprotesters. 
The counterprotesters ""were so angry, they would have torn these folks limb from limb,"" Brian Levin, who directs the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, told the Associated Press. ""I was afraid for their lives.""
All three stabbing victims are now in stable condition, according to police.
""Even if the vast majority of our community disagrees with a particular group who visits our city we cannot stop them from lawfully gathering to express their opinions,” Anaheim police Chief Raul Quezada said Sunday. “Violence is not acceptable, and we will arrest anybody who assaults another person or commits any other crime in our city.”
The case now goes to the Orange County District Attorney’s Office for review, where judges will determine whether to file criminal charges.

New Jersey police are accusing a former high school wrestling star of going on a bizarre rampage, trying to hit pedestrians on a boardwalk in a stolen buggy as if he were playing a real life game of ""Grand Theft Auto.""
Lukas Iorio, 20, was arrested Sunday on charges of carjacking, burglary, assault, driving under the influence, resisting arrest, and criminal mischief, according to CBS New York.
Witnesses at the Jersey Shore described Iorio as wild-eyed and berserk as he allegedly began attacking bystanders, CBS reported.
The rampage began after the suspect carjacked an electric buggy driven by the Beach Patrol, Police Chief Elliott A. Correia told NorthJersey.com. 
Iorio allegedly kicked out the windshield of the vehicle, overpowering the two beach officers, before mugging them. He is then accused of taking off down the boardwalk in the vehicle, swerving to hit nearby pedestrians. 
“It’s almost like he was role-playing, in, like, ‘Grand Theft Auto,' with the way he took control of the vehicle -- drove down the beachwalk aiming at people and hitting at least one person, crashing the vehicle,” Correia said.
After crashing the vehicle, police said a man went to check on Iorio, only to be punched in the back of the head by the suspect.
Iorio is accused of fleeing the scene and breaking into a residence. Inside someone else's home, the suspect allegedly repeatedly punched a 72-year-old man in the head and face, according to My Fox NY. The man's family members were able to restrain Iorio until police arrived.
The suspect's father, Tony Iorio, told CBS New York that he was sick to his stomach over the news.
""You know, he's not a criminal; he's a kid who did something really, really stupid,"" Iorio said. “The kid’s never, ever been in trouble before. The kid’s a scholar athlete. He had a 95 average at Bergen Catholic. I don’t know what happened.”

On Thursday, the U.S. attorney for D.C. charged Edgar M. Welch with assault with a dangerous weapon and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime. He initially faced a single federal charge of “interstate transportation of a firearm with intent to commit an offense” on Tuesday. Each charge carries a maximum of 10 years in prison, plus fines.
Welch had originally faced four local firearms-related charges, which prosecutors dropped on Tuesday as they moved to try him in federal court. 
The 28-year-old Welch walked into Comet Ping Pong restaurant on the afternoon of Dec. 4, armed with a loaded AR-15 and a loaded revolver, according to the federal complaint. He fired several shots inside that didn’t hit anyone, investigators said, before leaving and surrendering to police waiting outside.
Welch had been “contemplating a violent confrontation at the restaurant” for three days and tried to recruit at least two other accomplices, an FBI agent said in a sworn statement, citing cell phone records. 
Comet Ping Pong had been the subject of a false conspiracy theory that claimed Clinton and her campaign chair, John Podesta, ran a secret child sex trafficking ring in the back of the restaurant.
James Alefantis, Comet Ping Pong’s owner, told The New York Times in November that he and his employees had received “endless” death threats and other messages over the baseless conspiracy. Authorities believe conspiracy theorists targeted the restaurant after a hack of Podesta’s emails showed that he had corresponded with Alefantis about hosting a fundraiser for Clinton.
Welch reportedly explained his mission in text messages to a friend he allegedly tried to recruit: 
 “Raiding a pedo ring, possibly saraficing [sic] the lives of a few for the lives of many. Standing up against a corrupt system that kidnaps, tortures and rapes babies and children in our own backyard ... The world is too afraid to act and I’m too stubborn not to.”  
Welch already had an arrest record for drug and alcohol offenses, according to the Charlotte Observer. Shortly after his Dec. 4 arrest, he told The New York Times that he made the 350-mile drive to D.C. to get a “closer look” at the restaurant. He said he ultimately regretted how he handled it.

Previously, the union had sought to have the mayor banned from the funerals of police killed in the line of duty.
The union said the request was made because of de Blasio's ""consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve.""
But there hasn't been a mayor, Republican, Democrat or Independent, in at least the recent past who hasn't been met with scorn by the powerful police union.
As former New York Times reporter David Firestone pointed out in a series of tweets: 
At least the last four administrations, spanning nearly 25 years, have faced heavy criticism from the PBA.
For his part, de Blasio has asked that all protests against the killing of unarmed African-American men by police officers be suspended until after the funerals of the slain NYPD officers.
""It’s a time to step back and just focus on these families,"" he said. ""I think it’s a time for everyone to put aside political debates, put aside protests, put aside all of the things that we will talk about in due time. In the coming days, as two families prepare for funerals and figure out how to piece their lives back together, that should be our only concern: How do we support them?""
De Blasio's police commissioner, Bill Braton said the mayor had lost the trust of ""some"" of his officers. Braton's comments came after NYPD officers turned their back on the mayor following a visit to Woodhull Hospital, where the two fallen cops were pronounced dead Saturday.
""I think he has lost it with some officers,"" Bratton said. ""I was at the hospital when that event occurred.... I don't support that particular activity, I don't think it was appropriate, particularly in that setting, but it's reflective of the anger of some of them.""
De Blasio angered the police union after he admitted that he had to train his bi-racial son to be extra careful during interactions with police.
""What parents have done for decades who have children of color, especially young men of color, is train them to be very careful when they have a connection with a police officer,"" de Blasio said. ""It's different for a white child. That's just the reality in this country.""
Previous research has shown that black men are 21 times more likely to be killed by police than their white counterparts.

That patient, it turns out, is William Gray, a reserve officer in Rigby, a city about 15 miles north of Idaho Falls. 
“The Rigby Police Department would like to thank the nurse involved and hospital staff for standing firm, and protecting Officer Gray’s rights as a patient and victim,” the agency said on Facebook. “Protecting the rights of others is truly a heroic act.”
Gray, who is also a truck driver, was badly injured in July when a suspect in a car fleeing police slammed into his truck. The suspect died, and Gray was flown to the University of Utah Burn Center. 
In the hospital, police tried to take blood from Gray, who was not under arrest and not conscious and therefore unable to consent to the blood draw. In addition, police did not have a warrant. 
Wubbels told Payne he could not draw blood under those circumstances and even got other hospital officials on the phone to confirm that policy to the detective. 
She was arrested, and eventually released without being charged. 
Payne is now facing a criminal investigation. Another officer is also on leave as the incident is investigated. 
The Rigby Police Department said it was not aware of the incident surrounding the blood draw until last week.
“It is important to remember that Officer Gray is the victim in this horrible event, and that at no time was he under any suspicion of wrongdoing,” the department said. “As he continues to heal, we would ask that his family be given privacy, respect, and prayers for continued recovery and peace.”

Jeff Piotrowski was broadcasting storm coverage northeast of Dallas Saturday night when he filmed the skirmish, with one shocked Periscope viewer writing: “We almost witnessed your murder.”
The Emmy-award winning chaser was driving outside Farmersville, documenting the destruction, when video shows him passing a man holding his head on the side of the road.
“I’ve got to go back and help that guy. It looked like he was injured,” Piotrowski tells his viewers while turning his vehicle around.
“Are you hurt, are you OK?"" he’s heard repeatedly asking after pulling up to the man.
""I need to speak to an attorney, please,” the man calmly replies off camera. “An attorney!"" he shouts when Piotrowski questions him.
Some kind of tussle ensues in his car before the unidentified man is heard saying, ""This is some bulls—t dude.""
In an interview with the New York Daily News, Piotrowski claims the man lunged into his vehicle from his driver-side window and grabbed his throat. He consequently stepped on the gas, momentarily leaving the suspect hanging onto his truck.
""This guy tried to attack me with a knife!"" he’s next heard screaming in the video.
“He almost got me. Almost stabbed me in the chest,” he says while racing down the road in pursuit of a police officer up ahead.
After pointing an officer in the man’s direction, Piotrowski resumes his course along State Highway 78. Shock then turns to anger.
“Stop to help somebody and they stab you,” he fumes. “In 35 years of chasing, I’ve never had anybody try to freakin’ stab me after a freakin’ tornado. I’m mad as Hell. I wish I had my gun; I woulda shot his ass. This is ridiculous.”
Piotrowski described the man as appearing “wide eyed, like he was wiped out on drugs or something.“
In a message to his fans on Twitter after, he assured them that he was OK though a little banged up.
""I was attacked tonight I'm ok the guy was trying to kill me. I hurt my arms from fighting him off of me. [I'm] glad I'm alive,” he posted. Several hours later he announced that a Collin County Deputy had arrested “the thug” responsible.

The suspect in this Louisiana case, Felix Vail, is a mysterious figure who's been under scrutiny for other possible crimes. He had a girlfriend who disappeared in 1973 and a second wife who hasn't been seen since 1984.
Investigative journalist Jerry Mitchell of the Jackson Clarion Ledger, who's written a series of articles and a book about Vail, said ""his is the oldest possible serial killer case in U.S. history.""
Mary Horton Vail died on Oct. 28, 1962. Her husband said she fell overboard into the Calcasieu River, near Lake Charles, La. and authorities deemed it an accident at the time, KATC said. 
But Vail had taken out a life insurance policy on his wife two months earlier and the autopsy contained details undermining his assertion that she fell. There was a 4-inch bruise on the back of her neck and a scarf was shoved 4 inches into her mouth. 
Mitchell's reporting spotlights other inconsistencies in Vail's version of events.
Calcasieu Parish Coroner Dr. Terry Welke revised the decades-old determination and said she died before her body hit the water. The Calcasieu Parish District Attorney John DeRosier charged Vail with second-degree murder, which would lead to a life sentence if convicted. 
“All we wanted from the beginning was justice, and now we feel we’re getting justice,” said Will Horton, Mary's brother. “We’re going through due process that we should have gone through 51 years ago.”
After Mary's death, his girlfriend Sharon Hensley disappeared in 1973. Vail told her family that he saw her for the last time in Key West boarding a boat with an Australian couple for a trip around the world, KPLC said.
Vail concocted a similar story to the mother of his second wife Annette Craver. Vail was 40 when he met Craver in the early 1980s and she was 15. Her mother Mary Rose claimed that Vail took control of $100,000 that her daughter inherited when her father died and coerced her into signing over the deed to a home in Tulsa, Okla. 
Vail told authorities he saw Craver for the last time in September 1984 when she boarded a bus for Mexico, but Craver's family said the couple was together at least a month after that. 
A hearing on Aug. 14 will decide if Vail is eligible for a public defender, the Sulphur Daily News said.

Rider Gregory Locke had just boarded a train in Manhattan Saturday night when he said he found himself face-to-face with the crudely vandalized windows and advertisements.
“The train was silent as everyone stared at each other, uncomfortable and unsure what to do,” he wrote in a Facebook post. “One guy got up and said, ‘Hand sanitizer gets rid of Sharpie. We need alcohol.’ He found some tissues and got to work.”
The man’s actions sparked a ripple effect among the other riders who Locke said got up to help wipe away the graffiti.
“I’ve never seen so many people simultaneously reach into their bags and pockets looking for tissues and [Purell]. Within about two minutes, all the Nazi symbolism was gone,” Locke wrote.
Speaking to ABC 7 News, Locke said the actions of his fellow riders left him encouraged.
“Seeing a bunch of strangers stand up for, and come together to stand up for what everyone knows is right, was very heartening,” he told the local station.
“I guess this is Trump’s America,” Locke recalled hearing one passenger say.
“No sir, it’s not,” he responded in his Facebook post. “Not tonight and not ever. Not as long as stubborn New Yorkers have anything to say about it.”
Locke’s post as of Sunday morning has been shared more than 300,000 times.
Chelsea Clinton was among those who shared it to her Twitter followers, adding: “We will not let hate win. And, another reason to carry hand sanitizer.”
In a separate incident, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday shared a photo of similar graffiti that had been drawn in the center of a northbound B train’s American flag.
The markings showed a swastika that had been boxed in, turning it into four squares that were inscribed with “L-O-V-E.”
“This is what New Yorkers do, we turn hate into love,” Cuomo said in statement. “That is our message to the nation and to the world. And we won’t back down. Not now, not ever.”

47,CRIME,Documentary Star Fights Molestation Conviction,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jesse-friedman-capturing-the-friedmans_n_6090856.html,,2014-11-02,CRIME,"By Ellen Wulfhorst
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jesse Friedman, whose conviction as a teenage child molester was portrayed in the Oscar-nominated film ""Capturing the Friedmans,"" is not giving up his decades-long campaign to clear his name.
Friedman has asked a court to review evidence in his case, one of the most notorious in the history of New York's Long Island, contending that prosecutors coached and intimidated child witnesses into making false allegations. A judge could issue a ruling on his request any day now.
Friedman also alleges that prosecutors defamed him after a more recent reinvestigation of the case, and a lawsuit he filed is winding its way through the courts.
Friedman was 18 when he pleaded guilty to molesting more than a dozen boys in the 1980s at computer classes taught by his father in the basement of their home in suburban Great Neck.
The documentary on the Friedmans pieced together intimate home videos and revealing interviews, and raised questions about the police work and prosecution tactics.
Now 45, Friedman wants exoneration even though his prison sentence is behind him. Having completed parole, he is a married man who has found work as an online bookseller.
""I haven't gotten to the end yet,"" he said in a recent interview at his Bridgeport, Connecticut home. ""I could just say, 'It's time to move on,' but I don't and I'm not going to because justice for justice's sake, truth for truth's sake. It's still important.""
Controversy always surrounded the Friedman case, from the sensational details at its start to the doubts about its veracity that linger today.
The saga began in 1987 when Jesse's father Arnold was caught ordering child pornography. The investigation led to hundreds of charges of child molestation against father and son.
Arnold Friedman, an admitted pedophile, pleaded guilty and went to prison, where he killed himself in 1995.
Jesse Friedman served 13 years in prison and was released in 2001. 
NATIONAL ATTENTION
The case gained national attention in 2003 when ""Capturing the Friedmans"" was nominated for an Academy Award.
Today Friedman, thin and balding, lives quietly with his wife Lisabeth, two dogs and two cats and tries to stay out of the public eye that peered so intimately into his life.
""I'm a 45-year-old guy who sells books and goes to the grocery store like everyone else, and that's important to me,"" he said. ""I strenuously protect what privacy that I have.""
Despite Friedman's efforts at normalcy, his exoneration fight means a stream of legal filings and meetings with lawyers. His designation for life as a Level 3 violent sex offender restricts where he can work, live, worship and travel. Raising a family would be nearly impossible, making everyday events like taking a child to school problematic.
Friedman has an encyclopedic knowledge of wrongful convictions and false confession cases, many of which made headlines in the late 1980s such as the McMartin preschool case in California and the Kelly Michaels case in New Jersey.
Many unraveled or were discredited over prosecutors' questionable use of suggestive interviewing techniques, hypnosis and what is known in psychotherapy as repressed and recovered memories of abuse.
Friedman, facing 243 charges in 1988, has said he pleaded guilty to 25 counts, convinced after dire warnings from the presiding judge about the penalties he faced, that he could not get a fair trial in the intensely publicized case.
A federal appeals court in 2010 said there was a ""reasonable likelihood"" he had been wrongfully convicted but said it could not overturn his conviction due to legal technicalities.
The ruling strongly criticized the judge, prosecutors and police and suggested the case be reviewed.
It also raised Friedman's hopes of clearing his name. 
REPORT DISPUTED
But Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice declared three years later that a reinvestigation of the case ""has only increased confidence in the integrity of Jesse Friedman's guilty plea.""
Her report cited victims who affirmed their accounts, disputed recantations and blasted ""Capturing the Friedmans"" as ""selectively edited and misleading.""
""Instances of wrongful conviction are real and exist in far greater numbers than any of us would like to admit,"" Rice wrote. ""But the case against Jesse Friedman is not one of them.
""We were fully prepared to exonerate Mr. Friedman if that's where the facts led us. But the facts, under any objective analysis, led to a substantially different conclusion,"" she wrote.
Stung by the Rice report, which called him a psychopath, Friedman filed his defamation suit against the prosecutor.
Rice spokesman Paul Leonard said she was prepared to defend against it.
""We view this lawsuit as meritless and will defend zealously against its allegations,"" Leonard said.
Friedman's team of advocates, which includes ""Capturing the Friedmans"" director Andrew Jarecki, has collected recantations, eyewitnesses who say they saw nothing amiss and accusers who now say their incriminating statements were pressured and coached. They say the Rice report was biased and woefully incomplete.
In a reel of new evidence compiled by Jarecki, one accuser, now an adult, said he was never raped or sodomized. ""If I said it, it was not because it happened. It was because someone else put those words in my mouth,"" he said.
Another advocate for reopening the case is Arline Epstein, whose young son made accusations against the Friedmans. Two years ago, as an adult, he admitted he had lied to end what he found to be relentless pressure.
He told his mother that police questioning him as a child warned if he didn't say he was abused he could become a homosexual.
""The degree of the wrong is so appalling and so shocking that this just has to be addressed,"" Epstein said. ""If we don't, then the whole credibility of our system crumbles.""
Friedman's defenders want all the evidence reviewed in a hearing seeking to overturn his conviction. The hearing has been assigned to a Nassau County judge but not scheduled.

Whether we're making up for an all-nighter or just catching up on snoozing during our free time, napping is a common college activity across the nation.
It's easy to feel lazy as you crawl into your bed for a nap when you could be finishing up homework or getting ahead on reading for class, but a study recently proved that a 30-minute nap can actually reverse the hormonal impact that comes from a night of poor sleep.
If you still haven't mastered the art of time management or you spent the night cramming for your exam, schedule in that short power nap because it is worth it. 
If you've found yourself buried in books until the early hours, know that you're not alone. The study also found that nearly 10 adults reported that they slept six hours or less per night, clearly missing out on the benefits that can be reaped from sleeping for the recommended eight hours of sleep.
Powering through with no sleep can be hard, so make sure to carve time out of your schedule for some quick yet serious rest. Power naps have also shows to help relieve stress and improve the immune systems. While this data comes from men who only slept two hours the previous night, it was made clear that power naps can truly turn things around. Even if you feel like you're overwhelmed with work, if you're running low on sleep, skip out on resorting to caffeine and allow yourself to fit a 30-minute nap into your schedule. 
Everything we do in our daily routine can be pointed back towards our sleep patterns, so cramming in the power nap is just as important as cramming in the studying the night before.
Here's how to prepare for the perfect power nap:
1. Before you crawl into bed, make a short to-do list so you don't wake up feeling stressed. While it's important to make time for some rest and rejuvenation, it's a terrible feeling to wake up feeling unproductive and cloudy. Making a to-do list will make you feel structured and organized when you're ready to get going again. 2. When you're thinking about location for your nap, make sure you're somewhere where you won't be woken up. Aim for your bed instead of the couch of your living room or the love seat by the TV, because nothing is worse than an interrupted power nap. If you're in the room with you're door shut, you're bound to actually fall asleep without interruption. 3. Limit your distractions. Don't crawl into bed with your iPad or phone in hand because technological distractions will prevent you from falling asleep quickly. The bright screen will keep your mind and eyes awake longer, and that means less time for that well-deserved shuteye. 4. Even if you think you're just going to close your eyes for a few minutes, make sure you set an alarm so your 30-minute nap doesn't accidentally turn into a 3-hour snooze fest. 5. Be sure to make the room dark and quiet. You don't have much time to catch up on your Z's, so make sure you've created the ideal environment for your nap. 
Next time you take your power nap, remember these tips and snooze away! Trust me, the health benefits totally make it worth it.

We need to write to our legislators to remind them of the original intent of ESEA and the need to ensure that our students get a world-class education that allows them to become contributing members of society.,2015-03-04,EDUCATION,"The single most important issue facing the 114th Congress is the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), a law whose primary purpose when it was originally passed was to alleviate the conditions of poverty that often cripple the ability of educators to meet our professional commitments and crush the hopes of the children we serve.
At its recent AFL-CIO Executive Council meeting, a statement titled Restore the Promise of ESEA was introduced and passed asking Congress to reclaim the true spirit of ESEA -- a law signed by then President Lyndon Baines Johnson as a way to alleviate poverty by providing adequate resources to disadvantaged and special needs children, thereby helping them to better compete.
The AFL CIO statement further calls on Congress to invest in the things frontline educators know our students need to secure a high quality education, rather than perpetuating the mandates and evaluation schemes promoted under No Child Left Behind (NCLB) that have so patently failed.
Indeed recalling the intent of ESEA only highlights the flaws in the first draft of the legislation, Student Success Act, soon to be debated in the House of Representatives. The draft continues to weigh heavily on testing and keeping funding at sequestration levels, making it difficult, if not impossible, to provide services and resources in areas where child poverty is at an all-time high.
In fact, a report released recently by the White House found that the bill would cap spending for the next six years at $800 million lower than it was in 2012. 
During the public response phase of HR 5, my union, the American Federation of School Administrators (AFSA), made suggestions of ways to improve the act. In coalition with the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) and the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP), we submitted recommendations calling for inclusion of school leaders in the development of evaluation plans and more professional development and training. In addition, our coalition challenged performance assessments currently in use. 
A joint statement we submitted to Congress noted that ""assessments that are attached to high-stakes and a punitive label regardless of whether or not a student is actually making academic gains and growth is counterproductive. This has led to an untenable environment of over-testing, and [has] forced educators to spend less time on instruction in order to prepare for standardized tests.""
To address these inequities, we urged that states and districts use more expansive growth models instead of high-stakes assessments in the belief that such an expansion of assessment systems would put more balance, fairness, and accuracy in measuring student and school progress and performance. The AFL CIO's Executive Council statement strongly endorsed this approach by, among other things, calling for an end to the federal mandate on teacher and principal evaluations.
Dr. Christine Handy, principal at Gaithersburg High School in Gaithersburg, Maryland, made a more viable path to success apparent in her testimony before the Senate Health Education Labor Pension (HELP) Committee when she stated, ""ESEA must acknowledge the vital role of principals and provide them with appropriate professional support to ensure high academic achievement for all students.""
Congress has the opportunity to invest in our nation's most valuable resource -- our youth. We need to write to our legislators to remind them of the original intent of ESEA and the need to ensure that our students get a world-class education that allows them to become contributing members of society.

By Will Kane, Common Sense News
Newfound confidence and feelings of safety. Concern about bullying. Changes in education. A worrying rise in legal questions about domestic violence and immigration. President Trump’s first 100 days in office have meant a variety of things to children, families and the people who care about them across the country.
Common Sense News spoke to children, parents, grandparents, teachers, lawyers and child advocates across the country to better understand what President Trump’s first months in office have meant to them. The conversations paint a complicated picture of a country trying to understand the Trump presidency. 
‘After Trump, I got my voice.’
At 6-feet-3 inches, Reece Sherrill is tall for a 14-year-old. He’s on his Indiana middle school’s basketball team but has found himself, he says, sitting on the bench more than he would like. He contemplated transferring schools and finding a new coach until he watched Trump on the national stage. 
“I liked his personality, he really gets to the point with stuff,” Reece said of Trump. So Reece, whose parents are lifelong Republicans, asked himself what Trump would do in his situation. He decided to talk with his coach. 
“I was just like, ‘Is there anyway I could get my minutes, I’ve been playing my butt off,” Reece said. To his surprise, Reece’s coach responded well and he ended up playing more. 
The moment was a turning point for Reece, who found that by emulating some of Trump’s candor, he found a new of way interacting with the world. 
“I wouldn’t have said that before,” Reece said. “I feel like I would have just held back and kept everything in. I would have gotten sad or mad.”
“After Trump, I got my voice a little bit,” he added. “I say what I mean.”
A teacher tunes in, soothes fears
The day after the election, Sarah La Due, a 7th grade English teacher in El Cerrito, Calif., felt like she had let her diverse classroom of students down. “I felt like as adult we had betrayed for them the world we told them they were living in,” she said.
But since then, the teacher has doubled-down on her efforts to create an inclusive, sympathetic and informed classroom. Her school, Korematsu Middle, was recently named one of the most diverse in the San Francisco Bay Area.
La Due has made a point of never asking her students about their immigration status, although she knows the issue concerns any of her students. A fellow teacher learned a student’s father had been deported the morning before she came to school. 
“I am more in tune to listening to their conversations, especially about deportation or immigrants,” La Due said. “A lot of times they make jokes about it. They use humor to cover up anxiety or fear.”
In response, La Due and her colleagues have been handing out cards from the ACLU that give advice in English and Spanish on how to speak with immigration agents. 
La Due has also focused on current events, with special units on spotting fake news and bias. 
“We did a lesson on pizza gate,” she said, referencing a popular conspiracy theory involving Hillary’s Clinton’s campaign and a pizza restaurant. “We’ve analyzed MSNBC news clips and Fox News clips and talked about how we saw bias.”
A deeper understanding of religion and identity 
In Houston, Trump’s presidency has been unsettling for Saadia Faruqi, her husband and two children. The Muslim family has long felt welcome in Houston, which has one of the largest Pakistani populations in the country. But increasingly there have been flashes of hostility, especially at school with her 10-year-old son, Mubashir.
“Somebody said to my son, ‘You’re going to be kicked out,’” she said. “He very calmly turned around to the guy and said, ‘You’re so dumb. I am an American citizen, I won’t be kicked out.’” 
Mubashir, who has been the victim of bullying even before Trump became President, has found new friendships with his classmates from Latin America in the last few months. “All of his friends are suddenly Hispanic,” Faruqi said. “I asked him why and he told me, ‘People hate Muslims and Mexicans, so I figured we have to stay together.”
Bullying has increased, even as “teachers don’t take it seriously,” Faruqi said. Other students “call my son a terrorist and I complain to the teachers and they laugh and say the kids don’t watch TV. I feel it is more blatant now. ”
Faruqi, a writer, said she has felt the animosity herself when she’s out at the supermarket or running errands. 
“I feel like people are more able to say things that they maybe would not have said before,” she said.
But, Faruqi said, “I have also had people who have been acting more friendly than they would have before.”
And Mubashir has found a deeper appreciation for his religion. 
“I have seen that he is more willing to speak out about Muslims about Islam,” Faruqi said. “The other day, a friend asked why he wasn’t eating pork and he said that’s what the Koran said. I was proud of him. At his age he doesn’t want to have a religious conversation. Every word is ‘whatever.’” 
A threat to education
For Diane Ravitch, one of the leading advocates of traditional public education, President Trump’s first 100 days in office have been bleak. 
“I think the most important thing he has done is appoint a secretary of education who is not a fan of public schools,” Ravitch said, referring to Betsy DeVos, a Michigan philanthropist who has no teaching experience and never attended public school. “I think she represents a very serious threat to public education.”
Ravitch, a former assistant secretary of education under President George H.W. Bush, said she worried Trump’s plan to let parents choose their child’s school could permanently undermine funding for public schools. 
“I think that this could be very serious for the future of public education, pretty ominous.”
But not all the developments are distressing: DeVos’ confirmation hearing “became the fodder for late-night talk shows,” Ravitch said, generating new interest in public schools.
Membership in Ravitch’s Network for Public Education, a public school advocacy group, has surged from 22,000 members in September to 350,000 members today. 
“People who never knew there was a secretary of education are now interested in the public education,” she said. “People became very aware because she is a lightning rod.”
In this Chicago home, a break from the news
Sonya Strenge, 36, had prepared what she would say to her 3-year-old daughter when Hillary Clinton won the election. But when she realized Trump would win, she turned off the news. 
“I’ve never turned it back on,” she said. “My husband and I have kind of decided to shield her from this.”
Strenge and her husband occasionally watch topical comedians like Samantha Bee and Seth Meyers after their daughter Linnea goes to bed, but have otherwise avoided the news, which used to be a big part of their evening routine. 
“Our media consumption has definitely changed,” she said. “We are very selective of what we want her to be consuming and very selective of what we watch in front of her.”
As Linnea gets older, Strenge thinks she’ll introduce more details about policy, activism and voting. But for now, Strenge wants her to focus on being a child.
“She’ll be in elementary school in two years, I am sure they are going to talk about the President,” Strenge said. “I don’t want to blind her and say, ‘We don’t have a President, honey.’”
New worry about police, violence
Like any grandma, Nadida Matin, 50, worries about her grandchildren. As a black, Muslim woman living in St. Louis she’s acutely aware of the threats she and her family can face from the government. 
Her step-son, Abdul Kamal, was killed by police in New Jersey in 2013 and Trump’s support for police and lack of interest in reform makes her feel at risk. Kamal was unarmed, and was shot after he refused to take his hands out of his pockets, a New Jersey newspaper reported. Police called the shooting justified.
“Being a Muslim and having (Trump) say he is a law-and-order candidate, and having a step-son murdered by the police makes that even more concerning,” she said. 
Matin is raising three of her grandchildren, ages 8, 10 and 11, and has made a point to talk to them about how to interact with the police.
“I tell them not to be fearful, to be engaged and know your own presence and strength; don’t be disrespectful,” she said. “We don’t allow them to go to the park unless we’re present. Stay in safe places. Don’t do things that would have people look at you as something other than your authentic self.” 
But Matin, a lifelong activist, has also found that Trump’s presidency has revealed hard truths about race in America. 
“Trump, he brought those thing to light that most people don’t want to talk about,” she said. “His being elected just made us have those conversations that we struggle with. He took away our ability to be ignorant to what’s going on. You no longer have the luxury to sit on the side lines.”
Feelings of safety in small-town Indiana
Rachel Kidd, 14, plays tennis and is on the cheerleading squad at her middle school in Bedford, Indiana, a town of 13,000 people. She wants to become a marine biologist or practice art.
But Kidd also worries about what she sees in the news: the threat of terrorism, ISIS and rising extremism. And so far she’s been very pleased with Trump’s aggressive approach to those issues.
""With us being in small town, I know we’re not directly involved in that stuff,” she said, referring to the threats of terrorism often felt in large cities like New York, Paris or London. “But what he’s doing makes us feel safer.”
“One thing that President Trump was really big on was protecting America and America First, and he stayed true for that; he has not let refugees in so far,” she said. 
Kidd knows some people are threatened and hurt by Trump’s immigration policies, but she feels those stories are overplayed by the media. 
“I hope that he continues to keep our country safe and stops many of the terrorist groups and the terrorist attacks,” she said.
A choice for parents when it comes to school?
For years, Neal McCluskey, an education scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, has argued that parents should be able to take their child out of a failing public school and put them in a charter or private school of their choice. If schools compete, he argues, children win.
Donald Trump might make that a real thing. 
Trump has said he supports school choice, and DeVos, his secretary of education, has long supported the policy. Neither have proposed detailed policy proposals. 
But as much as he supports reforming the traditional public school system, McCluskey hopes Trump and DeVos will let states and local communities find their own way to the policy. 
“I am pleased with the administration’s at least rhetorical move away from federal control of education, including Secretary DeVos stating multiple times in her confirmation hearing that education decisions are properly made at the state, local, or family level, not in Washington,” McCluskey said in an e-mail. 
A strict reading of the Constitution gives the federal government little authority over local schools, he said. 
“If the federal government tries to bribe or otherwise incentivize states to adopt choice programs we run a huge risk of the feds eventually regulating all private schools, rendering choice largely meaningless,” he said.
In Los Angeles, new interest in immigration rules 
Jimena Vasquez is a family law attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. In the last few months she’s seen a spike in the number of immigrant single mothers asking for help getting a passport for their citizen children without permission from the child’s father. 
In many cases, Vasquez said, the men have been abusive and the mothers want to know how they can get a passport without the permission of their child’s father, which the State Department usually requires. 
If an immigrant parent is deported, a passport will give their child an easy way to return to America when they grow older. 
“I think among immigrants it is a valid concern of immigration enforcement,” Vasquez said. “If people are going to leave, they want to leave with their child. It is easier to get a passport here than it is there.”
The State Department is usually cooperative, Vasquez said, but the process can require unfamiliar and burdensome paperwork. 
A renaissance of interest in local education
When Amanda Litman, a former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer, started Run for Something to encourage progressive millennials to run for local office, she hoped 100 people would sign up. Three months into Trump’s presidency, 9,000 have, and nearly a quarter have expressed interest in running for their local school board. 
“I think folks are seeing that elections have consequences, especially for our kids,” she said. 
That includes people like Shae Ashe, 27, who told NPR he decided to run for school board in his Pennsylvania town because “what happens on the local level is affecting your daily life.""

51,EDUCATION,A Hack for Improving High School: Combine it With College and Career,"GenDIY, ContributorGenDIY",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-hack-for-improving-high_b_9439848.html,,2016-03-12,EDUCATION,"Joel Vargas & Hannah Smith, Jobs for the Future
Hack: a clever solution to a tricky problem
There is good news and bad news about today's high school students. The good news is that more students are finishing high school. Graduation rates have increased over four years to a high of 82 percent in the 2013-14 school year. And as college credentials have increasingly become a necessity for getting onto a career path with good wages, high school graduates get the message. Aside from a few dips during economic recessions, the percentage of high school graduates who go onto college has trended up over several decades. 
The bad news is that while many students take the step to start at a two-year or four-year college, too many stumble before finishing. Of those who go to college, a large number--and a disproportionate share from low-income families start in remedial courses and fail to ever advance into college-level work. 
This is not about students' lack of motivation or merit. The problem is that high schools are not preparing them for an economy that demands workers with more education, skills, and knowledge. Policymakers have largely tried to fix this by strengthening standards, curricula, and assessments to align what is learned within schools to what colleges and employers expect graduates to know. These are foundational efforts that should lead to large-scale improvements over time.
But we can also strengthen high schools now, borrowing lessons from innovative educators and students who have found an interesting hack for improving college and career outcomes. They are blending the high school experience with college and career, removing walls and boundaries between compulsory schooling and the next steps in learning and work.
Early college high schools, for example, use a blended approach and have produced incredible results. Early college students receive support to complete up to two years of college credit and earn an associate's degree as part of the high school curriculum. There are over 280 such schools around the country serving largely low-income and first generation college students, and many of the schools are located on college campuses. Rigorous research shows that early college schools ensure that more students finish high school and start and complete college credentials, including the roughly 30 percent who finish an associate's degree along with their high school diploma.
One of the reasons that early college works so well is that through the introduction to the postsecondary system, students have a structured, safe, and sanctioned testing ground to explore their limits. Developmentally, the time during and following high school can be fraught with uncertainty about one's path and identity. Through an early college experience, students are given the support and license they need to experiment, develop, and practice the academic habits and social norms that are integral to success in college (e.g., study skills, ability to manage one's own learning, knowing how and when to seek help from adults, navigating the financial aid system). The schools create an environment of exposure, exploration, academic rigor, and authentic rehearsal for a possible future self.
The same logic applies to schools trying a similar but different blending of college, career, and high school. In Linked Learning, high school students engage in work-based learning and take sequences of career and technical courses that prepare students for college and career, including college-level courses. Exposure here is also a key to student success. In addition to opportunities to take college courses, students in these high quality pathways are given the chance to apply what they learn in school and deepen academic and workplace skills in real-life work situations through internships, job shadows, and other work-based learning experiences.
The Wonderful Company is supporting and promoting practices consistent with early college and Linked Learning in the Central Valley of California. Several schools have created pathways in agricultural business management, plant science, and mechanics--all preparing students for four-year colleges while enabling them to complete an associate's degree by high school graduation or within one term after graduation. The schools are young, but the largely Latino, first-generation students that they serve are already showing early signs of strengthened academic achievement: at Wonderful College Prep Academy students are averaging two years of academic growth in one school year in English and math. The immersive experiences with college and career make the relevance of high school learning more evident to students and the rigor and ownership of what they learn are strengthened. As one of the school's students says,  ""This is a way different experience... Now I study about four to five hours a day for my high school and college classes.""
Turning to a more mature example, since 2004 Texas has supported the creation of 154 early college high schools throughout the state. One of the more notable efforts is in El Paso on the Mexican border where since 2009, over 1,100 early college graduates with associate's degrees have entered the University of Texas El Paso (UTEP) as college juniors. There are so many students accelerating to bachelor's degrees that UTEP has created special intake process and other support systems to pave the way for these young students toward future success. The early college high schools, El Paso Community College, and UTEP have clearly created a more supported, successful set of transitions for the community's young people. One student nearing graduation says, 
""...high school is a home base, and they helped me figure stuff out but also to take charge of myself. The first time, they helped us register for college classes, but after that it was, 'ok, it's how they do at college. You can do it yourself.'"" (From forthcoming report by Nancy Hoffman of JFF.)
Schools that blend college and career with high school education offer youth the chance to take ownership over their life by creating conditions that are favorable to exposure and exploration, while simultaneously offering the academic rigor, supports, and guidance necessary to make informed decisions. It is time we acknowledged that preparation for life after high school cannot happen exclusively inside the walls of high school. Exposure and experience are crucial to ensuring the appropriate type of preparation, and the timing couldn't be better for reforming the way our young people learn about themselves and shape their futures.

52,EDUCATION,"If Life Is a Game, What Are the Rules?","Stuart Muszynski, ContributorFounder and CEO, PurpleAmerica.us",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/if-life-is-a-game-what-ar_b_6199132.html,"The students who make up the poverty and homeless statistics that some suburbanites look at dispassionately, shaking their heads while proclaiming, ""Not in America!"" -- these kids want to succeed.",2014-11-21,EDUCATION,"A new report from the National Center on Family Homelessness indicates that 1 in 30 American children were homeless last year. That's a staggering figure that all Americans ought to be thrown by because it speaks to the dysfunction of our economic recovery as well as the lapses in the American Dream. It also speaks to a fact of urban life in America: that Americans living in poverty don't know the ""rules of the game.""
I discovered this several years ago through my work in delivering Project Love character-education and social-emotional learning programs in the Cleveland Public Schools (now the Cleveland Metropolitan School District). Following a Power of Kindness workshop, a Cleveland student asked to speak to me, profoundly pointing out that, ""If life is a game, then I don't know the rules.""
After another workshop, Keith, a white former gang member, volunteered to lead students in future sessions. I asked him why, given his background, he wanted to take the time to train other teens through the power of kindness. He responded, ""Until now, I didn't know there was another way.""
In Believe to Achieve, Project Love's intensive weekly programming for the most at-risk students in the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, facilitators start out with ninth-graders by discussing their life purpose. Figure that teens aren't interested? Guess again. 
The students who make up the poverty and homeless statistics that some suburbanites look at dispassionately, shaking their heads while proclaiming, ""Not in America!"" -- these kids want to succeed. But they first need to believe in themselves, and in their life purpose, hopes and dreams. Then they need to understand how to choose a mentor, ask for help, and build relationships. Then they need to graduate high school, learn workplace behaviors, get a job, go to college, or do both. Rules of the Game.
By following this formula, and connecting at-risk students with love -- a loving person who encourages them -- 85 percent of Believe to Achieve students, originally pegged as potential ninth grade dropouts, graduated from high school. Many became their school's top academic achievers.
But even after that, once they know the rules, they need to make a pact with their friends and mentors that they will succeed at the ""game of life."" They need social and emotional supports in order to ""win"" the game.
In the 2002 best-selling book The Pact, three friends who went through the Newark, New Jersey schools made a success pact, seeing each other through the trials, tribulations and dysfunctions of urban life and academic striving. They describe the continuing lure of the streets toward crime, drugs and decay and how their pact boosted each of them to success as doctors and a dentist. They found mentors, supported each other and learned ""the rules of the game.""
The statistics are indeed shameful -- homelessness, violence, poverty, hunger, dropping out -- and they accurately represent the cycle of poverty in Cleveland and elsewhere in urban and rural America. But the real shame is not the fault of these kids -- it's the fault of our education system for not teaching students the rules.
This will get worse. With the advent of Common Core standards and other stringent measures, this kind of social-emotional education will become more problematic for principals (whose schools are under a microscope) who opt for hard academics over soft skills. They're wrong. In order to win at the game of life, we need both. Just ask CEOs which skills lead to greater success and they will tell you that social-emotional competencies and character will result in greater success in the workplace and life.
The ""rules of the game"" are pretty simple but, in our current negative media world, without intervention, they're easily missed. However, if you get kids together to define them, their values shine through. Two weeks ago, Project Love assembled 2,000 teens at its annual Kickoff for Kindness rally at Cleveland State University to define these rules. As they tweeted ideas in response to compelling speakers, #rulesofthegame became the fourth most trending tweet of the day. Here are some of them:
Every teen can change the world. No matter what, keep your head up and stay strong. Don't be afraid to stand up! Everyone has a purpose. Do not end your life. Treat everyone equally. Stop the Hate! Give back and make a difference. Madison Wagner 8th grader challenges teens: have COURAGE! Do the right thing. Learn to Love and Love to Learn. Confront the haters. Be an example for others to follow. Be a role model. Treat people how you want to be treated. Character is who you are! Don't judge a book by its cover. Be respectful, be responsible, and be productive. Help the other people, even if you don't know them. Be authentic. Try not to give up on people or your friends. Speak up for those with no voice. One rule? Always be positive, it could rub off on someone. Don't take someone's kindness for weakness. Be a team player. Don't quit; you have one more move. Make your dream become reality. Stop sippin' on that HATErade. Be great. Don't let your pride stop you from speaking out. Change the cycle of your generation. Don't make excuses. It doesn't matter how you start -- it's where you finish. Love yourself and love others. Talk it out before throwing hands. Never allow yourself to be in a messed up situation. Stay true to yourself. Always spread your kindness to others. If u can't say anything nice don't say anything at all. Be nice to everyone, just by smiling at someone can make someone's day. Don't let anyone tell you who you are. Be courageous, be brave and be different. Make it your goal to make someone smile each and every day. Life doesn't give u a roadmap to happiness; in order to be truly happy u have to value yourself and the other people around u. Surround yourself with positive influences. Fill your heart with what's important and be done with the rest. Be a lover, not a fighter. Kindness is the key to success.
One of my closest friends, whose parents hid my parents during the Holocaust, once said to me: ""There are many angels and many devils, but you can choose whether you see the angels or see the devils."" I see many angels in these teens, and I have great hope that the ""rules of the game"" will empower kids to believe in themselves, repair our world, and fix the cycles of poverty, violence and negativity that plague America. We just need to give them the tools and our encouragement, and let them lead.

53,EDUCATION,Swearing an Oath -- Part 1,"Frank Breslin, ContributorRetired high-school teacher",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/swearing-an-oath----part_b_9123966.html,"Since taking their oath, many governors have begun to close public schools.  By violating their oath in so public a manner, they have shown that perjuring themselves means nothing to them, as does the fact that their first act in office was an act of perjury.",2016-01-31,EDUCATION,"There is a wondrous scene in Robert Bolt's play, A Man for All Seasons, when Thomas More is talking to his daughter as she tries to convince him to take the Oath of Supremacy to avoid execution by Henry VIII. He could simply take the oath, she suggests, without really believing in what he'd be saying, be released from the Tower, and return to his family. 
Sir Thomas, however, gently chides his daughter about why he cannot do this: that taking an oath is solemnly and publicly to call upon God to witness that what one is saying one truly believes in one's heart. Not believing it would be calling upon God to witness a lie, a most grievous wrong, a wrong he would not wish his daughter to think her father capable of. 
For in swearing an oath, he continues, one is proclaiming before God and the world that what one is saying is true, and that were he to lie, even though he'd be saving his life, he'd be losing his honor, his soul, and himself -- forever. Truly, a man for all seasons!  ***
Likewise, in taking his oath of office, a state governor is also solemnly and publicly calling upon God to witness that what he is saying, he intends to perform. He is swearing, in essence, that he will do all in his power to preserve, protect, and defend all the institutions and responsibilities of state government, including those of public education -- ""so help me God."" 
And, likewise, if he were lying and had no intention of carrying out those duties, he would also be calling upon God to witness a lie, a most grievous wrong, have lost his honor, his integrity, his very essence -- forever.
He would also be perjuring himself, and even, perhaps, be sentenced to prison. 
It is a fearful thing to swear such an oath and not intend to protect what one has sworn to protect, but even worse would it be to destroy it. By perjuring oneself, one would have revealed oneself before all the world to be morally unfit for such an office of high public trust. 
And, in a previous age, it was always thought dangerous to keep such a man in power, since in lying to God he would think nothing of lying to anyone, and there was no telling what such a man might do were he allowed to continue in power. ***
Since taking their oath, many governors have begun to close public schools. By violating their oath in so public a manner, they have shown that perjuring themselves means nothing to them, as does the fact that their first act in office was an act of perjury. 
The possibility that anyone will ever trust them again seems doubtful since everyone knows that a perjurer now resides in the governor's mansion. What happens to governors who perjure themselves naturally depends on the citizens of their states.
Until then, the question is why these governors who swore to protect public schools chose not only not to protect them, but also to destroy them. 
I'd like to discuss two possibilities. First, let's suppose that before taking their oath, these governors were all true believers in public education, and that only afterwards did they undergo a soul-changing ""Damascus experience,"" whereby they realized that the only way of saving these schools was by destroying them, as the saying went during the Vietnam era that ""the only way of saving a town was destroying it."" ***
The mystery is how to explain that all of these governors reacted in the very same way. How did these true believers in public schools suddenly become their fiercest opponents, so fierce, in fact, that far from trying to improve these schools, they replaced them with charters? 
What prompted these governors, now securely in power, to suddenly become so disenchanted with public schools that they're now closing them all over the country? 
How do they reconcile this with their oath, or do they simply refuse to face what they've done?
How did these educational neophytes all suddenly ""see the light"" at the same time? How did they discover that public schools were so beyond the pale of redemption that they had to be closed? 
Was this mass conversion to charters pure coincidence or the brainchild of the charter school industry itself, whose vision of a better world convinced these governors to rid America of its public schools, as the words of their oath were still ringing in their ears?  ***
How did all of these governors become suddenly conversant with educational research which so overwhelmingly convinced them that public schools must be abolished? 
Did it cross their minds that this newfound ""research"" might be nothing but a tissue of false accusations concocted by the same charter industry to undermine America's trust in its public schools to make way for charters?
Or that this was nothing but a hostile and highly financed corporate takeover being sold as educational ""reform""? 
Did these governors realize that no such ""research"" even existed?
 ***
What prompted their decision, contrary to their oath, to close these public schools rather than work to improve them as is the normal way of addressing such problems?   Was this option even considered, and, if so, why was it rejected in favor of charters, apart from their prospect of unlimited profits to potential investors?
Since tens of billions of dollars could yearly be diverted to charters from closed and already weakened public schools, why didn't these governors avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest by submitting this ""research"" to independent experts for a second and third opinion as a check against bias?  Why didn't they solicit the input of public-school officials for a more informed opinion before closing these schools? 
Or is this asking too much of human nature since money is always the most eloquent advocate when arguing a case?
Did this ""research"" unearth any problems that were not related to decades of systemic underfunding of public schools, as opposed to the billions that would now be pouring into charter coffers to elated investors?  ***
Why didn't these governors with their misgivings about public schools, which had served the nation well for over 150 years, bring their ""research"" to the public at once, lest it later be suggested that they simply colluded in inventing this claim? 
Or why didn't they call a national news conference to outline their findings and produce this ""research"" that would confirm their claim, research that, curiously, has never been provided?
More curiously still, why didn't the press, in that once grand tradition of investigative journalism, seize upon this absence of evidence and expose these governors for what they were doing? 
If closing public schools was contingent on ""evidence"" which was never provided, then it was safe to assume that it never existed for, if it did, these governors would have produced it in support of their claim. 
Put briefly, there was never a basis for closing these schools! 
Surely, seasoned journalists must have realized what was actually happening, so why didn't they go public with it? And now you begin to understand what is going on in this country.   ***
Or why didn't these governors hold exhaustive, wide-ranging, and televised hearings into these public-school ""weaknesses,"" call witnesses, and solicit learned opinion on both sides of this question? 
Did they think that the public didn't have a stake in the success of its schools and wouldn't want to know what was wrong with them? 
Or did these governors fear a public outcry from public-school parents who might have disagreed with them, thereby depriving these governors of a pretext for closing these schools?
Why didn't these governors want an open and honest public discussion about their claims, unless they feared they'd lose control of the narrative and be exposed as having no case?
Is it any wonder, then, that they proceeded by stealth rather than dealing with public anger during these hearings? Does this explain their cloak-and-dagger secrecy, their keeping to the shadows, their failure to provide information except when schools closures had occurred? 
Wasn't it easier to plunge these schools into chaos by simply closing them and replacing them with unregulated charters, without any proof of these charters' vaunted superiority, with their countless scandals of financial corruption that have since come to light?
 ***
And what of the millions of public-school children whose education has been disrupted? Why are these governors still bleeding their schools white by drastic underfunding to cause these children to fail and their schools to close and re-open as charters?
Why do the majority of these closings unfairly target Black and Hispanic children from poor neighborhoods in a new form of Jim Crow racism? 
And what of the millions of their outraged parents, whose lives, families, and neighborhood communities have been turned upside down by these governors beholden to a corporate agenda rather than the public schools they swore to protect?
And what of those tens of thousands of teachers thrown out of work because of an unfounded claim that their schools were failing, a tactic that weakens public-school unions as part of these governors' corporate agenda?
 ***
Was closing these schools about anything but a contempt for democracy and the rights of citizens, who now realize what they have always suspected -- that there is something very rotten in this state of Denmark?
Are these governors concerned about the open secret that their educational ""reform"" has been exposed as a hoax, devised by the charter school industry with the collusion of governors to weaken America's trust in its public schools?
Are they concerned that the public now understands that closing public schools was merely the pretext for enriching charters by misappropriating billions to defraud children of a public-school education, which has never been about profit for investors, but only about children?
Are they concerned that these unregulated charters are exempt from state regulations for keeping financial records, a golden inducement to widespread corruption?
Why did these governors and their state legislatures sanction these sweetheart deals in the charters they grant these privatized schools as a quid pro quo for campaign contributions in this brave new world of educational ""reform""?
Who will guard these guards themselves, who perjure themselves that they'll guard our democracy and its public schools, and then proceed to destroy them?
How do we protect ourselves against guards such as these, who think themselves above the law and too big to jail?

C. M. Rubin's global education report from Canada, China, the US and the UK.
In December, I continued my conversations with world leaders on the frontiers of education reform. These leaders (from Canada, China, America and the UK) all share a commitment to transforming education at the ground level, so that the poorest and most disadvantaged schools can become sites for development of innovative education and can create smart and employable future citizens. 
From Canada, I talked to Mary Jean Gallagher, (Chief Student Achievement Officer of Ontario and Assistant Deputy Minister of the Student Achievement Division of the Ontario Ministry of Education) about the extensive educational turnaround in Ontario. The statistics are proof of the significant success. For instance, over the past decade, the percentage of students meeting provincial standards in the annual literacy and numeracy tests for grades three and six has risen from 54 percent to 71 percent, and the high school graduation rate has increased from 68 percent to 83 percent. Gallagher explains that this was caused by offering support at multiple levels of the system: ""Support is provided in the form of advice, shared research into effective practices, opportunities for exchanging insights among peers, and the funding per school ($15,000) for release time out of the normal work schedule for planning, monitoring, reflecting on and integrating what is being learned into classroom practice.""
From China, I talked to Jiang Xueqin (deputy principal of highly regarded Tsinghua University High School) about how to offer progressive education in a nation where the gap between rich and poor is immense. This requires creating programs early on for the disadvantaged children in China, investing in vocational programs, and building a national system of community colleges. He also spoke of his teaching philosophy: ""It requires tremendous emotional intelligence, self-understanding, wisdom, maturity, and confidence to maintain a minimal interventionist attitude while offering non-judgmental support and encouragement. Teachers and students are the real stars of any great school, and real education leadership means playing a backstage and supporting role."" 
From the United States, I talked to Harvard professor Howard Gardner about how his innovative concept, Good Grit, meaning the combination of character and drive, can be applied to education systems across the globe. Gardner was joined by Jeffrey Beard from the UK (former Director General of the International Baccalaureate Organization, now Founder and Chairman of Global Study Pass). Gardner and Beard show that Good Grit is a breakthrough concept in education reform and can pave the way for students to do better in the increasingly competitive global marketplace. Moreover, Gardner and Beard suggest that Good Grit will lead to a more collaborative and ethical future. 
In the words of Gardner, ""If you simply want to have the most toys at the end of life, you might get away with Bad or Compromised Grit. But if you pursue goals beyond self-aggrandizement, then you can do well both for yourself and for the world. And even if you don't aim to change the world, being truthful and trustworthy serve you well in every marketplace.""
Finally, I want to take this opportunity to wish a very happy new year to all our contributors and followers around the world. May we never stop learning and growing from these global conversations we so enjoy.

55,COLLEGE,The Intrinsic Value of Liberal Education,"Grant Cornwell, ContributorPresident, The College of Wooster",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-intrinsic-value-of-li_b_6163986.html,"A liberal education is an expansion of consciousness: with every book read, every natural or social system grasped, every theory put to the test and employed, we become persons with greater scope and agency.",2014-11-16,EDUCATION,"In my last post, I made the case that a liberal arts degree remains a great investment, in the most practical of terms: skills development, career opportunity, and lifetime earnings. The question I would like to pose today is this: Does pursuing a liberal education also have intrinsic worth? Would it be worth choosing for its own sake, aside from all of its considerable practical value?
The candidates for human endeavors worth pursuing for their own sake, even if nothing further came of them, are surprisingly few. They include endeavors or experiences like: loving another person; engaging in worship for those who practice a faith; having an aesthetically moving experience of art or music or nature; practicing benevolence, kindness, generosity, or compassion.
To this list I would add the endeavor of becoming liberally educated. The very project of seeking understanding, of considering deeply and rigorously what is currently known in one's own quest for understanding, and to advance the depth and completeness of human understanding overall, are among the most intrinsically worthy or valuable endeavors in the human scope.
A liberal education is an expansion of consciousness: with every book read, every natural or social system grasped, every theory put to the test and employed, we become persons with greater scope and agency. Every book or poem, film or equation, image or idea that we struggle to grasp expands and complicates our souls and enlarges our capacities to make meaning of the world and effect change.
Pursuing in earnest the personal and intellectual capacities that we say graduates should possess - independent thinking, integrative and collaborative inquiry, effective communication, global engagement and respect for diversity, civic and social responsibility, - amounts to a sort of soulcraft. In the very process of liberal inquiry in the arts and sciences, one creates an identity, not just with greater breadth and depth of understanding, but also with greater capacity for action, greater freedom and independence, not only to pursue one's own ends, but to influence positively the well-being of the world.
During their time on campus, no matter what their majors, students pursuing a liberal education are certain at some point, perhaps at many points, to change their minds. Reflect on that phrase: ""I changed my mind."" What a profound thing it is to change one's mind. And that is exactly why the living and learning community of a liberal arts college exists. For many, perhaps most, of our students, these changes are hard won. They are the product of toil and struggle, of progress punctuated by failure and anxiety. Because in changing their minds, in making up their minds, they are engaged in the process of becoming; they are creating an identity out of the raw materials of their studies and experiences. And that, I submit, is a profoundly valuable and worthy human endeavor. 
It is also an enormous privilege, which carries with it the responsibility to deeply and seriously embrace the opportunity and then put it to work in the world to advance the opportunities of others.
This whole package - of pursuing and advancing understanding, of making up one's mind, of becoming oneself and equipping oneself to contribute to the well-being of the world - this is what we call liberal education.
And, yes, it has inestimable value.

56,EDUCATION,Learning From Improvement or Not,"Karin Chenoweth, ContributorWriter-in-residence at The Education Trust",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/learning-from-improvement_b_6764414.html,"When I visited it was clear that a lot of things had spurred school improvement, but it had all started with a change in leadership. This is completely in line with all the best research -- school improvement almost always starts with a new principal.",2015-02-26,EDUCATION,"Whenever I see that a low-performing school's students have improved their performance on state tests, I am curious. What happened?
That is why I was eager to visit a school that was one of the lowest performing in the state three years ago, but last year showed dramatic improvement.
Other than to say it's located in a mostly affluent exurb of a major metropolitan area, and that just about all the kids qualify for free and reduced-price meals, I'm not going to identify the school. Interspersed with a sprinkling of African American and white children, most of the school's students are from families of recent immigrants, chiefly from Central and South America. 
When I visited it was clear that a lot of things had spurred school improvement, but it had all started with a change in leadership. This is completely in line with all the best research -- school improvement almost always starts with a new principal.
The principal who took the job almost three years ago was the only person to apply for the position. In fact, some other principals in his district tried to commiserate with him, saying, ""I would never go there.""
He told me that the school he arrived in was broken in a lot of ways, with the most visible being that it was filthy. The maintenance staff, the principal said, had felt little investment in the school; their disengagement was in many ways symbolic of the entire operation, from the teachers to the kids.
When I visited recently, the building was pretty much spotless -- you could practically see your face in the shiny floors.
In all the classrooms I saw, the kids were engaged and working. When I asked any of them to tell me what they were doing I never once heard one say, ""A worksheet."" They said things like, ""I'm converting improper fractions to mixed numbers,"" or ""I'm identifying which statements are true and which are opinion."" I didn't see a single disciplinary problem; in fact only 47 kids were referred last year to the office for disciplinary problems -- down from almost 300 two years before -- and the principal said the school was on track to have even fewer this year.
The principal describes his first year as a difficult one. He had to put in place a lot of systems to support the improvement of instruction, from scheduling to budgeting to a positive behavior system, and he had to change the way a lot of things were done. One of his first acts was to require that teachers spend two days a week of their planning time in collaborative grade-level meetings. He or his assistant principal sat in -- and continue to sit in -- on every one of those meeting to ensure that teachers focused on unpacking standards, mapping out instruction, and planning lessons, assessments, and interventions. This was a change to the way the teachers had been working, and not all of them welcomed that change -- quite a few transferred to other schools.
This year the teachers themselves decided that they would meet five times a week -- in other words, teachers have made every one of their planning periods a team meeting because they have seen how they and their students benefitted from collaboration.
In terms of results on the state tests, the principal's first year was disappointing -- there was no real change in how the kids performed. But the second year saw a huge jump in proficiency rates, particularly in math. By huge jumps I mean that instead of 30 percent of students meeting math standards, 60 or 70 percent did, depending on the grade level. In one classroom every single student was proficient, including the students with learning disabilities.
The school still has a ways to go. But teachers are focused on instruction and bring a sense of urgency to their collaboration meetings and their classrooms, a sense that is matched by the enthusiasm of the students.
Because of the school's dramatic improvement, some area teachers and administrators ask to visit so that they can understand what the school is doing. To my mind, those educators represent the hopes of the field. They want to see for themselves the kinds of things that make a difference, presumably with the idea that they have something to learn from the success of their colleagues.
But the reaction of other educators represents one of the reasons it is so hard for education to improve. For example, fellow principals have directly asked the principal how he managed to game the system to get improved test results. When his teachers go to district meetings they are being treated as pariahs by their colleagues. ""They get all these remarks designed to bring them down and make them feel as if they are doing something wrong,"" the principal said. Instead of being asked how they achieved the kind of growth they achieved, they are isolated.
I'm not sure why that happens, but I think some educators have firmly internalized the belief that children from low-income families and children of color can't achieve at high levels. They so accept the inevitability of failure that they would rather believe that high-performing high-poverty schools are cheating than make the effort to figure out what helps them succeed. 
""Nobody expects our kids to do it,"" is the way the principal put it.
I have talked with enough educators from high-performing high-poverty schools to know that he is not describing an isolated phenomenon. Instead of being consulted for their knowledge and expertise, educators in high-performing and rapidly improving schools are often subject to suspicion and accusations.
I am not arguing against skepticism. All proclamations of success should be greeted with healthy skepticism. But sometimes success is actually solid, built on research-based practices and the craft knowledge of expert educators.
If the field of education is to move forward, it needs to identify and learn from those successes.

A summary of Cornell University’s Interfraternity Council’s findings, posted to the school’s website, now reads that “the Review Board did not have evidence and therefore did not find that any individual associated with the chapter had in fact acted on such encouragement or that the contest had actually occurred,” noting that the summary had previously “mischaracterized the findings of the Review Board, including the role of the chapter.”
Previously:
A Cornell University fraternity conducted a game in which new members competed to have sex with the most women ― and additional points were granted in the event of a tie to the contestant who had intercourse with a woman weighing the most, a school investigation revealed recently.
The university’s Fraternity and Sorority Review Board placed Zeta Beta Tau, which called its contest a “pig roast,” on probation for two years because of its misconduct last spring. The ruling also mandated that it hire a “live-in advisor” and receive ongoing education on sexual violence. Most of the chapter will also have to attend two events during Cornell’s Sexual Assault Awareness Week in April.
Ryan Lombardi, vice president for student and campus life, said in a statement the school emailed to HuffPost on Wednesday that ZBT’s actions were “abhorrent to me and antithetical to our values as a community.”
“Behavior that degrades and dehumanizes women contributes to a climate and culture of tolerance for sexual violence,” he said. “While sanctions have been levied against this fraternity by the Fraternity and Sorority Review Board, the campus community will be watching to see whether the members of ZBT ― as individuals and as a group ― live up to their public pledge to demonstrate ‘through our actions that this inexcusable behavior will not be tolerated.’”
ZBT’s Cornell chapter said on Facebook Saturday that the activities “were neither chapter sanctioned activities, nor ones that brothers were aware of. We, too, are in disbelief and even more so that these alleged actions may have been taken by those whom we called brothers.”
The post says the chapter will review its membership and expel anyone not meeting its standards.
“The allegations described are contrary to the values that Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity espouses and works in direct conflict with the beliefs and mission of the Kappa Chapter,” it wrote. “Our chapter has worked closely with the Zeta Beta Tau International Headquarters to draft and execute an action plan that addresses this alleged behavior.”

""I am proud of the progress and accomplishments achieved by the college over what will be a nine-year tenure as president,"" Rochon wrote in a statement. ""I look forward to working with the college community over the next 18 months in a constructive and collaborative way, making progress on issues of diversity and inclusion, shared governance, and decision making.""
The upstate New York school plans to launch a search for the next president in summer 2016.
In November, roughly 1,000 Ithaca students participated in a walkout after a series of racist incidents on campus, including alleged racial profiling by campus police officers and a themed ""Preps and Crooks"" fraternity party. The demonstration was inspired by similar protests at the University of Missouri, which led the university's then-president, Tim Wolfe, to resign amid pressure from students over his handling of racial tensions at the school.
Protesters in Ithaca said they were calling for Rochon's resignation because the administration had not done enough to address racism on campus. In December, Ithaca alumni joined that call.
During a November vote organized by Ithaca's Student Government Association, nearly 72 percent of 3,756 participating students voted that they had ""no confidence"" in Rochon. Weeks later, the school's faculty voted similarly. 
“The message that has come through to me in the form of the student and faculty votes has been a difficult one to hear, but I am listening,” Rochon said of the vote, according to student newspaper The Ithacan. ""I understand that many people on our campus are frustrated with the pace of change and with my own role in effecting it. I remain determined to improve Ithaca College’s culture for the better.""

59,EDUCATION,Dear Teachers: Don’t Be Good Soldiers For The EdTech Industry,"Steven Singer, ContributorHusband, father, teacher, education advocate",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dear-teachers-dont-be-good-soldiers-for-the-edtech_us_59b83e92e4b06b71800c3528,There is a force out there that’s working to destroy our profession.,2017-09-12,EDUCATION,"Dear fellow teachers,
Thank you for coming to this meeting on such short notice.
I know you have plenty more important matters to attend to this morning. I, myself, left a pile of ungraded papers on my desk so I could get here. Not to mention I urgently need to fix my seating charts now that I’ve finally met my students and know who can sit with whom. And I’ve got to track down phone numbers for my kids’ parents and go through a mountain of Individual Education Plans, and… well, I just want you to know that I get it.
There are a lot of seemingly more pressing concerns than listening to a teacher-blogger jabber about the intersection of politics and our profession.
Is that all of us? Okay, would someone please close the door?
Good. No administrators in here, right? Just classroom teachers? Excellent.
Let’s speak openly. There’s something very important we need to talk about.
There is a force out there that’s working to destroy our profession.
Yes, ANOTHER one!
We’ve got lawmakers beholden to the corporate education reform industry on the right and media pundits spewing Wall Street propaganda on the left. The last thing we need is yet another group dedicated to tearing down our public schools.
But there is. And it is us.
You heard me right.
It’s us.
There is an entire parasitic industry making billions of dollars selling us things we don’t need – standardized tests, Common Core workbook drivel, software test prep THIS, and computer test crap THAT.
We didn’t decide to use it. We didn’t buy it. But who is it who actually introduces most of this garbage in the classroom?
That’s right. US.
We do it. Often willingly.
We need to stop.
And before someone calls me a luddite, let me explain. I’m not saying technology is bad. It’s a tool like anything else. There are plenty of ways to use it to advance student learning. But the things we’re being asked to do… You know in your heart that they aren’t in the best interests of children.
I know. Some of you have no choice. You live in a state or district where teacher autonomy is a pathetic joke. There are ways to fight that, but they’re probably not in the classroom.
It’s not you who I’m talking to. I’m addressing everyone else. I’m talking to all the teachers out there who DO have some modicum of control over their own classrooms and who are told by their administrators to do things that they honestly disagree with – but they do it anyway.
We’ve got to stop doing it.
Corporations want to replace us with software packages. They want to create a world where kids sit in front of computers or iPads or some other devices for hours at a time doing endless test prep. You know it’s true because your administrator probably is telling you to proctor such rubbish in your own classroom so many hours a week. I know MINE is.
Listen, there are several reasons why we should refuse.
First, there’s simple job security. If your principal brought in a Teach for America temp and told you this lightly trained fresh from college kid was going to take over your classes, would you really sit down and instruct her how to do your job!?
I wouldn’t.
That’s the entire point behind this tech industry garbage. You are piloting a program that means your own redundancy.
You are engaged in an effort to prove that they don’t need a fully trained, experienced, four-year degree professional to do this job. They just need a glorified WalMart greeter to watch the kids as they push buttons and stare at a screen. They just need a minimum wage drone to take up space while the children bask in the warm glow of the program, while it maps their eye movements, catalogues how long it takes them to answer, records their commercial preferences and sells all this data to other companies so they can better market products – educational and otherwise – back to these kids, their school and their parents.
This isn’t about improving educational outcomes. It’s about bringing the cost down and pocketing the savings as profit.
It’s about replacing the end-of-the-year standardized test with daily mini stealth assessments that are just as high stakes and just as effective at providing an excuse for the state or the feds to swoop in and steal control, disband the school board and give the whole shebang to the charter school operator who gives them the most generous campaign donations.
Do NOT be a good soldier here. Do not just follow orders. Doing so is weakening our entire profession. It is putting our jobs in jeopardy. And it’s about time our national teachers unions figured this out instead of conceding the point so their leaders can keep a seat at the table. Someone needs to tell them they shouldn’t be sitting inside the building. They should be with us, outside surrounding it with signs and pitchforks.
The EdTech shell game is not about improving student learning. It’s a commercial coup, not a progressive renaissance.
Think about it.
They call this trash “personalized learning.” How can it really be personalized if kids do the same exercises just at different rates? How is it personalized if it’s standardized? How is it personalized if it omits the presence of actual people in the education process?
It’s teach-by-numbers, correspondence school guano with graphics and a high speed Internet connection.
But we give in. We don’t want to rock the boat. We’re rule followers, most of us. We do what we’re told.
Most teachers were good students, and obedience is too often a defining quality of those who succeed in our education system.
I get it. You don’t want to be a fly in the ointment. You don’t want to make yourself a target.
Me, too.
How dearly I would love to be able to just comply. But I can’t simply go along with something I know in my heart to be wrong. And this is wrong on so many levels.
I sat through a meeting much like this one earlier this year where I was told exactly which programs to force on my students. All the while good teachers whom I respect went through the motions as if nothing was wrong. They talked about how to organize our classes in the system, how to assign test prep and how often, and how to access the data.
But we never discussed why.
We never discussed if doing so was a good idea. That was all taken for granted. It was a decision reserved for someone else, someone from a higher pay grade.
Yet classroom experience is rarely commensurate with salary scale especially once you cross the line into management. Nor is the experience of a handful of administrators equal to that of a plentitude of staff!
No. I’m sorry. At very least that is a discussion WE should be having.
It is the TEACHER’S job to determine what is educationally appropriate. Not the administrators. At most, the building principal should be part of that discussion in her role as lead teacher. But the resolution to go ahead or not should be made together as a staff.
And if an individual teacher thinks based on their own experience with their own students that they should go in a different direction, they should be respected enough as a professional to have the autonomy to do so.
Teachers have to abide by best practices, but test prep in any form is NOT a best practice.
It’s time we stood up en masse and made that clear.
We are our own worst enemy in this regard.
We are too submissive. Too meek.
This world requires teachers to be revolutionaries, to be radicals.
And that doesn’t end in the classroom.
We need to educate parents and the community about what’s happening. The classroom doors are too often closed to the public. The only information they get is from anemic administrators and a mass media that invariably just reports whatever propaganda the corporation puts on the press releases.
We are responsible for our students. We must protect them from the vultures out there trying to water down their educations and reduce the quality of their learning.
We are not the only ones who can take a stand. In fact, IF we are the only ones who do it, we will certainly fail.
But, along with parents, students and concerned citizens, we MUST be part of that resistance.
We MUST take a stand for our children and our profession.
Because without us, there is no hope of success.
So we can no longer afford to be good soldiers in someone else’s army.
It’s time to have the courage of our convictions.
It’s time to rise up, walk hand-in-hand to the front of the staff meeting and tell our administrators:
NO.
Because if we don’t, no one else will.

60,COLLEGE,Diverse Conversations: Being Transparent,"Matthew Lynch, Ed.D., ContributorAuthor of The Call to Teach and editor of The Edvocate, www.th...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/diverse-conversations-bei_b_5684976.html,Many higher education professionals often complain that the higher-ups at their institutions are not transparent in their dealings. This can have a negative impact on faculty morale and thus a devastating effect on the functioning of an institution.,2014-08-17,EDUCATION,"Many higher education professionals often complain that the higher-ups at their institutions are not transparent in their dealings. This can have a negative impact on faculty morale and thus a devastating effect on the functioning of an institution. To talk about how institutions can actually ensure transparency and counteract the problem of lacking transparency, I recently sat down with Laurie M. Joyner, president of Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio.
Transparency is, of course, a vital component of just about any professional enterprise, but it is particularly important in higher education for maintaining positive relationships within the organization structure - between higher education and those that I am referring to here as ""the higher ups"", which include administrators and so forth. Why do you think transparency is so important in this context? 
Transparency in communication and action builds trust, which is essential to effective shared governance. The strategic challenges facing higher education today, including remaining mission-driven within the context of a sustainable financial model, touch upon deeply held beliefs about institutional direction. Our academic values and tradition recognize that such critical decisions are best informed by the perspectives of faculty, staff, students, alumni and board members. A lack of transparency with any constituent group compromises our ability to form effective partnerships necessary for creating a shared vision required to move our institutional agenda forward. 
Q: In your experience, what are some of the most common problems when transparency is not maintained? What does that look like in terms of organizational function and relationships between higher education professionals and the administrators, the leaders? 
A: The most common problem is that a perception of mistrust is likely to develop making it more difficult to align priorities and efforts designed to strengthen the institution. When priorities are not aligned between faculty, administrators, and the governing board, organizational functioning may be negatively impacted. This often appears as tensions surrounding the rights and responsibilities of various groups for certain types of decisions. The challenge, of course, is that more attention and energy can become focused on who has prime responsibility for what decisions versus figuring out how to collaborate in a collegial manner to address the most pressing issues facing the institution. In some cases, relationships become strained, decision making can stall, and ultimately, organizational effectiveness is compromised. 
It's also important to note that while transparency is a healthy aspect of organizational culture, it is not necessarily sufficient for effective governance. Effective governance requires ongoing education regarding the strategic issues impacting the organization (e.g., shifting demographics, improving educational outcomes, exploiting competitive strengths, etc.) Insisting on transparency regarding key institutional metrics can build support for difficult decisions, facilitate continuous improvement, and meet the growing demand for quantitative outcome data. 
Q: Drawing from these first two questions, what would you say are the most important areas for maintaining transparency; where is it particularly important in higher education institutions? 
A: A commitment to transparency should be pervasive for the benefit of all internal and external stakeholders. This transparency can be exceedingly helpful in facilitating data-driven decisions, supporting continuous improvement, and fostering a culture of accountability regarding institutional performance at all levels. From a faculty perspective, transparency is of special importance in the following areas: institutional planning and budgeting; curricular requirements; academic integrity; academic freedom; and the selection, evaluation and promotion of faculty colleagues. 
In my experience, there are two areas that present special challenges to administrative leaders who value transparency. These areas relate to personnel and legal issues where one is not at liberty to discuss the circumstances surrounding particular decisions. It is frustrating to face community resistance that is not based on complete information and not be in a position to respond. 
Q: What are the key benefits for maintaining transparency in higher education, from an administrative and leadership standpoint? 
A: The main benefit is that it builds a culture of open communication and trust, both of which are necessary to create a sense of partnership for effectively accomplishing the important work of the institution. Given the challenges facing higher education today, it is critical to do everything possible to align our collective efforts around shared priorities as we work toward achieving our common purpose. 
An additional benefit of transparency is that it also supports the development of increasingly refined performance metrics that are useful in supporting a culture of continuous improvement across the organization while also responding to calls for greater accountability for student and institutional outcomes. 
Q: How, then, do you go about establishing and ultimately maintaining transparency in higher education institutions?
A: I think this is best accomplished by respecting the systems of shared governance involving the Board, the President and senior administrators, and the faculty. In many cases, this is easier said than done because different constituent groups have varying levels of understanding as it relates to effective governance practices (e.g., who has more or less responsibility and authority for making certain types of decisions). Given this, I believe ongoing professional development is required at every level of the organization to ensure that all key constituent groups are being supported as they adopt best practices to enhance shared governance. 
A deep commitment to transparency also supports continuous improvement across the organization and contributes to a culture of assessment and accountability. Once these elements are structured into organizational policies and practices, they strengthen and reinforce one another, ultimately improving shared governance and educational quality. 
Q: At Wittenberg University, transparency is something that you emphasize at these various levels. Beyond these basic methods and strategies for establishing and maintaining transparency, what strategies have you found to be most effective for maintaining transparency? 
A: We have worked hard to try to educate our campus on some of the core challenges facing Wittenberg. This is a critical point. There must be general agreement on the challenges if there is any chance of aligning the efforts of the campus community and Board. We have also worked very hard to communicate early and often using a range of strategies. For example, I host community dialogue sessions to discuss areas of concern and to respond to any community questions. I also distribute Board agendas to the faculty, report the actions taken at each Board meeting to all faculty and staff, and distribute an electronic newsletter to faculty, staff, and retirees every two weeks. I also provide similar monthly updates to Board and Emeriti Board members. In addition, we are working to develop more refined outcome metrics to assess progress toward key institutional goals. The intent is to eventually have all these metrics readily available to anyone interested in tracking institutional performance over time. 
Q: In your experience, when there are transparency issues and they are proving problematic, how have you proceeded to address the issues and restore transparency? 
A: In my experience, proceeding in an honest, open and authentic way is always the preferred approach with all constituencies. Further, ensuring that all elements of the governance system are working as effectively as possible and then routinely consulting with appropriate groups is essential. If there are not effective structures or systems in place, then creating meaningful structures to bring various groups together to focus on important issues can help foster understanding, enhance transparency, increase collaboration, and improve results. 
Q: Inevitably there are some instances in which administrators inherit transparency issues and that's what I'd like to focus on in this question. What advice would you give to a higher education administrator who is facing problems with transparency? What advice would you give in terms of establishing transparency and, if you like, dealing with the fallout of the initial transparency issue? 
A: Communicating about the issues in a forthright manner and establishing structures to help address difficult questions are important. I also think recognizing that shared governance is challenging and requires ongoing attention is critical. At Wittenberg, we have initiated an effort to strengthen Board governance with support from the Association of Governing Boards (AGB). From my perspective, there are few issues more strategic than ensuring that our governing Board understands its rights and responsibilities as it relates to our institution. 
My hope is to initiate a similar process internally to enhance the working relationships between our faculty committees, senior administrators, and Board. Through these parallel efforts to strengthen governance, I believe Wittenberg will be better served because our systems will become more closely aligned as we work toward shared priorities within the context of clearer expectations regarding our respective responsibilities. Ultimately, I believe this work will result in greater satisfaction for our faculty leaders, administrators, and Board members and will also foster improved institutional outcomes. 
Thank you for your time, President Joyner. This concludes our interview.

61,EDUCATION,"Vergara Identified A Few Real Problems, But It's Completely Wrong About The Solutions","Ben Spielberg, Contributor34Justice co-founder and blogger",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vergara-education-schools_b_5493503.html,Judge Treu's opinion unfortunately reflects a misunderstanding of education research and teacher employment law's effects. His decision also erodes labor protections without increasing the likelihood of an excellent education for students in low-income communities.,2014-06-13,EDUCATION,"Judge Rolf Treu ruled in favor of Students Matter in Vergara v. California, deeming teacher permanent status (commonly called ""tenure""), due process protections for teachers with permanent status, and seniority-based layoffs unconstitutional. Treu's opinion unfortunately reflects a misunderstanding of education research and teacher employment law's effects. His decision also erodes labor protections without increasing the likelihood of an excellent education for students in low-income communities.
Reformer excitement about the ruling demonstrates how successfully the plaintiffs have conflated teacher employment law with the existence of ineffective teachers. Informed advocates for low-income students and communities, on the other hand, are deeply disappointed because both ethical considerations and a thorough analysis of the case indicate the error in Treu's findings.
The California Teachers Association (CTA) plans to appeal the decision and higher courts will hopefully see through the plaintiffs' weak case. No matter the appeal's outcome, Treu's opinion raises two issues considerably more significant for low-income students than teacher dismissal and layoff procedures: 
1) Teacher evaluation and support practices: Treu wrote that 18+ months of employment is not ""nearly enough time for an informed decision to be made regarding the decision of tenure,"" arguing that administrator fear of permanent status deprives ""teachers of an adequate opportunity to establish their competence."" He wants ""to have the tenure decision made after"" California teachers finish BTSA, an induction program teachers must complete to clear their credentials, and he suggests a timeline of three to five years.
Treu is correct that some ineffective teachers are currently retained and some good teachers are currently dismissed under California's system, but he's wrong about the primary reason why. Instead, inadequate approaches to teacher evaluation and a lack of quality teacher support have long hindered the development and retention of excellent teachers. Nearly two years is far longer than a supervisor should need to evaluate teacher performance and potential for growth if evaluation systems provide frequent opportunities for meaningful feedback and support about specific teacher practices. 
Unions and many reform organizations actually agree about the goals of teacher evaluation. The New Teacher Project (TNTP), for example, believes that ""the core purpose of evaluation must be maximizing teacher growth and effectiveness, not just documenting poor performance as a prelude to dismissal."" Similarly, CTA believes that ""the purpose of an effective teacher development and evaluation system is to inform, instruct and improve teaching and learning; to provide educators with meaningful feedback on areas of strength and where improvement is needed; and to ensure fair and evidence-based employment decisions."" Though reformer support for the use of standardized test score results as a percentage of teacher evaluations may decrease teaching quality and detract from student learning, TNTP and CTA also agree about many areas in which evaluation practices need improvement: the training administrators receive on how to give meaningful feedback, the quality of professional growth plans and professional development opportunities, and the frequency and length of classroom observations.
Extending new teachers' probationary periods indefinitely will not address the underlying causes of the problem Treu identifies. In fact, the argument that two years isn't ""nearly enough time"" implicitly grants license for administrative incompetence and practices that inadequately address new teachers' professional needs. Education stakeholders committed to developing and identifying great new teachers should instead pour their time, money, and energy into aligning evaluation and support systems with their goals. San Jose Unified School District (SJUSD) and the San Jose Teachers Association (SJTA), for example, have invested in administrator training, evaluative consulting teachers with content-area teaching expertise, evaluation documents that more accurately define effective teaching and require narrative feedback, a Teacher Quality Panel consisting of both teacher and administrator members, and non-evaluative instructional coaching support.
2) School funding: Treu's ruling erroneously considers Vergara v. California part of a historical record of education-related court cases including Brown v. Board of Education, Serrano v. Priest, and Butt v. California. These three cases, unlike Vergara, dealt with undebatable and direct inequities in access to educational opportunity for low-income and minority students: segregated schools (Brown), inequitable access to school funding (Serrano), and inequitable access to a full school year (Butt). Treu fails to note that, despite the Serrano case and the advent of California's new Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), major inequities in education funding persist in California today.
In 2012-2013, for example, SJUSD received approximately $9,000 per pupil in revenue. During the same year, Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD) received about 60% more money per pupil, approximately $14,500. While California guarantees a certain amount of annual funding called a ""revenue limit"" to every school district in the state, some districts, like PAUSD, bring in property tax revenues that exceed the revenue limit. These ""basic aid"" districts keep their excess property tax revenue and often pass parcel taxes that further increase the funding discrepancy between lower-income districts and their higher-income basic aid counterparts.
More funding is not a panacea for low-income schools - how districts spend their money determines its return -- but research is clear that funding matters a great deal. Politicians who cut education-related spending for poor communities often cite a 33-year-old study by Eric Hanushek to oppose equitable school funding, yet even Hanushek himself cautiously supports it. Asked in a 2006 interview if ""it's a good idea to give very high-poverty districts more funding per pupil than an average district,"" Hanushek responded: ""I think so. I think you have to provide extra resources and help for kids who start at a lower point because of their backgrounds."" It's impossible to support educational equity and justify the funding discrepancy between SJUSD and PAUSD.
One of the most important provisions of the LCFF -- the supplemental funding it provides to districts that serve high numbers of English language learners, students from low-income families, and students from foster homes -- moves California in the right direction. However, basic aid districts that have long been able to afford better resources for students will continue to exist. Based on the case history Treu cites, one could construct a very strong case that the existence of basic aid districts violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the California Constitution. Advocates for low-income students could also make an indirect equal protection case about Proposition 13's effect on school funding disparities. Unlike Vergara v. California, these cases could continue the tradition of Brown, Serrano, and Butt by remedying a clear instance of educational inequity.
Treu's ruling also invites an analysis of the definition of appropriate due process. The judge asserts that ""[t]here is no question that teachers should be afforded reasonable due process when their dismissals are sought,"" but he claims that current protections for teachers with permanent status constitute ""uber due process."" Treu proposes replacing teacher dismissal law with the rights guaranteed by the decision in Skelly v. State Personnel Board; because of Skelly, permanent employees facing dismissal must receive ""notice of the proposed action, the reasons therefor, a copy of the charges and materials upon which the action is based, and the right to respond, either orally or in writing, to the authority initially imposing discipline."" 
In essence, Skelly rights ensure that employers treat permanent employees with some semblance of courtesy and respect. While Treu asserts that due process considerations are ""entirely legitimate,"" however, he forgets to mention that probationary teachers do not have Skelly rights; in California, probationary teachers can be non-reelected (fired) without cause. Treu's argument is completely contradictory given current law -- he simultaneously contends that he believes in the concept of due process and that districts should be able to deprive people of it for three to five years.
Labor organizations support Skelly's basic protections for all employees because of the extensive history of inappropriate employer practices and a belief in treating people fairly. Due process protections should also include a requirement that administrators adequately support permanent teachers before attempting to dismiss them. A support-first mindset is not only the most ethical approach, but it's also important because, as Jack Schneider explains, ""you don't put... effective teacher[s] in every classroom by holding... sword[s] over their heads. You do it by putting tools in their hands."" Advocates for workers rights support streamlined dismissal processes for employees who are unwilling or unable to improve; the defendants in Vergara just know that society and schools benefit when employers are required to treat their employees like human beings.
Judge Treu accurately identifies a few key issues in his decision: administrators may struggle to identify quality teaching in fewer than two years, layoffs may deprive schools and students of stellar teachers, and teacher employment law may fail to grant teachers an appropriate amount of due process. Unfortunately, Vergara v. California neither improves teacher evaluation and support practices nor rectifies the funding inequities that lead to layoffs and resource cutbacks in districts that serve low-income students. The decision also ignores the complete lack of due process afforded to probationary teachers and fails to deliver a thoughtful recommendation about how to empower teachers to grow professionally. Informed, honest student advocates who care more about ""providing each child... with a basically equal opportunity to receive a quality education"" than about destroying organized labor should therefore hope that an appeals court will reverse Treu's decision. In the meantime, they should begin work on reforms more likely to improve opportunities for low-income students.

Undeniably, no matter where you are in your life; at your highest highs and your lowest lows, everything about your situation will inevitably change. It’s a mantra that can be repeated during tough times, and a lingering thought that tends to pop up in my head whenever things seem to be going too well. Constant change is a concept with which I’m still grappling as a sophomore in college, when it feels as though I’m finally comfortable in Ann Arbor and finally comfortable with myself. 
And, to be honest, I’m 20 f***ing years old – I don’t want my life to change that much. I love eating cheesy bread at 2 AM after too many rounds of tequila shots with my best friends, and, although it can be terrifying, I love the idea of having my whole life in front of me. I love living in the same house with 60 of the most wonderful girls I’ve ever met; I love my fierce independence and my ability to eat frozen yogurt three times a week and still fit into my leather skirt by Saturday night. I love that feeling when I finish a paper an hour before it’s due, heart beating out of my chest cause the last sentence is exactly how it’s supposed to be and I’ve had at least three cups of Starbucks cold brew. I love sleeping in until noon on weekends, binge-watching “Shameless,” and hiding out in coffee shops where no one recognizes me and time is measured in chapters of my current novel. Who I am right now, this really feels like me.
But then again, it always feels like that doesn’t it? It always feels like you’re as strong as you’re ever going to be until you’re forced to be stronger. It always feels like you’ve done your best until you’ve done better. And yeah, it makes my stomach drop, but I know that there are people I haven’t met yet who will change everything – there are mistakes to be made, battles to be won, pictures to be taken, hearts to be broken, jokes to be made, songs to be listened to, and dreams to be realized. Change is the only thing you can rely on; nothing about your life will stay the same, no matter how hard you try to prevent change, it will find you and it will flip everything upside down. So, I’ve learned to enjoy the view.
Change could also be a beacon of hope for those of you going through hell; the fact that your life will get better, not in a cheesy greeting card kind of way, but that it just will, the fact that it’s bound to, is something so comforting. If you’re like me, and you read “Nothing stays the same” as a sign of some impending doom, I think we need to chill out a bit. Or at least I do. Because, yeah, my whole world could fall apart tomorrow, but tomorrow could also be the best day of my life. This period of my life is pretty damn fun, but who’s to say this happiness isn’t just a fraction of what’s to come? Leave some room in your heart for the unimaginable. 
My friends and I always joke about how we’re “peaking,” about how these are the best years of our lives and we’ll never be this young again. It does seem silly, though, to believe that we’ve done all this changing, all this growth, to culminate at 20 years old. Change still scares the hell out of me, but it scares me in the same way that my future scares me – it’s scary knowing there isn’t a limit to what you can accomplish, it’s scary knowing that this is just the beginning. But it’s also absolutely intoxicating.

Last month, the department moved toward taking apart the “borrower defense rule,” which created standards and procedures for students injured by their schools to obtain debt relief. This week, the rule on the chopping block is “gainful employment,” which established bare minimum measures to penalize schools that consistently leave their students with insurmountable debt. Today, at the end of the troubling first day of what’s called negotiated rulemaking on the gainful employment rule, members of the public were given an opportunity to speak. I was the only one to speak, and I said this: 
This proceeding is blocking a regulation that was carefully considered and carefully crafted to protect students and taxpayers from well-documented abuses by some career colleges. Blocking the gainful employment rule means that more students will enroll in programs that will ruin their financial futures.
These students, as before, will be veterans, single mothers, people of color, immigrants, and the forgotten Americans President Trump promised to fight for. Many will enroll because of false promises about the selectivity of the school, the urgency of enrolling immediately, the cost of attending, transferability of credits, job placement, starting salaries. Many will enroll in programs that aren’t strong enough to help them succeed.
Even if these students graduate ― and many don’t ― and even if they get the job they dreamed of ― and many won’t ― they may not earn enough to pay down their loans, because the tuition was just too high. That is the problem the GE rule addressed, implementing a law passed by Congress in 1965.
My colleagues and I know hundreds of men and women who are buried in debt from attending dishonest schools, or simply overpriced schools. They’re good people. All they wanted was a chance to pursue their dreams and make better lives for their families. But instead of standing with them, Secretary DeVos is now standing with the people who have caused the harm, the people who have pocketed billions and required taxpayer bailout after taxpayer bailout.
The gainful employment rule would save money for taxpayers by pushing the department to remove from federal aid those schools that leave students worse off than when they enrolled.
But the issue papers prepared by the department for this meeting suggest its determination to cancel legitimate protections for students and taxpayers. 
I know and respect some owners and executives of for-profit schools. Some really do want the best for their students. The industry has many good teachers. There are many student success stories; I know some of these students, too.
Some owners expressed legitimate concerns during past rule makings. But over eight years of the last administration, the department took those concerns into consideration, and I believe we ended up with rules and policies that are more than fair to schools, rules that penalize bad actors while rewarding colleges that actually help students train for careers. 
The department announced in January that about 800 programs failed the GE test ― less than 10 percent of all GE programs.
I’m dismayed that owners whose programs passed or came close to passing GE don’t want to step up and make their programs work, instead of fighting to trash regulations that would put their most unscrupulous, irresponsible competitors ― the ones who have ruined the industry’s reputation ― out of business.
This process today is, in reality, about the corruption of our system. It’s about the blatant desire of some for-profit colleges, which are associated with political appointees, donors, and friends of this administration, to go back to the recent bad old days, when they could act with impunity ― deceiving and abusing students in order to maximize profits. Their misconduct, which has led to scores of federal and state law enforcement actions, and is still very much ongoing, has been a national scandal. And if you don’t do the right thing here, this proceeding will extend and embody that scandal.
State attorneys general ― Republicans and Democrats ― will continue to fight against for-profit college fraud. Responsible Members of Congress, media, and advocates for students will continue to expose abuses, and more prospective students will get the truth about bad actors, even if Secretary DeVos continues to weaken enforcement efforts, relax oversight of accreditors, approve sham conversions to non-profit status, and gut accountability rules. The department will be on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of justice, and the wrong side of our people.
Keep the existing gainful employment rule. If you do, you will improve the effectiveness, integrity, reputation, and ultimately the success of career colleges, and you will help these students.

UPDATE:  The New York Times reports that the search for Ian Jones has been suspended after a male body matching his description was found in the Hudson River on Monday afternoon.
An autopsy will be performed on Tuesday to determine the cause of death and to confirm Jones' identity. 
PREVIOUSLY: Tali Lennox-Fruchtmann, the daughter of legendary singer Annie Lennox, was rescued on Saturday after her kayak capsized outside Poughkeepsie, New York. Meanwhile, authorities are still searching for her boyfriend, Ian Jones, officials told People magazine.
The 22-year-old model-turned-artist and her 32-year-old boyfriend were kayaking on the Hudson River when they capsized at about 9:30 a.m., Dutchess County Sheriff's Captain John Watterson told The Huffington Post.
Lennox-Fruchtmann was rescued by a boat that was passing by, but Jones was nowhere to be found, according to officials. Jones, who is a photographer, was not wearing a life preserver and officials believe alcohol may have played a role in the incident, TMZ reported.
The search continued until 10 p.m. Saturday as a helicopter scanned the area from above and searchers walked the shore, Watterson told HuffPost. Efforts resumed at 7:30 a.m. Sunday with a Marine patrol and a dive team scanning the river. 
Authorities say there is a real possibility Jones may have drowned, since neither he nor Lennox-Fruchtmann were wearing life preservers. Watterson maintained they are doing everything they can to find him.

Reinhart, who regularly posts updates about her life on Tumblr, bravely penned an emotional story about being sexually harassed by an older co-worker when she was just a teenager. 
The two met while working together on a project and developed a flirtation despite their age difference. They even went out on a date, but she left feeling “completely violated” after he tried to force himself on her. 
“He was incredibly charming and charismatic — we flirted for a while before we went on our first date,” the 21-year-old actress explained. “He was pretty significantly older than me, but I thought of myself as mature so it didn’t seem like a big deal.”
“All that matters is that he tried to force himself on me when we were on a date,” she continued. “I had to stop him and say ‘no, I don’t want that,’ and ‘I can’t do that.’” Reinhart said she had to walk away to prevent the situation from going further.
“I remember feeling like this was a scene right out of a horror movie,” she added.
Despite her insistence on wanting to be taken home, the individual started driving back to his apartment instead, where Reinhart suspected he planned to take advantage of her. 
“If I made it there, something bad was going to happen to me,” she continued. “I told him to drop me off at my home, that I didn’t want to go back to his place. He said some snarky comment but reluctantly brought me to where I was staying.”
Reinhart purposefully doesn’t mention the perpetrator by name, writing that she didn’t comfortable or believe it’s necessary, but reveals she confronted him the next day about how “how wrong it felt.”
“This guy proceeded to tell me that it was my fault for leading him on. Saying that ‘I seemed like a sexual girl and that I’d be down for it,’” Reinhart wrote.
The actress said that the individual later became angry and defensive, “claiming that I was ‘a tease’ and ‘the most manipulative woman he’d ever met,’” she said.
At the time, Reinhart chose to stay silent, given how much power the manhad on set. She also feared that no one would believe her if she spoke up, and recalled feeling guilty about the situation and doubted her own instincts during their encounter.
The actress is speaking out now to demonstrate how common these abuses toward women are in the film industry, and to show her support for all who choose to speak out about similar experiences. 
“So I understand how these women feel - the women coming forward about being harassed and assaulted by Harvey Weinstein,” she concluded. “I stand with them. I believe them. I believe in standing up for yourself as a woman and coming forward about sexual harassment.”

LOS ANGELES, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Dreamworks Animation SKG Inc , the studio that built one of Hollywood's largest film franchises on the back of a green ogre named Shrek, has suddenly become one of the entertainment industry's busiest dealmakers.
In the last year, Dreamworks has bought a YouTube network aimed at teenagers and picked up a company that controls such iconic characters as Lassie and Casper the Friendly Ghost. It acquired the rights to the Troll toy franchise and in June, signed a deal to produce a TV series for streaming video service Netflix Inc. It also plans to build a $3 billion entertainment complex with partners in China.
And Dreamworks isn't finished.
""There will definitely be more deals,"" Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg said in an interview. ""I have never seen more opportunities to build our brand in our 19 years in business.""
Katzenberg will not say what else is on his list, or whether he prefers to buy or partner with other companies.
One thing still percolating, he says, is a Dreamworks cable channel, ""but there's nothing out there right now for us.""
A few years back, Dreamworks considered selling itself to a larger media company in hopes of converting its cable channel to one featuring Dreamworks movies or TV shows, according to news reports at the time.
Dreamworks' acquisition spree comes at a time when the animated film market has become so saturated with studio-backed fare that the studio's most recent entry, ""Turbo,"" debuted with two other animated films already in the market.
""Turbo"" ended up with lackluster ticket sales of $21 million in the United States and Canada during its first weekend. Earlier this year, Dreamworks took an $87 million write down for its holiday-themed ""Rise of the Guardians,"" and another $54 million charge to rework ""Me & My Shadow.""
Dreamworks hopes acquisitions can help expand its popular franchises, such as ""Shrek"" and ""Kung Fu Panda,"" beyond the big screen to television, toys and even theme parks. It is a formula that helped turn Walt Disney Co into the largest media conglomerate, with a market value of $118 billion. Dreamworks is tiny in comparison, with a market value of about $2.3 billion.
Investors have welcomed Katzenberg's diversification strategy, sending Dreamworks shares up 50 percent in the past year.
As a result of dealmaking, analyst Tony Wible of Janney Montgomery Scott predicts about 45 percent of Dreamworks' revenue this year will come from non-movie making, including TV shows produced by Classic Media, which Dreamworks bought last summer for $157.6 million.
Classic Media owns the rights to animated characters Richie Rich, Dick Tracy, and George of the Jungle, among others.
A year ago, Wible said, Dreamworks was getting only about 15 percent of revenue from areas other than newly released films, with most of that coming from DVD sales of older movies.
This year, Dreamworks expects to bring in $100 million in revenue from its television ventures. The estimate does not include revenue from AwesomenessTV, the teen-oriented YouTube network Dreamworks acquired in May.
Over the next five years, Dreamworks says it will produce 1,200 hours of programs for companies such as Netflix and German kids channel Super RTL, including those inspired from ""Turbo"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon.""
Dreamworks also will market merchandise from the Troll toy franchise after buying the rights to the line in April.
In July, a Dreamworks attraction with a Disney-style character-parade and other entertainment opened at the Sands Cotai Central casino, owned by Sands China Ltd, in Macau.
Dreamworks also is expanding in China, and is working with partners through a joint venture called Oriental Dreamworks to build a $3.1 billion entertainment district that will open in Shanghai in 2016. In addition, the venture will produce live-action movies and animated films for Chinese audiences.
But Katzenberg, who headed Disney's movie studio for a decade until 1994, denies the flurry of deals is a bid to recreate a modern day version of the media giant's far flung entertainment empire.
""Times have changed, this is totally different,"" he said. ""The thing we had in common were a great brand, some great content and a lot of opportunities to expand.""

Somers, who was famously fired from ""Three's Company"" when she asked executives for a 500 percent raise -- one that would place her in the same pay grade as Ritter -- explained why she devoted her ""DWTS"" number on Monday to the late actor:
I never got to say goodbye to him. And we were estranged for 30 years. I never talked to him until one month before he died. He called me out of the blue and said, 'Hey babe, why don't we do something together?' So we were looking for a project, and then I get a call that he died. So I danced that dance because I didn't get to say goodbye. It made me very emotional. I loved him.
Somers also talked with HuffPost Live about being ousted from ""Three's Company"" more than three decades ago. After her termination, Somers said she ""couldn't get a job in television,"" which motivated her to switch career paths and build a fitness empire by selling millions of ThighMasters.
""My show was No. 1, and my demographics were the highest of any woman in television at that time. That's how the ThighMaster happened after I got kicked off … It was my revenge,"" she told host Nancy Redd.

79,COMEDY,Taco Bell Delivery Is What Killed The Dinosaurs,Aaron Nemo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/taco-bell-delivery-is-what-killed-the-dinosaurs_us_559e9678e4b05b1d028fd3db,The catastrophic event that wiped out dinosaurs is back.,2015-07-09,ENTERTAINMENT,"Paleontologists have made a groundbreaking discovery that provides definitive evidence as to what caused the mass extinction of dinosaurs some 66 million years ago. Postulated theories of extraterrestrial impact, volcanism and marine regression are being jettisoned for a much different explanation: the Crunchwrap Supreme.
 Recently uncovered fossils from the late Mesozoic Era indicate that the final generations of dinosaurs maintained a tortilla-heavy diet, rarely left home, and possessed no dignity or self-control. The remains of these once-obese reptilians were excavated from soil rich in marijuana paraphernalia. 
The only logical conclusion? Taco Bell delivery.
Paleontologists say that coprolites, or fossilized feces, suggest that carnivorous dinosaurs preyed primarily on Grilled Steak Taquitos, while omnivorous dinosaurs shamefully feasted alone on Cinnamon Twists. These unwholesome meals became more widely accessible during the Cretaceous period when Taco Bell implemented the delivery services of a tech company called Pterodactyl.
With this new evidence, the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event has been officially renamed FourthMeal. There were multiple near-extinction events that preceded FourthMeal, including the introduction of Pizza Hut Hot Dog Bites in the Jurassic period, as well as the devastating Triassic Baconator plague. 
This week Taco Bell announced plans to test delivery service, this time for humans. Paleontologists fear that this could result in another species wipeout. We should, however, consider that modern-day Taco Bells operate much differently than their prehistoric counterparts. For instance, prehistoric Taco Bells used meat from animals that no longer exist; i.e. Eozostrodon, Deltatheridium, and Jeholodens. Today Taco Bell serves food prepared with more evolved mammals, like horses.
Bottom line: Before you download the app, remember that Taco Bell's delivery service caused the dinosaurs to Live No Más.

80,GREEN,9 Gorgeous Houses That Prove Your Dream Home Is Also A Green Home,Jonathan Feldman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/green-building-home-technology_n_5642395.html,,2014-08-08,ENVIRONMENT,"What is sustainability, and what would it look like in your own home? There are a lot of things you can do to reduce your carbon footprint, like going vegetarian or driving an electric car, but chances are your house maybe be having a larger impact on the environment than you'd like. 
Almost half of the energy your home consumes comes from heating and air conditioning. Unless your house is completely coated in solar panels, more than half of the electricity you're using is probably generated from coal, gas and oil. 
""Green building"" is an effort to curb the environmental toll of inefficient homes, and it's taking hold in the construction sector. The Huffington Post reached out to nine architects to talk about their stunning projects that are not only sustainable, but beautiful too.
1. This beautiful butterfly alights on the California hills -- and saves you water.  Spreading its wings out over the hills of Northern California, Feldman Architecture's Butterfly House thrusts its owners into the drama of its perch. Not only is the house itself beautiful, but looking out its wall of completely open windows its hard not to be overcome by the drama of the view, says principal architect Jonathan Feldman*. 
""When the clouds go over [the hills] or the fog rolls in, they suddenly become these really cool, exciting personalities that people are living through,"" Feldman told The Huffington Post. ""It’s cool to have a nice photograph on your wall but these guys are immersed in that landscape every day of the year.""
The shape of the roof allowed Feldman and his team to incorporate something that he is most excited about: rainwater collection. With California's recent drought strengthening its grip on residents, rainwater collectors can be assets for people willing to spend a little bit more money. ""The long view is worth considering,"" Feldman said. 
In the long run, strategizing how a house uses water -- including used water -- can significantly reduce the pressure a home puts on the environment. ""People need to take this water shortage way more seriously,"" Feldman said, but added that other projects are showing new possibilities. ""We have urban projects where we’re using all the shower water and laundry water to flush the toilets and water the landscapes. That’s something I’m super excited about.""
*The architect Jonathan Feldman is not related to the author of this story, also named Jonathan Feldman.
 
2. Recycling has never looked this good.  Situated on Orcas Island in Washington, architect Gary Gladwish's Eagle Ridge Residence emphasizes the use of recyclable materials. ""I don't rule something out just because it's used,"" Gladwish told HuffPost. ""Some of the appliances, the fireplace, all of the wood siding, the material for the bathroom counters, all of that was used, upcycled or recycled material.""
The Eagle Ridge Residence also uses structural insulated panels, which can cut down on waste and costs considerably. The panels save time in construction, produce less waste on the site and save money in energy costs, since less heat is escaping the structure. 
""The waste stream in this country is greatly contributed to by construction,"" Gladwish said. In building the home, all the waste generated by its construction was taken off site in five loads in an SUV. According to the project's description, the majority of this waste was recyclable as well. 
 
3. A little positioning can make spending on heating and air conditioning a thing of the past.  Los Angeles's Manifold House takes advantage of southern California's year-round warm climate to control the home's temperature. Using strategic positioning and careful planning of the home's indoor shapes, architect Aaron Neubert and his team from ANX push toward ""passive"" solutions to keep their buildings naturally cool. 
What really interests Neubert is how knowledge of passive ventilation has fundamentally changed the design process. ""If you're bringing fresh air through plant material or over water, it increases the cooling of the space, and the question becomes how do you make that beautiful?"" he told HuffPost. ""It becomes interesting, because you're not just talking about aesthetics with the client, you're talking about performance."" 
In the Manifold House, windows and vents within the home can help keep the house at the desired temperature. This precise tuning of the air channels in the house completely removes the need for typical air conditioning systems.
 
4. Solar panels can be easy on your eyes -- and your wallet.  In Menlo Park, California, the Low/Rise House uses an electrifying approach to keep the house very low-carbon: an array of solar panels. Hidden from view along the home's flat roof surfaces, the array reduces the overall energy demand of the house significantly. The house is also positioned to remove the need for air conditioning during the day, even when it gets to be hotter than 100 degrees. Together, there is almost no draw on the grid for power.
""In order for green building to be successful, sustainability shouldn't be obvious, it should be an integral part of your design,"" principal architect Dan Spiegel of the Spiegel Aihara Worshop told HuffPost. Even though the solar panels are nearly invisible, they will provide the house with almost all its power, and pay themselves back in less than five years. 
To keep the house tightly insulated, the solar panels aren't bolted to the roof. No holes are drilled through the building envelope; instead, ballasts keep the solar panels in place and ensure that if the solar array ever needs to be adjusted, the roof will not be needlessly damaged.
 
5. What could be better than a house on Martha's Vineyard? A house MADE OF Martha's Vineyard.  Driving through a grove of trees and a meadow on Martha's Vineyard, you'll come across what architect Peter Rose calls ""good behavior in a precious landscape."" The Island House by Peter Rose + Partners in Edgartown, Massachusetts is a green vacation home for a family of five that does its best to have a low impact on the island.
""The house is almost invisible, and much smaller than the house it replaced,"" Rose told HuffPost. What gives the house its cloak of invisibility is its wood siding, made of unfinished wood that weathers naturally over time, and a green roof, populated by local sea grasses. The roof collects water into a cistern, irrigates the land around the house and keeps the house independent in terms of its water use.
""Martha's Vineyard is one of the most precious, beautiful places in this world,"" Rose said. When designing the home, providing the owners with the opportunity to experience the location was key. Passive cooling keeps the temperature stable, even when letting the outside in. ""When the windows open up, you drift into a beautiful landscape."" 
 
6. With a bit of planning, you can build a normal sized house with 30 percent fewer trees.  ""Getting a building right, so it endures, is the first step,"" SHED Architecture & Design's Thomas Schaer said about the construction of the Main Street House in Seattle, Washington. The house uses advanced framing and a bit of extra planning to significantly cut down on its material usage and costs. 
""In standard framing, you don't need to align your studs, and there's so much extra wood, it's almost idiot proof,"" Schaer said in an interview with HuffPost. ""But with advanced framing, with extra care and planning, you can use 30 percent less of everything."" Advanced framing also prevents the transfer of heat from the interior to the exterior, creating more insulation, which keeps the house's temperature more steady. 
Requiring less materials then means requiring less lumber for construction. Areas the size of Panama are cut down every year for wood and paper products, and advanced framing can be a driving force for reducing our demand for wood. Schaer says that this is a common practice in Canada, but the United States has been slow to move away from standard framing.
 
7. Get rid of your heating and air conditioning and replace it with...concrete?  To architect Ted Cameron of DeForest Architects, sustainability is more than being fashionable in looking for solutions; true progress is made in designs that have more than just ""green lipstick on."" His Courtyard House, situated on Lake Washington in Seattle, is certainly fashionable, but its structure is what makes it so green.
Much of the Courtyard House's structure is made of concrete, which uses radiant heating to keep the house's temperature regulated. ""The radiant floor of the house evens out the spiking of temperature,"" Cameron said. The home faces the sun and absorbs heat during the day, and then uses its stored heat to stay comfortable at night. ""The house cools down at night and stays cool at night,"" even without an air conditioning system.
""There is a trend to return to modernism now, but green building won't fall out of favor,"" Cameron said. ""Resources and fossil fuels can't just be wasted anymore.""
 
8. Don't sacrifice; you can still live large even if you build small.  Large homes are a symbol of status in the United States, but architect Craig Steely asks, ""Do you really need to build that big?"" Lavaflow 5, overlooking the Pacific Ocean on the island of Hawaii, is remarkably small. At 1,100 square feet, it provides a comfortable home that uses as much energy as it generates. 
By stripping away extraneous materials and space, the footprint of construction becomes much smaller. ""I've always been inspired by how good buildings look before they're finished,"" Steely said in a phone interview. ""They look compelling, powerful and strong; but then they become covered, clad, buried and killed in layers of requirement."" Steely's skeletal structure is all ""sharp and bones,"" which affords less space for rot and mold to grow.
The small frame and roof of the house were prefabricated in San Francisco and shipped to Hawaii, where they were assembled in five days. The house also uses passive cooling to keep the house at a comfortable temperature and a solar heating system to provide the home with hot water without the need for gas. 
 
9. Seal your envelope tight and heat your home with a hair dryer.  ""This house is a vision of how things should be. Energy and water are two of our top priorities,"" said Joe Giampietro of NK Architects. ""If you're building any other way, your house is outdated as soon as its done,"" builder Sloan Ritchie agreed. The Park Passive House in Seattle, designed by NK's Marie Ljubojevic and Lauren McCunney, has cut its energy consumption by 90 percent thanks to the careful design of the architect and builder.
""We really try to balance with the environment,"" Giampietro told HuffPost. Part of what helps the house conserve energy so effectively is its tight envelope; the envelope prevents the outside temperature from affecting the inside temperature when all the windows and doors are closed and allows heat to spread through the house easily. ""Theoretically, the net energy needs of the house can be met by a small heat source, like a hair dryer,"" he said.
Jennifer Ritchie is the wife of Sloan Ritchie, and together they live in the home comfortably. Ms. Ritchie, accustomed to her previous home, had difficulty managing all the captured heat at first, but quickly learned how to keep the house cool all day. ""I owned a 1912 Craftsman home that had been ordered out of a Sears catalog that wasn't even insulated,"" she said. ""With the multi-locking windows and insulation, it makes things really quiet and it reduces our electricity and gas bills significantly.""

81,ENVIRONMENT,Belinda Carlisle On PETA Ad With Go-Go's Bandmates: 'It Was Clever And Would Get People Talking',,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/belinda-carlisle-peta-go-gos_us_5bb13bb0e4b09bbe9a5ce124,"Before the gals kick off their summer 2013 tour, we chatted with vegetarian frontwoman Belinda Carlisle about her passion",2013-06-08,ENVIRONMENT,"From PETA:
The Go-Go's were the first all-female band to hit number one writing their own music and playing their own instruments. They were also the first stars to pose for PETA's iconic ""Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur"" campaign.
Before the gals kick off their summer 2013 tour, we chatted with vegetarian frontwoman Belinda Carlisle about her passion for animals, her historic work with PETA, and even her favorite foods.

PETA: The Go-Go's starred in PETA's very first naked ad. The ""Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur"" campaign has since become iconic around the world. Did you have any feeling when you did it that it would redefine the movement, keep animal rights sexy and relevant for decades, and transcend cultures?
Belinda Carlisle: We had no idea at the time that the campaign would be so iconic. We knew it was clever and would get people talking. The campaign is still just as relevant, since fur still unfortunately lines the runways. Everyone loves the campaign, including my son, who's 21. And I always get asked if we were really naked behind that sign!
PETA: Well, were you?
B.C.: I'll never tell!
PETA: So tell us how you ended up so committed to living meat-free. You were vegetarian, and then you fell off the wagon for a bit, but you came back for animals. What made you recommit to a vegetarian diet?
B.C.: I fell off the vegetarian wagon and never felt good about it. I wouldn't let myself think of my plate of meat as an animal, but I knew deep inside it was, and actually it was gross, especially chicken. I was full of shame. Then I started practicing yoga, which is all about nonviolence, and realized eating meat isn't compatible with that. Now I teach yoga, and I'm so full of pride not to support factory farms and to be socially responsible.
PETA: That's great! For people reading this who would like to go meat-free but don't know where to start, what are some of your favorite vegan foods? 
B.C.: Vegan Sloppy Joes, vegan BLTs, and hummus—anything that doesn't leave a bloody aftertaste.
Catch the Go-Go's live this summer.

82,GREEN,"This Adorable Baby Sea Lion Needed Help, So It Hopped On A Surf Board",Arin Greenwood,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sea-lion-surfing_n_5654161.html,,2014-08-06,ENVIRONMENT,"Stephanie Schechter was having a pretty ordinary spring day, up until a sea lion pup jumped up onto her surfboard.
It was early April, and after class at the University of California, Santa Barbara, the student and model grabbed her longboard, which is painted to look like a watermelon, and headed to the stretch of beach behind campus. 
It's pretty common for Schechter to see a variety of animals while surfing there -- like dolphins, which ""get so close to the surfers that they brush beneath our feet,"" she says. ""When the water is clear, I can see beautiful fish, rays, and sharks -- usually the kind that don't bite. One of the most breathtaking sights is to watch migrating whales pass through, but usually they're pretty far out to sea."" 
It's not even that odd to see seals and sea lions. ""But it is rare for them to hop up on boards!"" says Schechter.

This one didn't just hop up. The pup, which may have been abandoned by its mother and was in need of care, snuggled up close.
""I knew she must have been unwell, because she was quite a young pup to be away from her mother, but she didn’t seem injured or sick! I coaxed her back into the water but she hopped right back onto my board, cuddling and nuzzling up to me, as if I was her mother,"" Schechter wrote in a blog post for Swell.com about the encounter. ""A young boy and his father saw me, and paddled out. They too were excited, and the boy even asked me, 'are you a mermaid?!' They were also kind enough to use my camera to take a picture of me with the pup (my selfie attempts weren’t working out so well)! When the young boy paddled up to my board, approaching the pup, she growled at him, and waddled over to me for safety. The boy and his father went in to look for help, but no one of authority was around!""

After a couple hours, Schechter contacted Paul Stark, a sea lion authority with the Santa Barbara Marine Mammal Center, who was able to come by and collect the pup. Schechter was, by then, calling the little grey animal Winifred the Pinniped.
Stark brought Winifred in for a month's worth of rehabilitation, before releasing Winifred back into the ocean. He tells The Huffington Post that it's actually fairly common for sea lions to ""hang out on anything that floats,"" especially if they are young, abandoned by their mothers and malnourished like Winifred was. 
This year, animal care experts along the Pacific Ocean in California have seen a spike in the number of ailing seals and sea lion pups, and they're not completely sure what the cause is. Stark says his group has rescued almost 300 marine mammals so far this year. 
Several weeks after meeting Winifred, Schechter herself even helped save another sea lion. 
""I was going for a run on the beach before class. I came across another tiny sea lion sitting on some rocks,"" she says. ""I saw that this pup was even thinner than Winifred, so I figured it was in the same situation, abandoned and starving. I called up the marine mammal center once again and actually got to assist in helping to load the pup into the truck!""
Stark cautions that it's important not to be seduced into thinking that anyone could just move to California and take up surfing, with the dream of finding a personal sea lion buddy. The adorable-looking animals can be ""bitey and dangerous,"" he says, adding that Schechter was ""lucky she wasn't bitten.""
Schechter does indeed feel lucky. 
""I have always been a huge animal lover, so being able to form a special connection with an amazing marine mammal really touched me,"" she says. ""Being able to help a sea animal in need allowed me to give back to the place I love the most: the ocean. This was absolutely the most incredible and special event that I have ever experienced.""

84,GREEN,Another Fox In The Henhouse: Coal Lobbyist Tapped For Top Spot In Trump’s EPA,"Mary Anne Hitt, ContributorDirector of the Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/another-fox-in-the-henhouse-coal-lobbyist-tapped-for_us_5978ec8ae4b09982b73761ab,"In a move that will probably surprise no one, but should dismay everyone who breathes air and drinks water, recent reports",2017-07-26,ENVIRONMENT,"In a move that will probably surprise no one, but should dismay everyone who breathes air and drinks water, recent reports indicate Donald Trump will nominate former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler to serve as deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Wheeler was not only a key D.C. advocate for the coal industry, but also used to be an aide for everyone’s “favorite” climate-denying senator, James Inhofe.
Wheeler doesn’t believe in climate disruption, which means he’ll be at home in Pruitt’s agency as it moves forward with the plan to try and cast doubt on climate science. As recently exposed in the press, the red team, blue team exercise Pruitt wants to hold to “debate” climate science has been advised by the fossil-fuel-funded staff at the Heartland Institute, a fringe group notorious for its highly controversial tactics to undermine climate action.
Just take that in for a minute - the safety of our drinking water, the air our kids breathe, and even our climate, will be in the hands of a top lobbyist for an industry that has worked relentlessly, for decades, to burn those very protections to the ground. This continues a string of bad and dangerous decisions by Trump and EPA head Scott Pruitt, as they continue to roll back clean air and water standards and let the fossil fuel industry pad its bottom line at the expense of public health. 
From delaying methane pollution protections to attempting to roll back standards that protect our waterways from coal pollution, Trump and Pruitt are clearly forgetting what the “P” in EPA stands for: PROTECTION.
Thankfully, the Sierra Club and allied environmental organizations and activists nationwide are doing everything possible to stop these rollbacks. Even former EPA staff are leading a charge to protect the agency’s mission via a group called “Save EPA.” They’ve created a toolkit called “A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump De-Regulatory Agenda” that’s designed as a guidebook for regular Americans who want to defend EPA and oppose environmental rollbacks - I highly recommend you check it out. They’re empowering people on the ground in cities,towns, and rural communities everywhere to take action on their own to save the EPA from fossil fuel cronies.
As long as Pruitt and Trump try to undermine our public health and environmental standards, moms, dads, doctors, scientists, faith leaders, businesses owners, teachers, and so many others will be there to oppose those dangerous decisions.

I recently had a conversation with some friends about Arianna's new book, Thrive, and the zeitgeist of today. I do agree that Western societies are at an inflection point -- that we are experiencing a collective wake-up call about the deeper meaning of our lives and social purpose of our organizations outside of material success.
A few nights ago, my friend Julien and I had an extraordinary experience that aligns with these conversations that we wanted to share. We came upon a distressing scene on the cascading street steps in front of our little rental house in Mykonos: A woman was weeping and crying out in Italian next to a grey-white stray cat that was sprawled out in a pool of blood struggling to live.
More than a dozen people emerged speaking a cacophony of languages grasping for ways to save the cat. So, we focused on finding a Greek person from the island who could help. 
Just at that moment, a friendly merchant appeared. He explained it was the day of the Ascension and no clinic would be open. But the assembly of neighbors would not yield. After exhausting almost all the options, the merchant called and found one vet willing to open his clinic.
With a local waitress on a motorcycle to guide our jeep, we raced the cat -- that the assembly had bundled in a box -- to the clinic. We meditated and soothed him, encouraging the cat to stay with us. He shot back innocent sparkles from his eyes.
When we arrived, Kostas, the vet, was waiting in his clinic beaming light from atop a hill overlooking the town. Kostas found in the little cat a deep stab wound from a knife still gushing blood. (We have since learned there are adolescent boys who taunt cats in the neighborhood.) With no staff at hand, I assisted the operation for one hour as we stitched the inner muscle and then the pelt of the cat.
The cat survived and we were thrilled. We tucked him into bed at 10 p.m. only to learn the following morning that he may not be able to walk. Julien has named the cat Odysseus, and we are hoping to learn in a few days that he can continue to survive the voyage.
In light of some of the reflections we had been sharing together with some friends a week before this incident, I have been pondering the meaning of it all.
One message is clear: The endgame of cruelty need not prevail; collective human compassion and intelligence can overcome it. Still, it takes an outpouring of kindness to overcome one act of cruelty and it takes believing that the first can trump the second.
No matter the trauma that Odysseus endured, he never exhibited fear of the assembly of neighbors. Just the opposite -- he seemed to believe that it was the first that can prevail in humans.

86,GREEN,Judge Rejects $2.4 Million Fine For Oil Company Over Blast That Killed 7,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tesoro-anacortes-explosion-fine_us_59398e1fe4b0c5a35c9d50cf,State officials had said the Tesoro Anacortes refinery explosion was the oil company's fault.,2017-06-11,ENVIRONMENT,"A state appeals judge has rejected a $2.4 million dollar fine for an oil company after a refinery explosion killed seven workers.
State officials imposed the fine on Texas company Tesoro in October 2010, over a blast in Anacortes, Washington, that occurred April that year. It was the largest workplace-safety fine in Washington state history, local NPR member station KUOW reports.
But late last week, Judge Mark Jaffe of the Washington State Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals overturned the fine, saying the state had not shown that the deadly explosion was Tesoro’s fault. The company had been appealing the fine for years — though it did pay millions of dollars to the families of the victims.
The local news website, GoSkagit.com, reports that Jaffe’s ruling must still be approved by the board.
The explosion occurred at the Tesoro’s Anacortes refinery when a heat exchanger ruptured. The rupture released extremely hot hydrogen and naphtha, which ignited. The ensuing explosion was so intense that many people felt a shock wave across the nearby Fidalgo Bay, and a huge fireball shot into the sky over the refinery, the Seattle Times reported at the time. (The outlet’s report was published before the final death toll.)
Seven workers — Daniel Aldridge, Matt Bowen, Matt Gumbel, Darrin Hoines, Lew Janz, Kathryn Powell and Donna Van Dreumel — died from injuries sustained in the blast, according to KUOW.
The state’s Department of Labor and Industries accused Tesoro of dozens of violations that contributed to the explosion, and these alleged violations led to officials handing down the $2.4 million fine.
“Our position has been that had Tesoro conducted the appropriate and required testing, they would have found the cracking that led to the rupture,” department spokesman Hector Castro told Reuters in 2011.
But Judge Jaffe wrote in his ruling on Thursday that the state was “unable to really articulate what Tesoro did or did not do to cause the explosion.”
The Washington Department of Labor and Industries, however, is not the only group that has blamed the company for the disaster.
The U.S. Chemical Safety Board said in 2011 that Tesoro inadequately maintained the heat exchanger that exploded, Reuters reported at the time. The CSB released its final report on the catastrophe in 2014, citing a “substandard safety culture at Tesoro, which led to a complacent attitude toward flammable leaks and occasional fires over the year.”
The company has repeatedly asserted it was not at fault for the explosion and that its heat exchanger maintenance was in line with industry standards and regulations.
Tesoro spokesman Matt Gill told GoSkagit.com that the company supported Judge Jaffe’s decision.

Here’s the good news: According to the wonks at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute, the average car sold in March was 25.4 mpg, a new record. In truth, fuel economy has been improving all year — it’s up 0.4 percent since January.  Aha, you say, the sunny skies will yield to clouds — if people get better fuel economy (or even buy electric cars), they’ll drive more. It’s human nature; people travel more when it’s less painful to them.  David Owen wrote about this in the New Yorker. Give people Energy Star air-conditioners and they’ll just turn them on more. Owen calls it the Jevons Paradox: ""This effect is usually referred to as ‘rebound’ — or, in cases where increased consumption more than cancels out any energy savings, as ‘backfire,’” he wrote.
But Matt Mattila of the Rocky Mountain Institute denies that factor is at work with drivers because most don’t even know their fuel economy. And even if they did, they’re unlikely to take advantage of it by covering more miles. You might be better off saying that because Americans are heavier, they're hurting fuel economy gains. (That one's true.)  The University of California Transportation Center says it measured this “rebound effect” back in 2007 and discovered “that it is not large. Moreover, we find that it has become smaller over time, and is likely to become smaller still. This means that improved fuel efficiency does translate into lower fuel consumption.”  And guess what? Actual vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and fuel consumed continues to fall, despite population growth and the supposed backlash everybody’s worried about. The absolute amount of fuel consumed by American cars and trucks fell 11 percent between 2004 (when fuel use hit a peak) and the end of 2012.  Americans are driving less and using less fuel. The rates for 2012 distance driven roughly mirror the mid-1990s, and the fuel consumed is lower than in 1984 (when the University of Michigan’s figures begin).  Michigan’s Michael Sivak admits there’s some truth to the rebound effect: “Having more efficient vehicles will lead to an increase in driving,” he said. “But the general consensus is that only about 10 percent of the gain in fuel economy is effectively lost due to an increase in driving. In other words, 90 percent of the gain in fuel economy is retained — not compensated for by increased driving.”  So go ahead and buy that Prius or Nissan Leaf. Here are some great choices for fuel-efficient used cars. You’re not likely to drive it much more than your current car.

88,GREEN,"Cruelty is Cruelty, Any Way You Slice It","Kathy Stevens, ContributorFounder and director, Catskill Animal Sanctuary",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chickens-cows-cats-and-do_b_5929814.html,,2014-10-08,ENVIRONMENT,"While generally not considered newsworthy, chickens have recently been in the spotlight. First, chickens made the news around the world as orthodox Jewish communities practiced the ritual of Kapparot -- a Yom Kippur tradition of swinging a live chicken over ""the sinner's"" head and then slaughtering it. Chicken brutality in Fresno, California also made headlines, when close to 1,000 chickens were bludgeoned to death by four teenagers who broke into a farm. 
""What a bad week to be a chicken,"" you might have thought. 
Friends, it is always a bad week to be a chicken. 
It is human nature to reel against heinous and purposeful cruelty. For instance, the story of a Brooklyn man who kicked a cat while being filmed recently went viral, as did the infamous Michael Vick dog fighting scandal. We Americans have little tolerance for deliberate cruelty, so the media attention received by the bludgeoned chickens is not surprising. But the elephant in the room in this story is this: our eating habits support cruelty that is every bit as savage and barbaric as bludgeoning animals with golf clubs.
One could certainly make an argument that those clubbed chickens met a fate no crueler than the one they were bound to face. Every year, 9 billion chickens suffer horrendously on factory farms so that we can eat them. ""Broilers"" are bred to grow so large and so fast that they can barely stand or move around -- doing so causes tremendous pain. During their short, painful lives, these birds live in cramped warehouses and never see daylight. At the end of their 47-day life, they are sent to the slaughterhouse where, among other horrors, millions are boiled alive every year as they miss the neck slicer and are submerged, completely conscious, into a water bath meant to remove their feathers. Sounds just as painful as being clubbed to death to me. 
  Consider this:
300 million hens in the U.S. are kept in ""battery cages,"" tiny cages shared with up to 11 birds in which each bird gets less room than a standard 8.5x11 inch sheet of paper. Their beaks are seared off with a hot blade, without anesthetic, so that they cannot peck at each other in the confined space. 
In the U.S. alone, over 8 million ""dairy cows"" live on factory farms. Dairy cows' tails and horns are cut off without anesthesia. Female cows also often suffer from a painful condition called mastitis, an infection that causes cows' udders to swell. On top of it all, cows are kept in a constant cycle of impregnation and birth in order to make milk, and suffer the emotional toll of losing their babies -- male calves become veal and females become dairy cows -- just moments after birth. 
These are just two examples of the cruelty inflicted by our food choices. As we judge those who inflict intentional harm, I urge us to turn our judgement inward, too--to face the truth that that each of us, through the simple practice of eating, supports infinitely greater harm to an infinitely greater number of non-human animals than all of the animal cruelty stories that made their way into the news last week.
In just a few days, Catskill Animal Sanctuary will host its 13th Annual Shindig -- a celebration of compassionate living. At Shindig, you can see farmed animals thriving as all animals should. At Shindig, you can taste delicious vegan food. At Shindig, the solution to farmed animal cruelty is clear: we must go vegan. 
I believe we humans are compassionate. Many of us still don't know the harm we are causing. Take the first step towards compassionate living and visit CASanctuary.org to learn more about transitioning to a vegan diet. Better yet, if you're in the area, come to this year's Shindig, visit us any weekend May-November for a tour, or stay at our beautiful Homestead, now open year round! 
Whether an animal meets his end with the blow of a club or the slice of blade, causing death is a cruel act. Chose compassion instead today.

* Tripling of groundwater use raises reserve fears
* 6th World Water Forum starts in Marseille on Monday
By Gus Trompiz
PARIS, March 12 (Reuters) - The world's water supply is being strained by climate change and the growing food, energy and sanitary needs of a fast-growing population, according to a United Nations study that calls for a radical rethink of policies to manage competing claims.
""Freshwater is not being used sustainably,"" UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova said in a statement. ""Accurate information remains disparate, and management is fragmented ... the future is increasingly uncertain and risks are set to deepen.""
It says that demand from agriculture, which already sucks up around 70 percent of freshwater used globally, is likely to rise by at least 19 percent by 2050 as the world's population swells an estimated 2 billion people to 9 billion.
Farmers will need to grow 70 percent more food by that time as rising living standards mean individuals demand more food, and meat in particular.
The report will be debated at the World Water Forum, which starts in the French city of Marseille on Monday.
A ""silent revolution"" has taken place underground, the report warns, as the amount of water sucked from below the surface has tripled in the past 50 years, removing a buffer against drought.
And just as demand increases, supply in many regions is likely to shrink because of changed rainfall patterns, greater droughts, melting glaciers and altered river flows, it says.
""Climate change will drastically affect food production in South Asia and Southern Africa between now and 2030,"" the report says. ""By 2070, water stress will also be felt in central and southern Europe.""
Asia is home to 60 percent of the world's population but only around a third of water resources, it points out.
A separate water study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) released last week forecast world water demand would rise by 55 percent by 2050, with more than 40 percent of the global population likely to live in water basins facing water stress.
The report says with limited supply, policymakers will have to better manage the competing demands of farmers, energy producers and humans demanding drinking water and sanitation.
""The lack of interaction between the diverse communities of users, decision makers and isolated water managers has caused serious degradation of the water resource,"" it says.
The World Health Organisation said last week the U.N. target to raise the proportion of people with access to safe drinking water by 2015 had actually been reached at the end of 2010.
However the figure was contested by French charity Solidarites International, which said 1.9 billion people remained without safe drinking water, not the 783 million estimated by the United Nations.
The charity is among groups planning to challenge official messages at the Forum, with some associations holding an alternative event in Marseille. (Additional reporting by Jean-Francois Rosnoblet; Editing by Ben Harding)

They can go to the website and create a local food event and it will be in our global event listings for the public to attend. It can be an event for five people or for 50, and the more creative the better. We hope that this will inspire future projects at a grassroots level and connect neighbors who can support each other in standing up for real food,” Oliver says. “The other way that people can get involved is to host their own dinner party. There will be people in over 45 countries around the world hosting their own dinner parties in support of food education.”  For Oliver, who sums up his food philosophy as “Better food, better life,” has made it his life’s mission “to get people to eat real food, made from scratch. I believe — and research has shown — that by eating a diet of real food (meats and vegetables, carbohydrates and the occasional treat) that you cook for yourself and your family will make you a healthier person. When I look around the world at the rising rates of obesity and diet-related disease, I am saddened and angered because this is entirely preventable. People just need food education and a few cooking skills.”  He’s proud that his television programs and campaign initiatives have produced tangible results and inspired people to make changes in their lives.  “After ‘Jamie’s School Dinners’ aired in the U.K., the people petitioned the government to serve better food to our children and they actually listened and voted more than $500 million into the system. In America, after the ‘Food Revolution’ aired, we inspired people to petition against flavored milk and pink slime in our schools, which not only got the USDA to change the regulations around flavored milk, but led fast-food companies and grocery stores to stop selling pink slime.”  Although he encountered bureaucratic red tape and resistance while making “Food Revolution,” he nevertheless considers it a win. “Just getting the ‘Food Revolution’ series on national prime time television was an accomplishment, but then to have the entire town of Huntington [West Virginia] transform and getting Los Angeles on the journey is a huge deal. We've started a national dialog around food issues that many more people in America are participating in part because of exposure to our shows and campaigns. And winning an Emmy was pretty cool, too.”  Currently, Oliver is running a restaurant empire that includes “Three Fifteens, one Barbecoa next to St. Paul’s Cathedral in London, two Union Jacks with Chris Bianco, and 31 Jamie’s Italians, which I hope to bring to the USA at some point.” His latest print effort is the U.S. version of “Jamie’s Great Britain,” due out in October. “It is my love letter to British food, and I am hoping after everyone falls in love with the country after the Summer Olympics that they will want to give the food a try too,” he says.   As a father of four, Oliver keeps the food he serves at home and at his restaurants local, sustainable and impeccably sourced. “A lot of what we eat at home comes straight from the garden so that helps, particularly from this time of year right through until Christmas when there's plenty to harvest. As for the restaurants, we source everything very carefully so we know all about the food provenance. We go to all the farms to check on the animal welfare and we always use higher welfare chicken, for example.”  Looking ahead, he plans to “keep doing what I’m doing, raising my family, writing books, making telly, and making noise around issues that I believe in,” Oliver says. He has a simple solution for improving the food situation, and it starts with us. “Demand better,” he says. “More fresh, less processed. More access to good fresh food and food education so that the lovely people at home actually know what to do with a fresh vegetable.”  Get inspired: Learn about others who are making a difference with MNN's Innovation Generation project.

But the Kentucky Coal Mining Museum in Benham is installing solar panels on its roof to cut energy costs, reports local CBS news station WYMT.
The building is owned by Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College. The move has been described as “a little ironic” by the college’s communications director, Brandon Robinson, and by former state Rep. Roger Noe.
The Associated Press wondered if it was merely “a sign of our times.”
Robinson told WYMT that the college expects to save $8,000 to $10,000 a year on energy costs.
According to a town website, Benham, in Harlan County, Kentucky, describes itself as “the little town that International Harvester, coal miners and their families built!”
A former coal camp town, Benham once had a population of 3,000, according to the Associated Press, and now has about 500 residents.
The museum is dedicated to “the life of a coal miner and his family as they struggled to make a life for themselves not knowing how valuable their contributions were to the industrialization of the 20th century.”

Those, on the other hand",2013-09-02,ENVIRONMENT,"One of the daily privileges of living in southern California along the Santa Monica Bay is watching pods of bottlenose dolphins patrolling the coastline. They are extraordinary creatures with astounding memories that bring joy to my day - each time I see them.  My students and I believe that dolphins are entitled to the right of life. We along with millions of other Earthlings are mortified that Japan and Faroe Islanders brutally slaughter small-toothed whales and dolphins i.e. Faroe Islands and Taiji Cove with such reckless abandon and a despicable sense of entitlement.
Those unfortunate dolphins not slaughtered but caught are sentenced to an unimaginable captivity - suffering a brutal and torturous existence in dolphinariums for the amusement of unconscious humans. Have you seen the documentary Blackfish?
Since July 1, my colleagues and I have witnessed bottlenose dolphins dying along the eastern seaboard from New York to the Carolina's (and soon predicted along Florida) at ten times the normal death rates, washing ashore emaciated, shark bitten with shocking skin lesions. So far over 375 have perished with predictions suggesting casualties will at least double before a morbillivirus, which is implicated in their deaths, abates.
In addition, it is worrisome that polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs are showing up in high concentrations off-coast Georgia. Although banned in the U.S. since 1979 they remain at manufacturing sites bleeding carcinogenic toxicity into soils and waterways for many decades. 
The truth of the matter is that our oceans are desperately sick; my forthcoming book 'Shepherding the Sea' delves into many of those details. In the meantime, dolphins and whales are in big trouble - naval and oil exploration sonar are shattering their eardrums, cargo ships are ramming them, 13 million miles or 27 return trips to the moon of hooked and monofilament fishing lines are ensnaring them or cutting them badly, their autoimmune systems are so over-compromised from mercury poisoning (a by-product of coal-fired power plants) and toxic micro-plastics acting as sponges laced with high concentrations of potent man-made poisons; these awesome sea creatures are now susceptible to many viruses whereby pneumonia sets in, quickly.
My colleagues have clearly shown that both filter feeding whales e.g. humpbacks and large- and small-toothed whales (i.e. dolphins) play an essential role in keeping the web of sealife intact and vibrant. The filter feeders fertilize the ocean with their nitrogen-rich flocculent fecal plumes, stimulating phytoplankton, enriching the marine ecosystem, and creating abundant fisheries. Toothed whales cull the old and weak fish and seal populations preventing diseases from reaching epidemics and ensuring a high level of fitness throughout the seas.
The Japanese and Faroe Island bloodlust is barbaric and it is fueling the death of the sea - their repugnant sense of entitlement must end, now!
The Japanese government recently called demonstrators in Tokyo 'environmental terrorists' for drawing attention to the beginning of yet another dolphin slaughter season. Shame on them for their incorrigible misuse of the word 'terrorism.'
Those that stand-up for nature and the rights of sealife are intrepid and indeed worthy of praise. Those, on the other hand, that authorize and profit from killing or torturing of nature and the destruction of our living biosphere are perpetrating global crimes against all children and their birthrights on planet Earth.

Some experts, however, are more concerned about the debris we may never see but that might still pose a threat to human health. 
""Over long periods of time, big plastics degrade into smaller and smaller particles, and these may create an additional route of exposure to certain chemical contaminants,"" said Courtney Arthur, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Debris Program.
As sunlight and waves break down plastic materials into pieces the size of fish food, new research suggests that fish may mistakenly eat the so-called microplastics and subsequently absorb chemicals into their bodies. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins, among other toxins, could then travel up the food chain and onto our dinner plates. 
These pollutants have been linked to everything from hormone problems to neurological disorders to cancer in humans.
So far, microplastic debris -- generally defined as particles less than one millimeter wide, or about half the head of a pin -- have turned up in every ocean on the planet, including samples recently collected from Puget Sound, Chesapeake Bay and San Francisco Bay. Species along the entire length of the marine food chain have been found to ingest the tiny particles: sharks, sea turtles and krill, among others. It may not necessarily be the seafood we eat that has consumed the plastic, but rather the marine life in our food's diet. As chemicals move up the food chain, they can accumulate into larger and more toxic concentrations.
Last year, researchers discovered that about 80 percent of the plastic they collected along shorelines was in the form of small particles. Other studies have linked the amount of plastic in the guts of seabirds to the levels of PCBs in their body tissues, and research has found that microplastics fed to mussels can actually relocate from the gut to blood cells. 
""It appears quite likely that contaminants migrate from plastic into the organism,"" said Chelsea Rochman, a doctoral student studying the toxicity of marine plastic debris at the University of California, Davis. She added that it is still too early to say with certainty that the contaminants from microplastics are absorbed by body tissues, but she hopes her research will get closer to an answer. Rochman recently collected fish and water samples in the South Atlantic to measure contaminant levels and is awaiting results. 
Many of the chemicals added to plastics during their manufacture, including flame retardants and bisphenol A, are known to be hazardous. Plastics also attract a ""toilet bowl"" of pesticides, oil and other runoff from land and boats, said Rochman. The smaller the particle, the more relative surface area to soak up PCBs and other contaminants.
""Some plastic particles can have up to a million times as many pollutants stuck on them than are present in ambient sea water,"" said Marcus Eriksen, executive director of the nonprofit 5 Gyres Institute. ""They become a toxic little pill.""
The million-plus tons of plastic estimated to have been added to the oceans by the Japanese tsunami will expand the swirls of plastic rubbish already present by an estimated 10 percent, according to Eriksen. 
Eriksen's 5 Gyres team, along with other marine scientists such as Linda Amaral Zettler of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., are collecting samples from the Western North Pacific Gyre in hopes of determining the fate of plastics from the tsunami debris -- and whether microbes may actually be helping to degrade plastics. Emerging research suggests this is the case, although Amaral Zettler noted that it's not yet clear whether the microbes mobilize potential toxins, making them more harmful, or if they actually keep the toxins from entering the food chain. 
Research into microplastics is still in its very early stages and there is a lot yet to learn. Just how many of the little plastic bits are out there? To what extent do they they threaten marine life and human health? All of these questions are now of personal importance to Eriksen. He and his wife, Anna Cummins, are anticipating the arrival of their first child. 
Cummins, co-founder of 5 Gyres, knows that she can pass on hazardous chemicals to her developing baby. So she is being careful to avoid foods packaged in plastic, and when she does eat fish -- important for a fetus' brain development -- she chooses the smaller varieties that are lower in the food chain, and are therefore less likely to contain high concentrations of pollutants.
""I'm not personally worried about the levels in my body,"" she said. ""But I follow the precautionary principle as a pregnant woman and stay away from the top predators.""

94,GREEN,Serving Local And Organic For The Holidays? It's More Than Just The Fare,"Jena Thompson Meredith, ContributorVice President of Business Partnerships, The Conservation Fund",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/serving-local-and-organic-for-the-holidays-its-more_us_5851dd21e4b0bae8bdcba297,"As millions of Americans take a much-deserved pause to join family and friends during this holiday season, it goes without",2016-12-19,ENVIRONMENT,"As millions of Americans take a much-deserved pause to join family and friends during this holiday season, it goes without saying that our tables will feature traditional homemade recipes passed down through generations. From turkey and ham to vegetarian and vegan dishes, many of us will enjoy sustainably grown and responsibly harvested food from local farms and ranches across the country. By all accounts, “farm to table” is front and center this holiday season.
The local food sector is valued at $12 billion and is growing 9 percent a year. However, our farmers are getting older, and we’re losing family farms to development. Sales of organic products saw double digit growth last year to $43 billion. That’s five percent of all food sales. However, only 1 percent of our land base is certified organic. And it may be too costly for farmers to increase that land base significantly. If we’re to be successful, we need to focus on a system-wide approach that includes land conservation, the farmers and ranchers, and markets. And if we want to really move the needle, we’re going to need leadership from business—and all of us as customers—to help drive change. We need to help address the lack of supply at scale.
Unfortunately, many of our working lands are at risk; small and mid-sized farms are disappearing fast. In the next five years, more than 90 million acres of farmland will be sold because of changing demographics. That’s 10 percent of U.S. farmland up for sale—twice the size of the state of Missouri. Who will buy these farms? Who will grow our food?
Consider the following: A 2015 study by the Farmland Information Center showed that states invested $105 million in one year to protect farm and ranch land but spent $108 billion—about 1,000 times more—on highways. 
In order to protect the farmer, we’ve learned you need to protect the land. And often, that also requires investing in entrepreneurs who can grow the market to keep up with rising demand.
For example, since 1993, The Conservation Fund has provided more than $22 million in bridge financing to local land trusts to conserve 100 family farms. In New England, that equates to 10,000 acres of permanently protected farmland across the Connecticut River Valley. These lands provide fresh fruits and vegetables to Boston Public Market, a 28,000-square foot permanent, year-round indoor market providing only locally-sourced food to the public, the first of its kind in the country. 
On the West Coast, Lundberg Family Farms is a third generation family farm whose motto is simple: “leave the land better than you found it.” 
In the 1930’s Albert Lundberg witnessed the Dustbowl that resulted from poor soil management and short-sighted farming techniques. After moving the family to Northern California’s fertile Sacramento Valley, he impressed upon his four sons the need to care for the soil.
Today, Lundberg Family Farm’s Certified Organic and Eco-Farmed rice is grown with a concern for the environment. In addition to operating a sustainable farm, the company is keenly aware of the connection between working lands, sustainability and its customers.
It’s a recognition that sustainability and common sense need to go hand in hand.
The same thinking must be applied to seafood production. By 2050 we will need to double the global food supply to feed the world’s population. In the U.S., much of our seafood is a far cry from local; more than 90 percent is imported. We need access to high-quality, healthy and locally-sourced seafood so we can provide for our families and put less pressure on our oceans. 
To meet this challenge, The Freshwater Institute is pioneering technology, research and development to redefine fish farming—on land—to provide fresh, locally grown fish. It has developed a sustainable system and fish feed that does not use wild-caught fish meal. Fish are not treated with antibiotics or hormones, and the technology can be used anywhere. 
When it comes to the rise of local and organic food, we can choose to make a change for good. We need to preserve the land that food is grown on, support the farmers and businesses that grow, process, and distribute our food, and strengthen the markets that serve local communities across the country. As we reflect with family and friends during this holiday season, let’s continue to build on this progress so that future generations can enjoy even better access to local, healthy food than we do today.

Greetings! It is a great honor to be given the opportunity to represent Denver Public Schools and Climate Generation: A Will Steger Legacy at the UNFCC COP21 Negotiations in Paris, France. Upon arrival, it was apparent that the city has rolled out the ""green carpet,"" as COP21 occupied high visibility in all parts of the city.
I am attending these historic events as a passionate science educator and concerned citizen who is committed to playing a role in addressing our world's climate crisis. Students in my classroom at Compassion Road Academy in Denver have been preparing to participate virtually in these historic negotiations for months, and I cannot wait to share this experience with them as well as with you.
This is my first-ever blog post, and I am excited that you have taken the time to read through my thoughts and experiences. As I write I am enjoying the accommodations at the Generator Hostel after a very long day of traveling, meeting new people and taking in the beauty of the city. I've been reflecting upon all that has lead to this point in time, in addition to thinking through the magnitude of the decisions that will be made by our world leaders gathered in Paris with me.
During my travels, I found myself questioning all of the choices that we are faced with everyday, which have an impact on our global health. It is challenging to be a 21st century citizen, as we are constantly faced with decisions that directly or indirectly impact our world. Ultimately, this is the goal that I have everyday: as soon as I step into my classroom, I strive to help my students think through the choices they make and consider other ways to live their lives that ultimately have a softer impact on our fragile environment.
World leaders at COP21 are tasked with one of the greatest challenges that our world has ever seen. I desperately want to believe that our political leaders and scientists can come to an agreement that will drastically reduce the amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gases that are being released into the atmosphere and are increasing the global average surface temperature.
The time is now -- action must be taken. We can no longer turn our heads away from science. The evidence is clear -- human activity is causing the climate to change on a time scale that has never before been seen. As much as I would like to say that I am optimistic that action will be taken and that our leaders will implement sweeping reforms, I am worried, for multiple reasons.
I believe that our leaders are going to continue to walk the line on climate change, and that true change is going to come only when all the world's communities join together to demand that more serious actions are taken. We are more powerful together, and it is my hope that the UNFCC COP21 negotiations serve as a catalyst to unite our communities in order to demand that the necessary climate actions are taken. But even if the actions that are needed are not taken right now, each step that we take brings us closer to achieving the low-carbon future that we need. We can only hope that we don't set the appropriately ambitious goals once it has become too late.
Sending all of my positive energy and love for a strong agreement at COP21!
Minneapolis-based nonprofit, Climate Generation: A Will Steger Legacy, is leading a delegation of 10 Education Ambassadors to COP21 through their Window Into Paris program, December 5-11. These 10 teachers - representing diverse subject areas, grade levels, and school communities from Denver, Atlanta, upstate New York, western North Carolina and Minnesota - are connecting their students to climate policy in action, helping to build both climate literacy and the relevance of this issue in their students' lives.

What I am is a working mother of a 5-year-old boy.
Recently, there was a study that came out that suggested that parenting time doesn't matter in a child's ultimate success in life. It didn't seem to add up to me, and while it seemed like a bit of a relief that the hours I spend away from my child aren't affecting him, I knew there was probably something wrong. The word ""Duh!"" comes to mind...
Justin Wolfer, journalist for The New York Times dug deeper, and he found out what I had felt must be the case: The study is skewed, so you're not getting off the hook for spending time with your kid. (Nor do most parents want to, but we are tired, we are overworked, and we are burning it at both ends...)
It got me thinking about the choices we have to make as parents, and how difficult it can sometimes be. Is spending time with my kiddo important? Absolutely, and for a long time I thought work-life balance meant that I work, and I leave time for my kid. But I've been learning more recently that there's a third part, that I think, we as parents are inclined to neglect... for the best possible reasons too -- because we love our kids so damn much. That third part is our own happiness. Outside of work and outside of being a parent, finding joy in our life that is not tied directly to our children. 
The reason, I believe, parents wanted the skewed study to be true comes from fear, and ultimately, guilt. I'm no exception... I have guilt for the business trips, for working and missing the karate classes, for.... not always being there. And that's before I even factor in taking any time for myself.
So, I started thinking, what if we replace guilt with faith?  
Faith that we can exist in a world where we work hard, take care of our kids but also take care of ourselves and trust that they will be ok. I put this out to friends, co-workers, anyone who would answer. I was immediately struck by how it resonated with so many people -- single dads, single moms, divorced couples, happily married folks. All of them with one thing in common: they want their kids to thrive, but they would love to have a life in the process, and all pretty much agree that they would be better parents if they did. One person I spoke with summed it up simply and beautifully:
""The best gift i can give my child is showing him what a happy person looks like.""
I'm reminded of the expression ""do what I say not what I do."" I want my child to grow up with a healthy sense that he matters in this world, so what would I be showing him if I didn't find a way to take care of myself, and show him that I matter as well? This is hard because we want to protect them... But kids are insightful -- they know if we are phoning it in. They know if we are faking it. 
 (Creating moments with my son: The Annual Easter Egg Hunt)
So, how do we balance it all? Perhaps the question is better phrased like this:
How do we give our kids the best of ourselves during the times that we are there?  To me, it's a matter of quality. It's so easy to be there without actually being present. We live in a world of distractions, cell phones, computers, and good lord even now our watches are becoming devices connected to the digital world, so it can be very difficult to unplug enough to be there. I believe that one hour of true quality time is better than four hours of half-assed, cell-phone-attached-to-my-hand time, so I try everyday to be mindful of this.
It's about love.
As I typed this article on a train from Boston to NYC, I saw a mother sitting with her 16-year-old son. I decided to break the rules of train travel and talk to the person across from me, so put the question to her that I had already put out to so many people, just to see what a complete stranger would say to me. Once she realized I wasn't a lunatic but was actually making pleasant conversation on Amtrak, she thought about it, and her response was brilliant. I believe is a fitting conclusion to this article.
She said that while she was fortunate to have a job that kept her close to home for most of her kids lives, she believes that the most important thing a child can feel is loved, and the more of it the better. Parents are great, she said, but if you can ever get the whole ""it takes a village"" thing going for your kids, they will be surrounded by so much love that they will absolutely thrive. So maybe that's it. Maybe we need to, as a society pull together more, help each other, and in that, perhaps we can also thrive ourselves and give our kids the best gift we can give them: showing them what a happy person looks like.

97,PARENTING,Donna's Cancer Story: Chemo Starts,"Sheila Quirke, Contributor
Mary Tyler Mom",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donnas-cancer-story-chemo_us_5b9c37fce4b03a1dcc7d2ff2,"The first month was terrifying for us. We did what we needed to do and were grateful for the opportunity; grateful for the ability to inject poison into our girl's thin, tiny veins, if that is what it took to rid her of cancer.",2012-09-04,FAMILY,"This is the fourth of thirty-one installments of Donna's Cancer Story, which will appear daily in serial format through the month of September to recognize Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. Each post will cover one month of Donna's thirty-one months of cancer treatment.   It's hard to believe, but yesterday's entry only covered two weeks of the third month of Donna's treatment. There was simply too much happening to document it all, which is a bit like this month, too. Donna's cancer, to use an analogy, was very much like the stock market; the ups and downs are exhausting. The best strategy is simply to focus on what is happening right in the moment you are in and deal with the future as it comes. If it comes. 
Chemo was hard on Donna. I mean, she was a tiny girl, under 25 pounds. The regimen that was selected was known as ""ICE."" It required five inpatient hospital days to administer, including time for pre-hydration and post-hydration to help flush the toxins out of her system. An oncologist acquaintance referred to it as the ""sledgehammer"" of chemo cocktails. 
The first month was terrifying for us. We did what we needed to do and were grateful for the opportunity; grateful for the ability to inject poison into our girl's thin, tiny veins, if that is what it took to rid her of cancer. Triple sigh. When Donna was first discharged, we received a home health order, meaning a nurse would be coming and supplies would be sent so that we could manage Donna's IV and medicine needs in the comfort of our home. That adds stress to an already stressful situation, but you buck up and do what needs doing. That is the life of a Cancer Parent.
With the first round of chemo there was vomiting, loss of appetite, lethargy and the thinning of Donna's hair. Her beautiful curls were going away. It's such a vain thing, but ask any Cancer Mom and she will tell you -- this hurts like hell. Donna slogged through it, finding comfort in our arms and the distraction of TV and YouTube. Our parenting standards went away with Donna's hair. If potato chips, TV and staying up late brought her comfort, so be it, we would work through the consequences later.

We returned home, grappled with the King of Sucky Home Health Agencies and did the best we could to comfort Donna and tend to her needs. This was heartbreakingly difficult, as there was a battle going on within her body between chemo and her cells, both healthy and unhealthy, that brough almost constant discomfort. Nothing was good enough. Food, books, videos, TV shows; all were met with the plaintive wail of Donna yelling, ""SOMETHING ELSE!"" 
But we got through it. Amidst the discomfort, Donna developed neutropenia, the phase of treatment where your immune system collapses, making you vulnerable to opportunistic bugs. Infections can kill. We went back into the hospital after a long and tedious ER stay and were brought to our room in the oncology unit. I immediately walked to the nurse's desk and said, ""I think there's been a mistake. Donna is neutropenic and needs an isolation room."" God bless her, the nurse patiently explained that most of the kids on the floor were neutropenic. If she rolled her eyes, it was only after I walked away. The single room we enjoyed during the chemo infusion was simply good luck. 
Miraculously, Donna recovered after a couple of days and returned to good health. No infection developed, but she received days of IV antibiotics until our docs felt assured that there wouldn't be one. We went home to pack. That's right, pack. Thinking there was not enough going on in our lives, we had bought a new home. What the what? Yep, just days before Donna's diagnosis, we had put a bid on a new place not a mile from our old place. We were given the opportunity to back out when the developer learned of Donna's cancer, but we opted to move forward. It seemed a hopeful choice to us and one Donna fully endorsed. 
 I just shake my head when when I remember the insanity of this month. A few bags were packed and sent to a friend's home while they vacationed. A boatload of believers had a packing party for us and knocked it out over a day and a half. Movers came and when we returned to our home, it was a new home, just half a block away from Donna's favorite park. We had been unpacked by another crew of volunteers. Donna loved it, we all did. I would spend the next several months finding things others had unpacked for me, never forgetting how amazing human beings can be. Who hasn't fantasized about someone else packing, moving and unpacking you? That was one of the gifts that cancer brought us.
The plan for Donna was to have her rescanned a few weeks after the first chemo to determine if it was having the effect that was hoped for. Again, no roadmap, just hopes. The docs were pleased with her recovery -- this was hard to imagine, as we saw our girl shrinking and sad and thinning before our eyes. They saw a girl who had no infection and a quickly recovered immune system. Recovery is in the eyes of the beholder. Our oncologist suggested pushing up the scan dates to capitalize on Donna's health. Gulp. 
The MRI was performed at 6:30 a.m. on July 3. We got home about 11:30 that night, Donna wired and hungry from not eating since early that morning. The next day was quite possibly the longest day of my life. Donna played, Mary Tyler Dad kept her company and I nursed my anxieties with television, chocolate, soda and pajamas. Happy 4th of July, folks! On the 5th, unable to stand it a single second longer, I called our RN. The CT looked good, but the final read on her MRI was not complete. Given our history with hearing too-early interpretations of scan results, they were extra careful. A couple of hours later we got the call: Donna's lung lesions were significantly diminished. There was a clean spine and the residual brain tumor had remained stable. RELIEF. The chemo was working. Suddenly, we did have a roadmap. More of the same, possibly 4-6 more months. Bring it. We were on top of the world. Donna was strong and if she could handle it, so could we.
In the midst of this chaos, our friends had organized a benefit in our honor. They were worried about Donna's medical expenses and insurance and wanted to do what they could. This was so very humbling, to be on the receiving end of such generosity, and I fear to this day I will never be able to repay what people did for us in Donna's name. 
A few days after that, Donna turned 2. We celebrated with a platelet transfusion. Unexpected as it was -- we got the call at 2 p.m. -- the need was urgent and could not be postponed. Donna was okay with that. For her, it was a hospital day with two parents instead of one. And the docs and nurses gifted her beautifully wrapped presents and sang the happy birthday song. Our girl was 2!

98,PARENTING,Turning 21 in America,"Tim Elmore, Contributor
Founder and President of Growing Leaders, Best-Selling Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/turning-21_us_5b9d67b0e4b03a1dcc87a100,"In every culture there are rites of passage, markers that distinguish childhood from adulthood. But in America, our total focus at this stage and age is on rights. In fact, the first thing that pops into our minds when we think about turning ""21"" is drinking.",2013-08-05,FAMILY,"My son just turned 21. My wife, Pam, and some of his friends took him out for a nice dinner. We celebrated with him his cultural rite of passage. We joked about his legal right to drink... and about how most teens can hardly wait for that birthday.
His birthday, in fact, triggered a thought in me.
In every culture, the people who live there create rites of passage. They are markers that distinguish childhood from adulthood. In many cultures, there are ceremonies for young boys to learn how to be a man. For instance, in many African cultures, boys leave their mothers and go into the village for several days, learning to thatch a roof, hunt an animal, interact with men and use tools and weapons. Even today, the Hebrew culture celebrates the Bar Mitzvah and Bat Mitzvah for boys and girls who become teens. Regardless of how sacred the ceremony is, it is a rite of passage for those young people. It's about growing up.
But in America, our total focus at this stage and age is on rights. In fact, the first thing that pops into our minds when we think about turning ""21"" is drinking. It's the rite of passage. Manhood is about what you have the license to do. You can drink now. You can smoke. Sex is legal without talking to parents, or checking into a hotel or renting a car. All kinds of privileges become their possession. 
What's Missing?
When I paused to think about it, it dawned on me... there's nothing about personal responsibility, as in past cultures. It's about alcohol or sex, but never coupled with the counterpart of the responsibilities that arrive with our coming of age. While I believe alcohol and sex are to be enjoyed in the proper context, you rarely hear positive stories about young people -- who've just turned 21 -- that involve sex and alcohol. Why? Because rights without responsibility are rarely redemptive. In fact, much of the time, rights minus responsibilities simply create selfish brats. Privileges without price tags don't really help us grow up.
While I love the 21-year-olds I know... I dislike our emphasis on turning 21.
What If...
What if we pondered this issue, and came up with an incredible responsibility that became part of the 21st birthday in America? It would have to be a responsibility that challenged the guy or girl at the heart level; it must engage their passions. It must harness their creativity and gifts. It must be something they've wanted for a while, but only becomes theirs as they come of age. I know some parents who:
• Planned international trips for their kids when they turned a certain age. These were service trips, where they helped people in developing nations.
• Talked about projects in the community to help neighbors, but they reserved them for their kids to engage in when they came of age.
• Purchased power tools for their sons, but only allowed them to use them on a project they wanted to build when they came of age.
You'll have to figure out what works with your young people, but if we want our kids to become healthy adults -- responsibilities and rights must always go together.

99,PARENTING,What to REALLY Expect When You're Expecting,"Rachel Hollis, Contributor
TheChicSite.com, Author, Lifestyle Expert, Blogger, Public Spe...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/advice-for-new-moms_us_5b9cbfd9e4b03a1dcc81783c,"Motherhood is a beautiful, wonderful gift... except when it's not.",2013-02-09,FAMILY,"Let's go ahead and get the preliminaries out of the way.
I love my kids.
They are the greatest thing I've ever done with my life and they bring me joy every day.
Motherhood is a beautiful, wonderful gift ... except when it's not.
I know, some of you are gasping for breath. You can't believe I'd disparage being a mom or my kids, but you know what? I'm just keeping it real here and I bet those of you not Googling the number for CPS are nodding along while reading, or possibly throwing out a ""Giiiiiirrrrrl"" or a ""Preach it, sister!"" And so here it is, the truth... as a new mom, nine out of ten days in your life will be awesome. And one day (or at least the culmination of 12 really terrible hours) will be the WORST.
I chose the title for this post because all of the baby books you read and the shows you watch while pregnant tell you what to ""expect."" But using the word ""expect"" implies that you have any clue what you're getting yourself into. You don't.
Oh sure, on some level you know that you'll have tough days and sleepless nights, but no one ever sits you down and says, ""Look, this is a crapshoot at best, so gird your loins!"" At least not until today... I'm giving it to you here. The worst of what to expect when you have a baby.
You're going to look and smell like a homeless yoga instructor.  I say look, because you'll basically live in any kind of workout clothing you own. On some level, putting it on will make you feel like there's a chance you'll squeeze in a workout today. But in reality, it's really just that the pants are stretchy and can accommodate that weird belly flab that still won't go away three months later. I mention smell for several reasons. The first of which is that a shower has now become a rarified privilege. 
The second is that even if you DO shower, the baby WILL puke on you the second you put on clean clothes. At some point, you'll get tired of changing your clothes and will just spend the day smelling like sour milk.
You're going get to over your modesty real fast.  I used to be modest. I started to lose that characteristic the first time a labor and delivery nurse went to check my dilation and turned me into a hand puppet. The modesty got shot completely to hell two days later when the orderly in charge of the breakfast delivery walked in on me crying over a failed attempt to breastfeed with both of my ginormous, milk-engorged boobs on full display. I was so hungry I didn't even care -- I would have flashed him far more for that tray of lukewarm scrambled eggs. 
The truth is, though, your body is at the disposal of another human, one that doesn't really care that you're in the middle of Target. So whip it out lady, there's no room for prudes up in here!
You're going to be emotional.  Did I say emotional? I meant emotional wreck! I meant full-on Personalities of Sybil. Between barking at your partner and yelling at your other kids and the good ole totally-defeated-cry-your-eyes-out-because-you're-a-terrible-mother-who-can't-get-this-baby-to-sleep, you're definitely going to wonder if you've lost your mind. And here's the truth, Mama: You have!
You're going to dread the nighttime.  Around 6:45 p.m., you might start to feel like you're going to be OK. Perhaps your fellow parent is home from work, perhaps you finagled some kind of dinner, perhaps you even managed a load of laundry. But as the sun starts to set, the dread sets in; it's getting dark. All around you, people start to get ready for their evening... maybe they watch TV or read books, and maybe you do those things too. But you know that eventually, it'll be bedtime and you'll start the hell-on-earth that is waking up every two hours to feed. For some reason it's not as bad during the day, but when it's dark and you know that everyone else gets to sleep while you fight baby to take the binky FOR-THE-LOVE-OF-GOD it messes with your head and your sense of what's fair.
You're going to hate baby daddy.  Not all the time, obviously. But there will be moments -- oh, sister, will there be moments. Even the most helpful dads (and in my generous moments, I'm willing to admit that I'm married to one of those) will challenge your self-control. For a lot of reasons (lack of mammary glands being one of them), you get the lion's share of newborn rearing. And that can make you feel like life isn't fair. For instance, when he talks about how he's tired. Then he'll sheepishly look at you and say something like, ""Well, I mean, obviously not as tired as you are sweetie, but man, I just couldn't get into a deep sleep last night"" 
Oh really? YOU couldn't get a deep sleep?! What was it that kept you up? The ultra soft mattress or the extra fuzzy blankets? Perhaps it was the gentle whisper of the breeze outside the window of the GUEST ROOM??? I didn't hear the whispering breeze... nope, I was too busy listening to the dulcet tones of our screaming child to catch that one, but golly, I'm sorry you missed your REM cycle, maybe you should take a nap.
Your body is going to be destroyed.  Okay, I'll qualify this and say that it is totally possible to get your body back. I've done it twice already (and God willing, I will this time, too) but for a while at least, it's like Chernobyl. First of all, there's the weight gain. If you're like me, there's a lot of it and it's going to take a while to lose. Then once you lose it, for some reason your skin refuses to reunite with the body, as if it's mad at you and your decision to live off chicken strips for the last 9 months. It's loose and stretchy and it sways and slaps you when you try and get on the treadmill to run it off. Oh, and your boobs... Lord, what did your boobs ever do to deserve such ill-treatment?  You can't shut it off.  No, not the baby... though God, wouldn't it be amazing if they had on/off switches? What's that? You're looking for the the CPS number again? Back to my point. 
You can't shut being a MOM off. In the old days, you could be all, ""Man, I'm tired and it's Saturday, I think I'll sleep all day,"" or ""Man, I'm in the mood to dance, and it's Saturday, I think I'll drink too much and make bad decisions."" But now you're a mom. It doesn't matter if it's Saturday or Christmas or your sister's wedding, you've got to take care of baby first. I'll give you another example. Last week, I attended an event with my very own baby daddy. It was super fancy, black tie, cocktails... I was sitting at a table next to SJP and Kate Hudson! I had on my Spanx, my hair was blown out and I managed to make it the whole night without falling off my six-inch heels. I dare say, to the outside viewer, I was downright fabulous. And then I got home and I put on my milk-stained t-shirt and my sweatpants and I got up three times with the baby during the night to feed him. Fabulous or not, when I come home, as far as he's concerned, I'm just mommy.
So here it is, new mom, the honest truth. Some days this ""job"" of being a mom is going to suck. But clearly, no one would do it -- and I certainly wouldn't have done it three times -- if all the really crappy parts weren't outweighed by all the amazing stuff. Just prep yourself in advance so you know that when you have those really bad days, you're not alone. While you're crying with your new baby, I'm somewhere in California, covered in spit-up crying right along with you.

Seriously!  You have to jump through more hoops to adopt a dog than you do to have a baby.,2012-03-16,FAMILY,"Well, as long as parents like these exist, I don't need to worry about getting the World's Worst Parenting Award. WTF, people? Seriously? Two kids in one week left at Chuck E. Cheese?!
I can almost get how this could happen. Chuck E. Cheese is mind-numbing and being trapped there for several hours could have the same effect on you as waterboarding or other various forms of torture. You come out of your stupor and find yourself curled in the fetal position in a booth behind the Whack-a-Mole. You glance at your watch and realize the joint is closing in ten minutes and there's no way in hell you're going to spend the night. You grab your kid and stumble out. It isn't until hours later that your ears stop ringing and you gain some clarity and realize, Oh shit! I took two kids to Chuck E. Cheese's and only came home with one!
Only it didn't happen this way. Instead, one family took their 5-year-old to CEC to celebrate her birthday and forgot her. The family has ten kids and so the birthday girl wasn't missed until the next morning when it was time for school.
Where do I begin with this? It was her birthday and nobody missed her until the next day? Nobody thought, ""I want give Little Birthday Girl one more kiss and wish her one more Happy Birthday before I tuck her into bed""? I can't tell you how sad this makes me.
I am not the perfect mom by any stretch of the imagination, but if I'm home I tuck my kids into bed. If I'm at work when they go to bed, I kiss them after I get home and they're asleep. Does no one tuck Little Birthday Girl into bed? For some reason this upsets me more than the fact they left her behind. I can understand that in the hubbub of getting everyone out the door you think Auntie or Grandma has Little Birthday Girl in her car and you accidentally forget her. But you forget her until morning?? Poor Little Birthday Girl.
I get that they have a big family and it can be easy to lose someone, but don't big families use the buddy system or something? Don't big families learn from the Waltons to always do a roll call at the end of each night? Good night, Mary Ellen. Good night, Elizabeth. Good night, Jim Bob. Good night, John Boy. Good night, Little Birthday Girl. Little Birthday Girl? Has anyone seen Little Birthday Girl? OH MY GOD! We left her at Chuck E. Cheese!
The second family that left their child at Chuck E. Cheese this week didn't realize she was missing until they watched the nightly news and saw her face on television. This one amazes me more than the big family one. I imagine the big family parents are busy, busy, busy with all their kids and their night time routines and everyone looks the same and they're moving so fast no one can really get an accurate count of how many are there. I imagine it wasn't like that at the second girl's home. I imagine this girl's family sitting on the couch, relaxing with a cold drink and seeing her picture on the news. I imagine her mother spitting her cold drink all over the TV when her daughter's picture comes up.
The parents of this little girl share custody of her and they were both at the party, but they assumed she went home with a relative. Ummm....wouldn't you double check that? (I'm guessing they will next time.)
This just goes to show it might not be a bad idea to give a standardized test to all new parents before they leave the hospital with their new babies. Seriously! You have to jump through more hoops to adopt a dog than you do to have a baby and I'm guessing these parents shouldn't even have a dog, let alone a kid.
I have a large extended family and my kids love to ride in grandma's car or their aunt's car. The difference is, my family comes to me and says, ""Gomer wants to go with me. You OK with that?"" They would never just take my kids without telling me and I would never assume they had my kids when I got home and I didn't.
It's ironic, because I hate to go to CEC and one of the reasons (besides the obvious exposure to Black Plague) is that I'm always worried my kids will get snatched by some creepy pedophile. I worry, because it's literally impossible to keep my eye on both of my kids in that place since they run off in different directions. I worry that they'll think I've left them there and so they'll leave the building to see if my car is still in the parking lot and they get run over. (Yes, it's difficult for me to sleep at night with all this insane worrying. These are just my CEC worries -- now you see why I'm not crazy about the beach!) However, these two stories showed me that CEC might be one of the safest places for my kids. These little girls were left on their own and no one barely noticed them, let alone tried to snatch them. Maybe I've been too hard on CEC. Maybe I could use CEC like a cheap drop in babysitting place. I could give my kids a roll of tokens and tell them I'll see them in three hours?

As I was waiting to enter this ""sale of sales,"" I found myself becoming entrenched in a conversation that a group of women were having. That's a gentle way of saying I was eavesdropping.
The women ranged in age from their late twenties through 45ish. They were discussing their relationships and the ups and downs that inevitably go with them. One woman was certain her husband was surprising her with a summer cruise while another was ready to move out and leave the kids with ""him."" And then, the 45-ish woman began to speak of her.... (drumroll) lover.
I choked on my hot dog at the sound of that word. A lover? The woman had a lover? Maybe it's me, but that's a term I've only heard in songs from Air Supply circa 1984.
I was in full Yenta mode. She was my age (truth be told, I am not 25) and she had a lover. Wow. I began repeating that word in my head between hot dog bites.
My lover. Hmmm. Where do you find these ""lovers""? Do you rent them? Buy them? Do they come in different sizes and require batteries?
I have never used the term before. I have said ""I love you,"" to my parents, kids, husband and pets, but never used ""lover"" to describe a person's relationship with me. Is a boyfriend a lover? How about a bed buddy? Does that count? Is your husband your lover?
I thought about this for a moment and before I knew it, I was starring in my own James Bond flick.
I pretended my ""lover"" was sending me text messages as I looked at my phone and giggled. The women glanced my way as I smiled at the pretend sweet nothings my ""lover"" was texting to my Goofy-covered iPhone. I seductively reapplied my cherry-flavored chapstick. (After picking a piece of potato chip off -- daughter must've used it). I let out a raucous laugh as my lovers texts became suggestive and R-rated.
I wondered what my lover's name should be; something exotic like Vincenzo or Jacques. Maybe I had many lovers; one per country or time zone depending on my mood. Jon Paul would whisk me off to Paris for the weekend where we would frolic in the countryside amongst the daffodils and enjoy a picnic of pink champagne and escargot. 
A week later, Antonio would have his driver fetch me for a quick getaway to Rome, where we would dine along the Venice canals sipping sweet sangria and feeding each other tiny bites of pistachio gelato topped off with an evening of unbridled passion.
I guess if I were in a country-western mood, my Levi-wearing, flannel shirt lover would take me to his dude ranch for a weekend of horseback riding (be creative) and ribs. This led me to wonder if all lovers were wealthy and lived in fancy estates adorned with imported marble and butlers. Maybe they were struggling musicians with tattooed arms and piercings. Perhaps my struggling, misunderstood musician declared his love for me in a song or by getting his nipple pierced. The possibilities were endless, as was the vibrating I kept feeling in hand. (It was the phone -- keep it G-rated, please). I was soon transported from a steamy hotel room with Roger Moore to singing snowmen who wanted to live in the springtime.
When I stopped my reverie to actually answer the phone, it was my 6-year old daughter wondering why it was taking me so long to come home. I heard my husband and the other kids in the background all waiting for mom to get home so they could eat dinner. (Why is that always the case? I have an endless supply of Vanilla Chex).
And that's when I realized: I do have lovers, many of them. They have different names, styles, likes and dislikes. They come in different shapes, sizes and enjoy a variety of hobbies. One of them even gets to take me out on special dates which (if he's lucky) leads to an even more special night. Right at that moment, I got that mushy feeling us moms get when we imagine our home life peaceful and serene like a Norman Rockwell painting.
As my group was about to enter the sale of sales, I quickly did an about-face. One of the women asked where I was going, ""This is a once in a lifetime sale!"" 
I casually replied, "" I have to go, my lovers need me.""

In January, Childhood Cancer International (CCI) launched Child4Child, a campaign that invites kids and teens to record themselves singing a song by Frozen score composer Christophe Beck called ""We Are One.""
The empowering song features messages about strength and bravery in the face of difficult battles like cancer. As the press release for the campaign notes, ""More than 900,000 children and teens have not only recorded themselves singing the chorus; they have created dances, lip-syncing videos, and even covers!""
 In honor of International Childhood Cancer Awareness Day, CCI officially released the song on iTunes on Monday, along with a video showing some of the many kids who participated in the initiative in the U.S. and beyond.
It's a beautiful display of the power of solidarity, especially when kids get involved.

I have a perfect husband who is likewise, a perfect father. We have a perfect marriage. So naturally, we have perfect children and a perfect family. Before you pass a quick judgement on me, let me explain further.",2014-11-19,FAMILY,"So many of us strive for perfection. I believe for many of us, it's an innate desire within us, whether we'd like to admit to it or not. After all, we are made in His image. As contradictory as it may sound, God's power is certainly made perfect within our weaknesses. 
I am proud to say that I am the perfect mother. I have a perfect husband who is likewise, a perfect father. We have a perfect marriage. So naturally, we have perfect children and a perfect family. 
Before you pass a quick judgement on me, let me explain further. 
Perfect can be defined as having all the required or desirable elements, qualities or characteristics; as good as it is possible to be. Absolute; complete.
Why am I a perfect mother? I'm perfect because in the six years that I have been blessed to hold this title, I have failed again, and again, and again. I have made more mistakes that I can possibly total to this day. I have been irritable and impatient due to exhaustion and weariness. I have seen sides of myself that need so much correction, that leave me feeling humbled at the numerous situations I have found myself in. 
But with that said, as many times as I have failed, I have gotten right back up. I have dusted myself off, looked myself in the mirror and prayed to God that each of those falls made me a better mother. I have turned my life, my heart, my complete existence over to the constant thought of each and every decision I make and its effect on my children, our family. I never knew I was capable of the immense love I could hold until the day they placed my daughter on my chest. It was possibly the most overwhelming moment of my lifetime. Right then and there, I was forever changed. 
I know that despite the number of mistakes I've made and the mistakes I'm bound to make in the future, my love as a mother is perfect. My love for my children isn't capable of ever faltering or, for that matter, ever diminishing. My love for my children is never-ending and has no flaws to be found within it. A mother's love for her children, without argument, is perfect. 

Why is my husband a perfect father? He changes diapers. He does the dishes. He gives the babies their baths. He brushes teeth and combs hair. He dresses kids in the morning and gets their jammies on them in the evening. He ties and reties shoelaces. He cooks meals. He rubs heads to sleep. He sleeps on hardwood floors beside toddler beds just in case the scary monster comes back. He watches Dora, The Bubble Guppies and Team Umizoomi more times than any adult should. Basically, when he is not at work, he is in Daddy mode. 24 hours a day, 365 days a year (ok, maybe for the exception of NFL Draft Day and Sundays during football season).
Should he do a lot of those things? Sure. Does he want to do a lot of those things, day in and day out, even when he's sick or sleep deprived? No. But... he does them anyway. And the majority of the time, he does them without complaint. He gives his family everything he can, but mainly he gives us himself. 
My husband would walk across fire to the ends of the earth for our children, without hesitation. Yes, he is the perfect father. 
Why is my marriage perfect? Our marriage has been put to the test more times than I can say I would have liked. And I am no fool to believe that it's not done being tested. Throughout these tests, there have been numerous times it would have been easier to give up, to give in and well, call it a day. There has been hundreds of times in the past decade that my husband and I have pulled ourselves out of ruts so deep, it was hard to even imagine a light at the end of the tunnel. We've fought hard but thankfully, we've loved even harder. Most days I drive him absolutely nuts and he can agitate me like no other, but I can't picture a day without him beginning it or a night without him ending it. 
It may possibly be one of the most comforting feelings in this world to know he loves me completely, flaws and all. He loves me as much as he knows how to love. And for that, I very well may be one of the luckiest women on this planet. 

Yes, our marriage is perfect because our love has outlasted and overcome what the world says it shouldn't and very well couldn't. Our love for one another is indeed perfect. 
Why are our children perfect? My children fight (OK, they battle one another), they throw temper-tantrums, they complain about some things that they shouldn't and every day they need more than one (or two) gentle reminders on things they should have handled correctly the first time. However, their resiliency and innocent love is captivating. Their sincere empathy, in my opinion, is why this world is still here, still continuing on. I'm not sure at what point in our childhood, teens or adulthood that we lose that kind of love, forgiveness, endurance and ultimately, childlike faith. 
My children... they're human. They make mistakes. But... yes, they are their own perfection. When I look into each of their eyes, I could get lost in their ultimate love and endless wonder that I pray to God every day they never lose. I encourage my son and daughters to be big dreamers. To think the impossible. To go after the impossible. I know that if I teach them to believe enough in themselves and never lose that, they will be able to accomplish anything in this world. 

And lastly, why is our family perfect? I have thanked and praised God everyday that He had our plan, our perfect plan, laid out so carefully, so divinely, that no matter what this world has thrown at us or will continue to battle our family with, we will stand strong. We will stand together, and not if, but when we are brought to our knees again, we will turn and wait patiently for once again, the One who has turned each and every hardship and battle into a magnificent blessing.
So, as you can see, your definition of perfect and my definition of perfect may slightly differ. I have such a gratified feeling that I have found my perfection that I have prayed for since I was a little girl. I'm grateful that each day as I slip and make my mistakes, I'm reminded in some fashion of who I want to be, what I want to create and what my purpose is while on this earth. 
Find your perfect. Strive for your perfection. Will I ever reach the world's standards of perfection as a mother and wife? No. Will my husband ever reach the world's standards for perfection as a father or husband? Nope. Will our marriage and family and children meet those worldly standards for perfection? It's safe to say ""no.""
But I can say one thing: I wouldn't trade our perfect for any other perfect in this life.

108,PARENTS,The Parenting Resolution I Make Every Year,"Sarah Stewart Holland, ContributorBlogger, bluegrassredhead.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-parenting-resolution-i-make-every-year_b_6413980.html,The bubbles were forgotten. An entire year's worth of small moments missed because I kept putting them off for another day.,2015-01-05,FAMILY,"I was cleaning out my junk drawer, a thankless task that always reveals the less flattering aspects of my life I'd rather keep hidden. Projects neglected. Maintenance forgotten. Guilty pleasures stashed away. 
This time was no different. The first one I pulled out I didn't think too much about. Then there was another. And another. And another. AND another.
Five little bubble containers. There were five of the little bottles given out at birthday parties and stashed in holiday gift bags. There was a little red one topped with a snowman. There was a little yellow one with an Easter egg stamped in to the plastic. A turquoise one. A blue one. A green one. 
Every one of them was taken from pleading little hands and stashed away. ""It will make too big of a mess,"" I'd say as Griffin begged to be allowed to blow bubbles. ""You'll just spill it everywhere,"" my frowning reply. How many times had I stopped him as he tried to open the container? How many times had I talked him out of one of the easiest and purest of childhood joys?
I'd put them in the junk drawer with the intention of pulling them all out when it was time to blow bubbles. But when is it really time to blow bubbles? Never in my life have I penciled in ""blow bubbles"" on to my weekly schedule. ""Blow bubbles"" never makes a to-do list or an activities calendar -- at least not mine. Even when I create time in our schedule for ""play,"" it's the flashy activities of the season that get all the attention. We build a snowman. We run in the sprinklers. We fly a kite. 
Meanwhile, the bubbles were forgotten. An entire year's worth of small moments missed because I kept putting them off for another day. 
Well, not this year. 
This year, I resolve to blow more bubbles. 
These amazing little creatures that inhabit my life are so like bubbles themselves. Beautiful and slightly magical. A little messy. And oh-so-very temporary. Already I can feel them leaving me. Griffin will be in five-day-a-week preschool next year and then it's just a hop, skip, and a jump to kindergarten. Pop! Amos leaves behind another symbol of babyhood every day. Pop! Pop! Pop!
So, while they are still here, while they are still little, I'm going to soak it all up. It is so easy to get busy and forget that my children aren't just passengers as I run errands and complete projects. Often, I tell myself they are the reason I try so hard. I want to make money to buy them the things they need. I want to create a house they love being in. I want to be a person they can admire. And as important as all that is, they are not only a source of must-do's in my life. They are also the source of joy. But joy doesn't just come from scheduled activities. In my experience, I feel it most profoundly when I stop to enjoy those everyday moments that come and go so quickly. 
Like blowing bubbles in the middle of breakfast or on the way to the mailbox or while we're waiting for Daddy to get home.
Plus, bubbles make those moments so very easy. I don't know why, for so long, I saw blowing bubbles as a messy chore. There is no prep. There are no special outfits. The thin film of soap left behind just makes my next cleanup that much easier. I only have to pull out one of these tiny little containers and watch Amos's eyes fill with glee as Griffin giggles and smiles. 
And I try to soak it all up before these moments are gone.
Pop!

109,DIVORCE,6 Ways To Beat Stress In A Blended Family,Brittany Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/6-ways-to-handle-stress_us_5b9df087e4b03a1dcc8f2203,"2. When you start to feel overwhelmed, take it one hurdle at a time. Husband and wife team Jennifer and Jason said they handle",2014-03-21,FAMILY,"As part of our Blended Family Friday series, each week we're spotlighting a different stepfamily to learn how they successfully blended their two families. Our hope is that by telling their stories, we'll bring you closer to blended family bliss in your own life!
Want to know real stress? Get married, have kids, then get divorced and settle down with someone with kids of their own. From conflicts in custody agreements to vindictive former spouses edging their way into household drama, there's no shortage of stress in the lives of blended family parents. 
So what can stepparents do to reduce some of the tension in their lives? Below, we look back at some of the best advice the parents in our Blended Family Friday series have shared with us in the past. See what they had to say, then head to the comments and add your best advice on beating stress in a blended family. 
1. Figure out a co-parenting plan with your spouse early on. Parenting someone else's kids is not easy -- and those first few years are usually the toughest. That said, the road to peaceful relations with your new stepkid will be a lot less rocky if you and your spouse are able to come to an agreement on how you'll parent, including who will be in charge of discipling. 
Stepmom Janice Bissell figured this out with her husband early on in their marriage.""[My husband] gave me fairly free reign on structure and discipline for his youngest, CJ, and he always backed me up."" 
On bigger issues with her stepkids, though, Bissell said her husband is the decider -- and she's fine with that. ""I've also learned to give up control, which has been so hard, but ultimately a very good and necessary thing for our family,"" she said.
2. When you start to feel overwhelmed, take it one hurdle at a time.   Husband and wife team Jennifer and Jason said they handle stress the same way any non-blended family would. The only difference? The stress that comes their way includes ""slow family courts, pricey parenting coordinators and difficult exes."" 
So how do they deal? ""Stress is stress. We eat the elephant one bite at a time like everybody else,"" Jennifer said. ""We keep an open forum for communication across the board and spend a great deal of time being together so our bond is strong and valuable. No matter how stressful any of our situations become, we never lose sight of our main goal, which is to experience joy."" 
3. See your family -- including the exes -- as a team. Having an ""us against them"" mentality is the best way to sabotage your attempts to blend your family or get along with your ex, said Prentiss Earl, a father of two who's still close with his ex-wife and her new family. 
""I'd argue that our situation was more stressful when we maintained a separatist attitude with our individual households,"" he told us. ""I don't feel family-related stress as much as I used to because of the way we've come together as a team.""
4. Invest in a chore chart.  If you want to see chores actually get done in your home, it's time to buy a big white chore board, said stepmom Raiye Rosado. ""Use a chore chart, for the love of all that's good in the world. Seriously, it changed everything.""

5. Remind yourself to celebrate even the smallest of victories.  Your oldest and youngest bond while building a pillow fort. You and your wife managed to coordinate your custody agreements so you could plan a mini vacation in the fall. Small wins like this are worth celebrating, said blended family mom Andi Parker-Kimbrough. ""Live one day at a time (or one moment if you have to),"" she said. ""Blend little by little and celebrate even the smallest breakthrough."" 
6. Whatever you do, don't aim for perfection.  No nuclear family is perfect, so why should any blended family strive to be? Our reader Kellee Mulkerin-Ford told us that the first step in making progress as a blended family is to lower your expectations a bit. ""Stop thinking that things are going to be perfect. It's not going to happen,"" she said. ""The kids will not get along all the time, the house will be not always be quiet, you will not always hear 'please' and 'thank you.'"" 
Instead, she recommended that parents take a more sensible approach to blending. ""What is realistic is taking stock of how incredibly lucky you are to have more children to love and to guide.""

The Blind Side/Something Kind of Too Dramatic for What You're in the Mood For
One of the most under-appreciated extras of getting to steal away for a manicure is straining your neck to read the subtitles on the muted romantic comedies screened at the nail salon. 
This was the only way you were able to watch 17 minutes of Dallas Buyers Club (and therefore be able to speak confidently about Matthew McConaughey's Oscar chances) and 42 minutes of the Sandra Bullock/Melissa McCarthy fun fest, The Heat (and never tell anyone you stayed in the drier an extra half hour because you were shamefully amused).
Before you hustle off for your next You Don't Know Jacques! session, be warned: This is a tale of two Sandra Bullocks. 
They'll be playing The Blind Side. Again. Just like they've been doing since it came out. And when it ends, front desk person will start up something that is 100 percent not the light, female buddy cop flick you wanted. Instead, it's something with a guy who's probably British (you'll never know; the sound is off) and probably with Naomi Watts with unkempt hair, because all single hardworking mothers in movies have unkempt hair.

You don't say a WORD when he retires to the basement EVERY SINGLE Saturday to watch college football, and you've had this ONE NIGHT on the calendar with your book club/Bunco friends (same friends) for FOUR MONTHS.

111,DIVORCE,Lawyers Fail to Give Clients All Options Available for Resolving Conflict,"Mark Baer, Contributor
Mediator, Family Law Attorney, Collaborative Law Practitioner,...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawyers-fail-to-give-clie_us_5b9d762fe4b03a1dcc884a10,"As I like to remind people, you can only give what you have and teach what you know. If the legal community won't embrace ADR, maybe an educated public can force the issue.",2013-08-26,FAMILY,"The obligation of lawyers to advise clients about litigation alternatives to dispute resolution has been the subject of debate for well over a decade. In fact, in 2005, Gerald F. Phillips, Esq. wrote and article titled, ""The Obligation of Attorneys to Inform Clients about ADR."" In that article, he stated, ""There appears to be a growing view that lawyers should discuss ADR with clients."" At the time he wrote that article the American Bar Association's Model Rule on the subject was Rule 2.1, which provided as follows: ""In representing a client, a lawyer shall exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice. In rendering advice, a lawyer may refer not only to law but to other considerations such as moral, economic, social and political factors, that may be relevant to the client's situation."" At that time, the Rule was considered somewhat of a joke because by using the word ""may,"" it failed to mandate anything. Nevertheless, Virginia imposed a mandatory obligation on attorneys to advise clients of the ""advantages, disadvantages, and availability of dispute resolution processes."" Unfortunately, other states enacted Rules which were as weak as the American Bar Association's Model Rule. Sadly, little has changed since that time and the American Bar Association's Model Rule is still exactly the same. 
In 2005, Gerald F. Phillips wrote the following: ""The client faces the greatest consequences of any decision regarding the means of resolving a legal dispute. Yet typically the client is not informed of alternatives to litigation unless the matter is court ordered, requested by an opposing disputant or required by a contractual provision.... Clients are most often in the best position to determine what is in their best interests. Clients know how important it may be to preserve the relationship with the other party. A court decision may destroy a relationship that may be very important to the client. The client, not the attorney should decide whether to use mediation. The attorney may, for legal, strategic or other reasons, want the matter to go to court while the client may desire that an effort be made to settle the controversy though mediation. The client is often unable to make such a decision without the attorney explaining the processes. Some clients do not even know that mediation and arbitration are available. For the decision to be meaningful the client must have a full understanding of the various ADR options.... Many trial lawyers have come to consider themselves as 'resolvers of disputes,' not merely gladiators to do combat in the courts. And though ADR is now central to the practice of law, there will not be complete acceptance of ADR until clients, the public and all members of the professional fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of the various forms of ADR.""
On December 14, 2009, John M. Delehanty, Esq. published an article titled ""Do Attorneys Have An Ethical Obligation To Discuss ADR With Their Clients Under the Professional Conduct Rules & When Do They Have To Do It?"" In that article, he stated, ""There is no consensus about whether lawyers have an ethical obligation to discuss ADR with their clients.... The majority of state ethics codes suggest, but to do not require, that lawyers discuss ADR with clients.... Many states' ethics rules relating to legal fees and the client's right to control litigation decisions suggest that lawyers have an implicit ethical obligation to discuss ADR with their clients.... While state ethics rules do not explicitly requires lawyers to discuss ADR with their clients, many courts require parties and their counsel to confer, or at least to sign certifications affirming that they have conferred, about resolving litigation through ADR. Implicit obligations alone do not provide sufficient incentives for lawyers to include ADR in the range of options which they present to their clients. To make sure that lawyers do in fact inform their clients of the availability of ADR, the states should require lawyers to consult with their clients about ADR and obtain informed consent from the clients concerning the dispute resolution method they wish to pursue.""
In 2011, I had the pleasure of hearing Tobias Desjardins, the Director & Founder of the International Center for Peaceful Shared Custody, speak. During his talk, he mentioned that families are frequently referred to him by judicial officers when a child becomes suicidal as a result of their parents protracted custody battle. He told us that by the time he sees these families, both parents have worked with several different attorneys and that they have consistently told him that the first time they learned about mediation or collaborative divorce was through him. This reality is not only indicative of unethical conduct by family law attorneys, but it is just plain tragic.
In 2012, I took part in a discussion of family law on the Los Angeles County Bar Association's Family Law Section Listserv. After one lawyer pointed out that ""the code of ethics requires attorneys to advise their clients about mediation possibilities,"" a number of others chimed in with reason after reason for opposing the use of mediation in family law cases. Eventually I spoke up. ""Why is it that mediation and collaborative divorce is very successful in other countries (such as the U.K.), and in some states in the U.S., but the family law litigation community here seems to have a completely different impression? Is it that people in Los Angeles somehow differ from people everywhere else?"" Disappointingly-but not surprisingly-no one even acknowledged my question.
However, even if lawyers were required to discuss the various ADR options with their clients, how would they effectively do so if they don't fully understand those processes? For example, the Mediation Descriptions by the Maryland Program for Mediator Excellence specifically provides as follows: ""'Evaluative Mediation' is not defined here because we believe it is a misnomer. Evaluation is a technique, not a mediation framework. If a process consists solely of an evaluation and attempts to get participants in line with the evaluation, then that process is not mediation, it is more likely a settlement conference."" I have referred to ""evaluative mediation"" as an alternative form of litigation and others refer to it as ""soft arbitration."" Regardless of how it is described, it is not mediation. Unfortunately, however, the legal community in many states including California, emphasize the use of ""evaluative mediation"" and it is the preferred method of mediation. In fact, they don't even need to distinguish it because that is basically the only form of ""mediation"" used by the vast majority of the legal community. In fact, as recently as August 18, 2013, many in the mediation community were discussing just this issue. They were expressing frustration over the fact that little has changed over the past several decades. The consensus was that public education was the answer. As I like to remind people, you can only give what you have and teach what you know. If the legal community won't embrace ADR, maybe an educated public can force the issue.

It is much easier to turn the TV on, check out and give into your symptoms. However, with chronic illness, this isn't always the best thing to do.
Staying active, even in a limited capacity, can speed recovery, keep your mind sharp, help retain mobility and possibly ease symptoms -- the same symptoms that would prevent being active in the first place. 
It is important to find balance between exertion that helps and exertion that wipes you out. Work with your health care team and use trial and error to find the level of activity that is right for you and your diagnosis. 
Being active doesn't always have to look like heavy physical exercise. There are even things you can do even from bed on days when symptoms prevent mobility. Give yourself a nudge and experiment with these 10 ways to stay active:
Walk: Maybe marathons are out, but walking has a myriad of benefits. Start with short 15-minute strolls around your neighborhood or a local park.
Yoga: You can get gentle yoga DVDs to start a practice right in your living room or join a local class. Many yoga studios offer gentle yoga or yoga for people coping with health issues. The meditative aspect of yoga will also reduce stress.
Water Aerobics: The decrease in gravity is easier on sore muscles and joints while still improving flexibility and cardiovascular strength. You do not need to be a strong swimmer, or hold your breath to participate. 
Work With a Trainer: A trainer who specializes in chronic illness will be able to offer a workout routine that is tailor made to your abilities. A good trainer will keep you motivated and accountable, even when your health wants to let you slide. 
Go to Physical Therapy: If your diagnosis involves a loss of mobility, talk with your primary care physician about seeing a physical therapist. They can help you retain the mobility you have and regain flexibility and strength. They will also teach you simple exercises you can do at home to stay active.
Get Outside: Just 15 minutes in the sun enjoying the breeze and view will deliver essential vitamin D and boost your mood. If you're feeling adventurous go for a drive in the country or a relaxing boat tour of your local harbor.
Refresh: Even if you are planning to stay in bed for the day, take a shower and change into new clothing. Before you climb back into bed, sit in a chair or on the couch in a different area of the house. This can be especially important to ease back into movement after surgery. 
Make Dates: Schedule time to meet up with a friend for coffee or to have a visitor to your home. Having something on the calendar provides a bright moment to look forward to. 
Join a Book Club: You can find a variety of book clubs for all genres. Having others read along with you is a good way to stay socially active and to have a completion deadline. If you can't get out of the house, there are virtual book clubs meeting all over the internet.
Care for a Pet: Visit your local shelter to see if there is a furry friend suited to your abilities who needs a home. There is no better motivation than the unconditional love of a pet to get you walking, playing and cuddling.
Illness is a challenge, but one you are capable of meeting. You can do more than you think that you can. Work with your doctors to stay active and engaged which can help you not only cope but thrive.

113,HEALTHY LIVING,Want to Harm Your Relationship? Here Are 2 Easy Ways!,"Douglas LaBier, ContributorBusiness psychologist, psychotherapist & writer; director, Cen...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/want-to-harm-your-relatio_b_6670390.html,"Relationships suffer from any kind of hidden communications. Countless couples become entrenched in patterns that steadily erode and undermine their mutual understanding, respect and prospects for sustaining intimacy. This research adds credence to the damage and suffering that results.",2015-02-13,HEALTH & WELLNESS," Throughout the years I've worked a great deal with individuals and couples in psychotherapy who've become masters at damaging their relationships. They do so in a number of ways, but two, in particular, are most effective. They engage in a kind of dance: 
One partner withdraws, emotionally, when confronting differences or conflicts, and then hunkers down, waiting -- or hoping -- for the conflict to go away, somehow. The other partner conveys his or her desires or feelings by, well... saying nothing. The magical thinking, here, is that the partner will, of course, know how to mind-read, and then respond accordingly, as one hopes and expects.
It's classic -- and you can almost hear a Strauss waltz playing as the couple does this little dance together. It's very familiar in psychotherapy, and now some empirical research has honed in on this pattern. It shows the different ways in which both withdrawal and mind-reading harm relationships; with different degrees of harmful consequences. The findings highlight, in my view, the importance of practicing greater transparency throughout one's relationship - ""radical transparency,"" as I've called it in this previous post -- as scary as that can feel at the outset.
The research, conducted at Baylor University, examined these two patterns and demonstrated how they are harmful in different ways, and for different reasons. ""Withdrawal is the most problematic for relationships,"" said researcher Keith Sanford. ""It's a defensive tactic that people use when they feel they are being attacked, and there's a direct association between withdrawal and lower satisfaction overall with the relationship."" And, ""Expecting your partner to be a mind-reader"" -- which often reflects feeling anxious in the relationship -- ""...makes it especially difficult for couples to make progress toward resolving conflicts.""
The study was published in Psychological Assessment, and is described in detail in this report from Baylor. It concluded that that withdrawal doesn't necessarily influence whether a couple can resolve their conflict, but expecting or hoping the other person will be a mind reader ""has a direct influence on the couple's ability to settle the issue.""
The researchers found that withdrawing from a partner's criticism or complaint can reflect feeling threatened, and is ""more characteristic of unhappiness...you see more of that in distressed relationships."" Those who expect a partner to know what's wrong without being told tend to feel anxious and neglected; vulnerable, rather than threatened. Conflicts in which one partner expects the other to mind-read were more likely to lead to negative communication and anger.
Either way, relationships suffer from any kind of hidden communications. Countless couples become entrenched in patterns that steadily erode and undermine their mutual understanding, respect and prospects for sustaining intimacy. This research adds credence to the damage and suffering that results.

115,HEALTHY LIVING,6 Ways To Get More Love In Your Life,"Karen M. Wyatt, M.D., ContributorAuthor, 'What Really Matters: 7 Lessons for Living from the St...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/more-love-in-your-life_b_7596702.html,"While many of us are searching for romantic love, remember that true love comes in many different forms and circumstances. Getting more love in your life requires more than dating tips; you'll have to work at it and make some inner changes to find love that has deeper meaning.",2015-06-27,HEALTH & WELLNESS,"The Beatles said it best: ""Love is all you need."" But do you feel you have enough love in your personal life? According to a 2010 survey by the Fetzer Institute, 68 percent of Americans say they need more meaningful love in their lives and 95 percent believe that we need more love in the world.
Since love is one of the most basic human emotions, how can it be that so many of us find it lacking in our lives? We see the word ""love"" used everywhere these days in advertising for material goods like hamburgers, cars, shoes, eyeglasses and cosmetics. But the genuine love that so many of us long for in our lives involves so much more than the excitement we feel over our favorite footwear.
True love is a powerful, creative force that can inspire humans to write symphonies, trek for months on foot, build a massive mausoleum, and make superhuman sacrifices. But love also leaves us feeling vulnerable and opens us up to possible rejection. Love requires courage, patience and effort, which are difficult to maintain in our fast-paced, superficial society.
While many of us are searching for romantic love, remember that true love comes in many different forms and circumstances. Getting more love in your life requires more than dating tips; you'll have to work at it and make some inner changes to find love that has deeper meaning. Here are some steps you can take to help you cultivate true love:
# 1. Love Yourself First
Before you can share love with others you have to feel it within yourself. That means you need to find practices and routines that help you genuinely love who you are, just as you are right now. 
Try taking yourself on a ""date"" once a week and spend time alone, doing something you thoroughly enjoy. For example: 
Linger with a latte and a good book at your favorite coffee shop
Take a walk in nature
Visit an art gallery or museum that inspires you
Attend a concert
Watch a video about love
As you spend this time with yourself, focus your intention on truly loving YOU and filling yourself up with positive feelings and energy. The more you concentrate on loving yourself the more you will radiate positive feelings of love toward others and attract their love in return.
#2. Recognize Your Barriers to Love
The Sufi poet and philosopher Rumi wrote: ""Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.""
Whether you realize it or not, you may have barriers hidden within you that prevent you from giving and receiving love. Perhaps you have been hurt or betrayed by a past relationship or you fear being vulnerable to other people.
Spend some time in contemplation and write in your journal about your past experiences with love and how you feel about giving yourself over to love. Once you identify your own internal barriers to love you will be able to heal your wounds from the past and rise above them. This is an important step if you want to deepen your ability to genuinely love others. 
#3 Practice the Lovingkindness Blessing 
This Buddhist blessing (also called ""Metta"") can be a powerful reminder to love yourself and others if you use it as a daily practice. Here are the five phrases of the blessing:
May I be at peace.
May my heart remain open.
May I realize the beauty of my own true nature.
May I be healed.
May I be a source of healing for this world.
Repeat this blessing every day as part of your daily practice and you will begin to feel your heart expanding with compassion for yourself and others. Next change the ""I"" in each phrase to ""you"" and use the blessing to send love to someone else.
#4. Give For the Sake of Giving
One of the best ways to bring more love into your life is to give your time and energy to others who need your help. Volunteer at an animal shelter, Head Start program, homeless shelter, or nursing home and you will find ample opportunities to share your love with others who need to be loved. 
When you give of yourself with no expectation of return, you will find that you are blessed in many ways and love will begin flowing through you freely. You will begin to attract others into your life who can appreciate your loving and generous behavior.
#5. Open Your Heart
The HeartMath Institute teaches a simple method for opening your heart to love called the Inner Ease Technique. Use this practice as part of your daily routine (along with the Lovingkindness Blessing) and you will soon be able to overcome the barriers to love you have identified. Here are the steps:
Place your hand on your heart area and imagine you are breathing in and out through your heart.
Breathe slowly and gently until your breathing feels smooth and balanced, not forced.
With each breath draw in a feeling of inner-ease, balance and self-love into your heart. 
You can do this practice in any place at any time to reduce anxiety and open yourself up to others.
#6. Find Love In Every Situation
As you open your heart to love and expand your capacity to express love for yourself and others, you will begin to see love everywhere you go. Then love can become your ""default mechanism"" so that you will choose love whenever you are in a situation of doubt or uncertainty.
For example, if a conflict arises with coworkers or a friend, choose the solution that contains the most love. If you face a crisis and must decide on your next steps, let love be your guide. When you need to give feedback to another person, be motivated by love rather than anger.
As you practice embodying love in your life in various ways, you will discover that you have always had all the love you need -- you just couldn't see it before. When you become a walking, talking vision of love you will become irresistible to other people who will be drawn to you by your beautiful presence. 
The entire world will benefit from the love you put into practice, as you radiate love out to others and create more happiness and joy wherever you go. The love the world needs is right there inside you -- now, go find it!

117,HEALTHY LIVING,Are Friendships a Key to Longevity?,"Elizabeth Gavino, ContributorAuthor/Speaker/Certified Health Coach",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/friendships-_b_5437478.html,,2014-06-10,HEALTH & WELLNESS,"
Have you found where you feel a sense of belonging -- among a group of people who understand you? Belonging and interacting is a very integral piece to your quality of life and to your health. A few weeks ago, I returned from an incredible weekend of sister- and brother-hood among my ""family"" at our alma mater, New York Military Academy (NYMA). It had been about 25 years since I had seen most of them. When we arrived at alumni weekend and reunited, it was as if no time had passed as we instantly fell back into sync with one another. Looking around the room all I saw were happy faces bonding and reminiscing with their fellow former classmates. It did not matter whether or not we had been in the same circles because we shared a common experience boarding at a military academy. During the weekend, I spent 27 hours laughing, bonding, and catching up with old friends, all of whom I consider family. It is those types of relationships that feed our souls and bring in health.
When Dan Buettner, author of The Blue Zones -- Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest, went around the world searching for areas that had the highest concentration of centenarians, those 100 years old and older, he would ask the centenarians what the secret was to their longevity and they would tell him that socialization was very important to them. When he spoke with Robert Kane, director of the Center on Aging and the Minnesota Geriatric Education Center at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Robert said:
There are some things I'd certainly recommend for what people would call successful aging. One of them is, in fact, to have a sense of social connectedness. Most people enjoy the company of other people, particularly other people who they feel care about them. That seems to give you a sense of well-being, whether that raises your endorphin level or lowers your cortisol level. 
Laughter is so important for cardiovascular health because it reduces stress. When Dan visited the people of Okinawa, he met a group of women who had a moai, loosely translated as ""meeting for a common purpose"" who met regularly to talk, laugh and to support each other. One woman he spoke with said, ""It's much easier to go through life knowing there is a safety net."" Dan writes that, ""On average, an American has only two close friends he or she can count on, recently down from three, which may contribute to an increasing sense of stress."" By contrast, these Okinawan women live almost 8 percent longer than their American counterparts. Why? Because every afternoon, when they get together, they shed all the chronic stress in their lives with each other. 

New York Military Academy was our moai. Cadets entered anywhere from 5th to 12th grade. Imagine living with your friends day in and day out? You do most things together, and you spend time building shared memories. I spent five years with these people, and we had seen each other at our highs and at our lows and shared a common experience that no one outside of our group could relate to or understand. It is through these lifelong bonds that we have a sense of belonging -- of camaraderie -- that makes our stress levels go down, but it is also without these people that we feel sad.
With technology, isolation is becoming more and more prevalent. People are spending more time texting and communicating via electronic devices than meeting in person with their friends. Additionally, if you go to any bar or restaurant, you will see more people engaging on their phones than with each other. Yet I hear every day how lonely and disconnected people are feeling. Just like you, others want to feel heard and to feel special. There is nothing worse than sitting with a friend telling a story while your friend is texting with someone else or more interested in the Facebook feed than in you.   Here are some tips for connecting with others:
Leave the cell phone in your car's glove compartment or turn it off for an hour or two and really connect with the person from whom you are sitting across. I promise there is nothing that important on your phone that won't hold for an hour or so.
Schedule time to meet with your friends. Remember the ladies of Sex in the City? I think women everywhere wished they had great girlfriends as those characters were to each other. You can too, but it requires you to nurture those relationships. Try to coordinate a regular meeting date and time for you and your friends to connect and have some fun together.
Go on Meetup.com and find a group that interests you. If you do not see a group that speaks to your interests, start one! Some of my good friends are people I have met through Meetup groups.
Reach out to a friend or family member you have not spoken to in a while. My cousin and I reconnected a few years back and got to know each other as adults. As a result, we have become very close and we talk very often and laugh and cry together.
There is more to life than technology. Go out there and reconnect with people. Join a sports league or travel group.
Finding your moai will do wonders for your health and your spirits. Go forth and find and connect with your ""moai,"" your ""NYMA,"" your ""family.""

118,HEALTHY LIVING,10 Conversations Every Couple Should Have In The New Year,"Samantha Rodman PhD, ContributorDrPsychMom.com, Clinical Psychologist, Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ten-conversations-every-c_b_6377412.html,"I believe that there are 10 conversations that every couple needs to have on a regular basis in order to keep their emotional connection alive. They can help you realize what areas of their relationship may need to be worked on, whether this is done with more conversation or even with a couples counselor.",2015-01-01,HEALTH & WELLNESS,"There are many articles that enumerate the types of conversations every couple needs to have prior to getting married, such as discussing their plans for how to parent, and their perspectives on money and religion. But I believe that there are 10 conversations that every couple needs to have on a regular basis in order to keep their emotional connection alive. They can help you realize what areas of their relationship may need to be worked on, whether this is done with more conversation or even with a couples counselor. In 2015, why not commit to having at least a few of these helpful conversations?
By the way, if you want to know when you would use these questions, a good thing to do is an Emotional Check In, which is a weekly time (yes, put it on your Outlook) that you and your spouse sit together for a a half hour, no more and no less, to discuss only how the relationship is going. Many couples find this to be useful; it isn't such a long time that the less emotionally expressive partner is terrified, and it is long enough for both people to feel heard. So try a weekly Emotional Check In, and use some of these questions during it. (Note: If you're a devoted reader of this blog, you'll realize that many of these are questions I use in my Functional Couple Fridays interviews. So I walk the walk.)
 We otter ask each other some of these questions
1. What do you love about me? This question is wonderful to use on a regular basis. It makes partners feel great to know that there are specific things about them that are valued and appreciated within their relationship. Talking about this can bring partners back to the honeymoon stage, where all you ever did was talk about what you love about each other (and have sex). This conversation topic pumps out endorphins and makes both partners happy.
2. What do I do regularly that makes you happy? Not only does this give you the happiness benefits of having your effort noticed and recognized, but it can also be instructive to learn exactly what does and doesn't resonate emotionally with your partner. For example, if you're busting your butt to get a delicious dinner on the table every night for your husband, but he never mentions this as something that makes him happy, maybe you can relax and order take out sometimes. This can also lead into a productive discussion about love languages.
3. What is your favorite time we had together this week? Note I didn't say this month or today. A week is a good unit because you can remember most things easily, but some days are going to go by in a normal relationship without many good things happening. If you can't think of any favorite time within seven days, that's an indicator that you need to make more time as a couple, or that there are underlying issues with the relationship. And reminiscing about good times together, even as recently as that morning or a week ago, builds feelings of intimacy and closeness.
4. What are you looking forward to doing together as a couple? Looking forward to events can be even more enjoyable than the events themselves, according to research. So, figure out what you're looking forward to, whether it's tonight, next week, this summer, or as retirees. Or all of those! Talking about your plans together makes you feel like a team, and gives you positive thoughts to help you through tougher times in the relationship.
5. When did you first realize you loved me? Another romantic one that brings you back to the hormone- and endorphin-fueled stages of early love. These sorts of questions make people feel vulnerable and closely connected.
6. What do you think about our sex life? This should be a frank and honest discussion, where both partners try their hardest to be non-defensive and non-judgmental. If it was 20 years from now, wouldn't you wish you had this open discussion today? People have no idea what their partner wants if their partner won't tell them outright. I have treated couples where a man learned that a wife of decades never enjoyed or orgasmed from things he had been doing every time they had sex. Don't let this be you.
7. What do you think we have in common? This discussion builds closeness and a team feeling. Opposites don't actually attract; in most basic ways, couples that succeed are fairly similar. Elaborate on the ways that you have similar thoughts, feelings, goals, values, and interests. This will emphasize that you're a unit, and reaffirm your choice in partner.
8. Which of our differences do you think complement each other? In attachment theory, we've seen that avoidant partners often pair with preoccupied partners. Similarly, assertive partners often pair with passive ones. There are many ways in which two people with the exact same personality traits wouldn't work. One is often more laid back, one more responsible, one more intellectual, one more emotional, and so forth. This conversation helps you learn more about your partner, as well as realize why it may not be a bad thing that your partner is different than you. (Would you want to date you? Really? Completely?)
9. Do you trust me? Many if not most couples have issues in their history that makes them wary of fully trusting the other, whether this is something huge like infidelity, or something like a partner picking their parent over you during arguments. Trust needs to be discussed, and each partner needs to make a good faith effort to repair trust that has been broken. Often, this can be done with a couples counselor, if open discussion does not work.
10. What concrete things could I do to make you happier? This should be one to three things that a partner could reasonably do on a daily or monthly basis that would genuinely increase the other partner's quality of life. Having more sex, cleaning or doing some chore on your wife's timeline and specifications, scheduling more date nights, getting up with the kids, whatever. Be open to trying new things with the goal of enriching your marriage and making your partner feel valued and cherished.
Hopefully those questions can make it into your conversation tonight. Let me know how it goes, and share if you found this useful! Till we meet again, I remain, The Blogapist Who Wants Your Marriage To Be Awesome.

Jonna Roslund, a 26-year-old woman from Sweden, posted two photos on the social sharing site Imgur that perfectly capture this truth. Roslund shared two images of her bedroom ― before she cleaned it and after ― to celebrate how meaningful it was that she found the strength to accomplish a chore. 
“I suffer from severe depression and have a really hard time with cleaning and doing other kinds of household work,” she wrote in the caption. “My room have been this messy for several months because I can’t push myself to take care of it. But this Friday I decided to finally do it!”
(Click through the album to see the photos. Story continues below the images.)
In addition to a lack of motivation, depression also can result in sleep loss, changes in appetite, headaches and more.
“When you’re depressed, it’s a struggle to just get out of bed,” Roslund told Upworthy. “It makes other things that other, healthy people do, so overwhelming. It’s like trying to run a marathon when you’ve been in a coma for years.”
Despite this, there’s still a large stigma surrounding depression, which can prevent individuals living with the condition from seeking professional support. Many people who don’t understand the disorder often equate it with “feeling sad” and something a person can just “get over.”
Roslund’s post is proof that depression is anything but these misconceptions. And, even further, the photos are also the perfect example that success in treating depression can be in the little victories, too.

121,HEALTHY LIVING,Your Weight Is Just a Symptom,"Kerry Tepedino, ContributorKerry Tepedino, International Holistic Health Expert, Speaker,...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/your-weight-is-just-a-sym_b_6565560.html,Getting to the root of your weight issue will begin your healing process to total body freedom forever. You deserve that.,2015-01-29,HEALTH & WELLNESS,"Something really heartbreaking happened this past Saturday.
A lot of people were hitting the beach with friends and family (yes, it was warm where I live) and I, of course, was happy to join them.
I found myself sitting next to a family, and the mom was obviously embarrassed to take off her clothes and be seen in her bathing suit. Her family was in the water playing games, yet she remained covered in her baggy clothes, even in the scorching hot temperatures.
She caught my attention because I used to be the same way, and my heart broke for her. It's painful to live in shame about who you are. I watched as so many lost moments went by that she didn't engage with her family, missing out on creating really great memories.
When I learned strategies to let go of shame, guilt, and self-loathing, my entire life changed. I made better choices with my food, found pleasure in moving my body, deepened my relationships, even created more rewarding job opportunities that I never thought were possible for me before.
You can have this, too!
I want you to feel great in a bathing suit and never worry what others think of you again. I want you to have a deep level of self-respect and self-love, in a way that you've never known before. I want you to look and feel amazing, simply because you're a radiant human being.
The thing I've learned about weight is that it's never really about the weight. The weight is only a symptom to something deeper going on inside. The challenge for most people is discovering what that something is.
Getting to the root of your weight issue will begin your healing process to total body freedom forever. You deserve that.
Even if you have tried a thousand times to lose weight, or you feel it will never work for you, or you believe you've messed up your metabolism, it's time to unveil what's really happening and put an end to it once and for all, so you can live a happy life!
Three Tips To Discover What Your Weight Is Trying To Tell You:
1. Slow down and listen: It's time for you to slow down, my friend, and learn the skill of listening to your body, heart, and soul and actually hearing what they really want. I don't want you to just listen, I want you to also take action. Clear your schedule of things that you aren't passionate about, take time to yourself every day (you can start with five to 10 minutes) to get in touch with you, schedule in you time on your calendar and treat it like an appointment with someone you would never flake on.
2. Master your emotions:If you're turning to food to check out from your feelings (stress, anxiety, sadness, grief, frustration, resentment) then there is most likely some extra weight due to this. Mastering your emotions means that no matter what life throws at you (divorce, bankruptcy, death of a loved one), you are able to stay in control and empowered and not get thrown into the bag of cookies to numb out to what you're feeling. This is a crucial skill to master for long term results with your weight loss.
3. Keep your eye on the goal:You're going to have some growing pains as you get to the root of what's behind your weight. Be kind to yourself and stay consistent. It's very easy to get sidetracked when the going gets tough. Don't let it happen to you again!

122,HEALTHY LIVING,Why More Employers Are Giving Their Employees Fitness Trackers,Leigh Weingus,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/employers-fitness-trackers_us_55cb8d27e4b0f1cbf1e72204,"Less sick days, more productivity.",2015-08-17,HEALTH & WELLNESS,"In 2013, 2,000 firms gave employees fitness trackers, according to BBC. In 2014, that number went up to 10,000.
The oil and gas company BP has given out over 24,000 fitness trackers to its staff, and participants are given fitness goals of one, two or three million steps each year. And by 2016, the U.S. software firm Autodesk -- another firm participating in a health challenge, according to BBC -- predicts that most large companies will be giving out fitness trackers.
So, what's going on?
Of course companies want their employees to be healthy, but they also have another incentive: a healthy staff means fewer sick days and increased productivity.
 ""A habit of regular exercise will help keep you mentally sharper throughout your entire life,"" Robert Pozen, a Harvard professor and author of  Extreme Productivity wrote in a Huffington Post blog, adding, ""People who exercise might have more brain cells than their more sedentary peers -- giving them a major advantage in the workplace.""
As for cutting down on sick days? One study found that people who participated in a daily exercise regimen saw a 40 to 50 precent reduction in respiratory infections, according to Breaking Muscle. 
Another interesting point the BBC makes, and something anyone using a company-distributed activity tracker should be aware of, is that it strips employees of some privacy. Although both BP and Autodesk told BBC that they only have access to aggregated data -- meaning they don't have information on individual activity -- it's still worth noting.

123,HEALTHY LIVING,The Pharma Industry Tried To Justify Drug Prices. We Fact Checked Them.,"Kaiser Health News, ContributorKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-pharma-industry-tried-to-justify-drug-prices-we-fact-checked-them_us_59ce9149e4b06791bb107e19,Drug companies are in the midst of a glossy publicity campaign to stop attempts to control rising pharma costs. But the devil is in the details.,2017-09-29,HEALTH & WELLNESS,"By Jay Hancock | Kaiser Health News
Drug companies launched an ad and publicity extravaganza this year right after President-elect Donald Trump said they “are getting away with murder” on sky-high pill prices.
More than it has in years, the pharmaceutical industry fears major legislation that would curb prices and shrink profits. TV spots lauding drug companies, quoting poet Dylan Thomas and showing heroic scientists have been hard to escape.
But the narrative from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), a trade group, is only the rosiest, most self-serving version of the tale, say critics, and numerous independent authorities question its assertions.
They say the campaign is misleading in these five ways:
1. Lowballing drugs’ cost to society.
For years, PhRMA said retail prescription drugs account for only 10 percent of America’s enormous health care bill. Lately, the group has been using a figure of 14 percent, counting chemotherapy and other drugs delivered in hospitals and doctor offices.
Both numbers downplay the expense of prescription meds. Arriving at the industry’s estimates requires lumping drug costs in with billions in public health spending, such as checking water and animals for pathogens, as well as nursing home care and other categories only loosely connected to the day-to-day job of healing the sick.
Retail drugs alone were 21 percent of the cost in 2014 for employer-sponsored health plans, often exceeding costs for inpatient hospital treatment. Add chemotherapy and other non-pharmacy drugs, and the portion is higher.
At CareFirst, a BlueCross BlueShield plan with members in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia, total drug costs when chemotherapy and other hospital-administered medicines were added became a thumping 34 percent of the expense in the first half of 2017, says CEO Chet Burrell. By contrast, inpatient care, traditionally the most expensive health service, is about 20 percent of CareFirst’s costs.
“That tells you about the power of what’s going on with the drug prices and the degree of use of the drugs,” Burrell said.
2. Exaggerating drug development costs.
Inventing, testing and launching a drug costs $2.6 billion, calculates the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development. The industry substantially finances the center’s work, leading many to question its credibility. Drug companies use its conclusions to justify high prices and cite this figure at every turn.
Outside authorities criticize the research, saying it comes from untestable data, ignores enormous tax subsidies that reduce costs and inflates results with imaginary expenses, such as profits that could have been earned if drug companies invested research dollars elsewhere.
“These estimates are all based on secret, unverifiable numbers of unknown reliability from unknown companies about unnamed drugs,” said Donald Light, a health policy professor at Rowan University in New Jersey.
The Tufts results line up with publicly available data, counters Joseph DiMasi, economic analysis director for the Tufts Center. “If anything, they suggest our estimates are conservative,” he said.
But an independent study published in September using public filings found the median cost of developing 10 cancer drugs was $648 million, while the median revenue per drug was $1.7 billion.
Light and other critics especially object to counting, as part of development costs, the theoretical profit firms might have earned if they put research money into something other than inventing drugs — such as buying extra ads for existing products. That adds more than $1 billion to the supposed cost.
What settles the argument is drugmakers’ audited financial statements, which show that costs of all kinds are far below what they collect in revenue. Ten of the top publicly traded U.S. drug companies earned profits of $83.6 billion last year on revenue of $306 billion, regulatory filings show. That’s a 27 percent pretax profit margin — accomplished even after spending billions on TV ads and salespeople.
3. Cheering too loudly about a slowdown in drug costs.
Fueled partly by hepatitis C medicine costing as much as $1,000 a pill, retail prescription drug spending soared by 12 percent in 2014 and another 9 percent in 2015, according to government data. That was the biggest two-year increase in a decade.
So it’s no surprise growth is reverting to the mean now that there are fewer new blockbusters. Government figures aren’t in yet for 2016. But QuintilesIMS, which tracks wholesaler sales, says drug spending grew 4.8 percent last year.
“The slowest rate in years,” brags PhRMA, quoting a magazine. Actually, drug-spending growth was even lower from 2010 to 2013 before roaring back.
In any case, 4.8 percent is still twice the inflation rate for 2016 and greater than economic growth, which determines what the country can afford over the long term.
New drugs arriving to market, often involving living cells and gene therapy, look more expensive than ever. The announced cost for Novartis’ Kymriah therapy for kids with leukemia is $475,000 for a one-time treatment.
Drug companies seem to show concern about high prices only when there’s a danger Congress might do something about them. In January, AbbVie loudly promised to keep price increases under 10 percent this year. Now that political pressure has subsided, company executives said recently they have more “flexibility” to revert “to double-digit increases in 2018 and beyond,” according to a Sept. 22 report from Leerink, an investment research firm.
AbbVie subsequently said Leerink “incorrectly characterized” the remarks. The drugmaker promised to make “one, single-digit price increase” for 2018.
4. Exaggerating the role of generics.  
“Nearly 90 percent of all medicines dispensed in the United States are generics,” says PhRMA, trying to argue drugs are cheap.
The group doesn’t mention that brand-name medicines are responsible for 74 percent of prescription costs and that drugmakers do everything in their legal power to keep pills from going generic after patents expire.
“PhRMA has fought for years to keep generics off the market,” said Robin Feldman, a law professor who researched the subject for a book, “Drug Wars,” published in June, which she co-authored. “The brunt of the pain of that is felt by U.S. citizens,” who pay more for medicine than anybody in the world, she said.
Industry tactics have included paying makers of generics not to make pills; filing dubious petitions opposing generics that cause months of delay; withholding samples that generics companies need to launch their own pills; and changing dosages or delivery mechanisms in tiny ways to get a new patent, Feldman said.
5. Exaggerating benefits from new drugs. 
“Since 2000, biopharmaceutical companies have brought more than 500 new medicines to U.S. patients, resulting in significant progress against some of the most costly and challenging diseases,” says one of PhRMA’s promotions.
Rather than being breakthroughs, however, too many new drugs are “me-too” substances based on previous research, critics say. Many aren’t demonstrably better than cheaper, already available drugs yet get heavily promoted through expensive ads and salespeople.
Bernard Munos worked for years at Eli Lilly and now is a consultant and sits on the board of several small, drug-related companies. He credits the industry with creating drugs that “are superb and make a difference,” such as Gleevec, Novartis’ blood-cancer drug.
But there are not nearly enough of them, he says.
“One of the challenges of the industry is that, despite all of its efforts, it has not been successful in producing more of the really transformative drugs,” he said. “Mediocre drugs are starting to price themselves at almost the same level as the really innovative drugs. And this is a market failure.”

This is awesome, and pots of gold are too. But the problem with only focusing on having that pot of gold is that you completely miss the rainbow you followed to get there.
Not only did you miss the rainbow -- aka, the journey, once you've gotten your pot of gold, then what?
On to the next pot I guess. Only this time, it needs to be a bigger pot, a shiner pot, in order for you to feel as fulfilled as you did when you got that first pot of gold. A bigger goal to satisfy your inner goal junkie.
As cool as this would be to actually have pots of gold, does this actually make us happy? Would it really create a sense of purpose and fulfillment? We only need to look at Hollywood's rich and famous to know that an abundance of wealth (even when coupled with an abundance of adoring fans) is no guarantee for happiness.
Of course, being poor doesn't make you happy either, but the point here isn't to talk about having a real pot of gold, it's simply a metaphor for reaching whatever goal we are striving to achieve.
But here's the thing: We dream about having that pot of gold, being in that dream job or having that ideal relationship, because of how we think we will FEEL as a result of having that thing or living that life.
Yet have you ever reached a goal and felt great for a few days, maybe even a few weeks, but sooner or later you end up feeling a little empty, or lacking direction?
This is probably due to one of two reasons; your focus was all about reaching the end game, not about the journey you took to achieve your goal, and secondly, you didn't actually want the goal itself, you wanted the lifestyle, or more accurately, you wanted the feelings that you thought would come with having that goal.
In other words, you were looking for something external, be it a bank balance, a spouse, or a championship title, to feel fulfilled. But of course, true happiness and fulfillment can never come from something outside of you. It has to come from within.
So what does this mean? How can we leverage this insight to create goals that serve us in more than just a superficial way? How can we set goals that allow us to know ourselves more intimately and to create a deeper sense of personal fulfillment and satisfaction?
I'm going to use my recent goal of wanting to become a boxing champ to illustrate.
On the surface, this boxing goal looks like it's purely ego driven- a need to be the best. It is a goal fueled by competition, comparing myself to all the other females in my weight division and working to be better than them. Not just to be good, but the best. That's all ego, right? To dominate. To compare. To conquer.
Whilst that is the end goal, it's actually THE JOURNEY that I'm most interested in.
What type of person must I become in order to become the best? What new skills must I develop? What dedication and commitment must I display, ongoing, to transition from crap to being able to master the techniques I need? What fears must I overcome? What new depths of courage must I reach? What doubts must I learn to silence? What beliefs must I instill within my heart and at my very core?
This process is the real reward. The boxing title, if it comes, will simply be confirmation that I have reached these stepping stones along the journey.
The determination, the wanting, the chasing, the learning, the growing, the pushing, the doubting, the believing, the training, the sweating, the burning, the yearning, the friendships forged, the battles fought, the sacrifices made. The daring to want. The knowing of self. These are the real rewards.
When you know this to be true, the rainbow is no longer the means to an end. Instead, the rainbow becomes your pot of gold. And you can revel in that rainbow, every step of the way.
The pot of gold at the end is just a bonus.

125,HEALTHY LIVING,4 Uncommon But Serious Ear Infection Complications,"Deborah M. Burton, MD, ContributorPhysician, Mother, Blogger",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/4-uncommon-but-serious-ear-infection-complications_us_58a0e512e4b0cd37efcfea29,Ear infection complications can happen when the infections become severe or recurrent. I already discussed common myths about,2017-02-12,HEALTH & WELLNESS,"Ear infection complications can happen when the infections become severe or recurrent. I already discussed common myths about ear infections and shared ear infection facts that I believe parents should know.
Ear infection complications can be divided into the common and the uncommon types.
Common ear infection complications include temporary hearing loss, speech delay, dizziness, balance problems and sensory processing and learning disorders.
Uncommon ear infection complications happen because of long term problems that have not been successfully treated or where symptoms seemed to go away. Without significant symptoms, it can be hard to know if a more serious problem is developing.
When kids suffer from ear infections for many years, they get used to ear symptoms and stop complaining about them. Kids are tough! They often say: It’s not bad, and I can handle it.
You do not want your child to “handle” ear problems. If your child’s ear infections do not happen as often as they used to, you need to understand that the ear problems should completely go away.
If ear infections keep happening, annual ear exams and hearing tests with an Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) doctor allows for better evaluations.
Although these problems are not common, children (and adults!) with chronic ear infections may develop one or more of these severe ear infection complications.
1. Chronic hearing loss
I am not talking about the temporary hearing loss that is caused by fluid buildup or swelling behind the ear drum that happens with routine ear infections.
A persistent hearing loss may happen because of scarring on the ear drum, or scar tissue that builds up around the tiny hearing bones of the ear.
This type of hearing loss is called a conductive hearing loss because sound has trouble reaching the hearing nerve.
Conductive hearing loss can be treated with surgery or hearing aids.
2. Ear drum perforation (hole in ear drum)
Again, I am not talking about a tiny hole that happens when an ear drum ruptures during a new ear infection. After an ear infection is treated, most ear drum ruptures completely heal.
Chronic ear drum perforations become more serious problems when they fail to close up. The perforation may become large enough that the ear drum cannot move correctly.
Ear drum movement improves the way sound reaches the hearing nerve. So, a large hole in the ear drum becomes another cause of the conductive hearing loss discussed above.
Ongoing ear infections cause repeated episodes of ear drainage through an ear drum perforation.
Chronic ear drum perforations are treated by repairing the hole with surgery.
3. Mastoiditis (MASS-stoid-EYE-tuss)
The mastoid bone, which sits behind the ear, is made of air spaces that help drain the middle ear fluid. When the mastoid cells become infected or inflamed, mastoiditis develops.
During new painful ear infections, acute mastoiditis may occur. Swelling on the bone behind the ear may indicate an emergency where hospitalization and IV antibiotics are needed. Other treatments include emergency ear drainage and possible removal of infected bone
Chronic mastoiditis is more difficult to diagnose because swelling slowly develops and ear pain is often not present. The trapped infection leads to severe complications because bone is slowly destroyed.
The mastoid bone separates the ear from the brain. When bone erosion happens, chronic middle ear infections can spread causing meningitis or a brain abscess.
Chronic mastoiditis requires surgical treatment.
4. Cholesteatoma (KO-less-TEA-uh-TOE-muh)
A cholesteatoma is a collection of skin cells inside the middle ear that can happen because of recurring ear infections.
If it is not treated, a cholesteatoma can eventually damage many structures deep inside the ear.
Symptoms of cholesteatoma can be similar to some of the other complications discussed. If there is a chronic ear drum perforation with recurrent ear drainage and hearing loss, a cholesteatoma may be present.
In addition to slowly eroding the hearing bones and bones near the brain, the cholesteatoma can also erode the area with the hearing nerve, leading to permanent nerve damage hearing loss.
Damage to the nerve that moves the face muscles can also occur.
Cholesteatoma treatment always includes surgery.
*****
Ear infections are very common in childhood and most kids outgrow them. However, if children continue to have ear infections off and on as they get older, consider an ENT evaluation to be sure a more serious, slowly developing complication does not occur.
Ear infections can lead to more serious problems and are not always as innocent as many people believe.

Shortly after I started freelancing,2016-08-20,HEALTH & WELLNESS,"I’ve always wanted to see South Africa’s majestic wildlife and to truly be one with nature. Shortly after I started freelancing for a safari tour operator, I seized the opportunity and asked my husband if we should go to South Africa next summer. His answer? “Why not?” I quickly booked the flight before he changed his mind and soon heard the African drum beats in my head.
The first person I told was my Mom since we both shared a love of animals. In fact, she was preparing to go on her own dream vacation: six weeks in Australia and New Zealand.
Two weeks after I booked my flight, my Mom told me that she had a tumor near the optic nerve of her left eye. She got approvals from two doctors to go on her trip before the surgery. Her priorities were set! So she went and had an incredible time.
I flew from Germany where I live to visit my Mom in Florida for 10 days. We wanted to see each other before her surgery, just in case.
Her surgery was then scheduled a week before my trip. Not the timing of my choice, but this wasn’t about me. I couldn’t blame her for wanting the tumor out immediately. I probably would have done the same thing. 
The night before her surgery, she told me that if anything happened, to have an incredible time in Africa. I just laughed it off and said, “I’m sure nothing will happen, Mom, you’ll do just fine.” But I wasn’t sure. I was scared.
We all held our breath that day. She pulled through and was released from the hospital three days later. However, I thought her discharge was too soon. It didn’t feel right, so I questioned it, but my Mom was an RN and she assured me she’d be OK. 
I talked to my Mom twice after her surgery. She had a very deep voice and sounded exhausted, but was OK. She mentioned that Gigi, their sweet dog, lied by her side and didn’t move an inch since she got home.
She also told me to have a great time in Africa and to send her photos. We both said “I love you” and “Goodbye.” 
My family and I arrived in Johannesburg on July 20. At around midnight that same night, the phone rang. My heart stopped when I saw that it was my mother’s husband. I knew he wasn’t calling to say hi. My Mom passed away two hours prior from a starburst blood clot which caused both a pulmonary embolism and a massive heart attack.
Reality didn’t set in that night, not even after Skyping with my sister. We were both in shock, but I had to make a decision. 
What should I do? I had two choices: Cancel our vacation and fly to Florida or continue with our trip as planned.
I remembered that my Mom told me to enjoy my trip, no matter what, but still, it didn’t feel right. How could I enjoy a vacation right after losing her? That’s impossible and just plain wrong! Right? On the other hand, I know how negatively she would react if I were to ignore her last wish.
I discussed it with my family and we decided that I should stay in Africa and fly to Florida later.
I felt guilty though. I felt guilty for not personally being there for my Mom’s husband. I felt guilty for not being with my sister. I felt guilty for not crying much. But I also feel that everyone has the right to mourn in his or her own way. I apparently don’t need tears. I need hugs. I need to write. I need comfort food. I need nature, animals and music. So maybe the best place for me to be was in Africa.
And guess what? My Mom was with me the entire time.
The first time I felt my Mom’s presence was in Balule Game Reserve near Kruger National Park on our sunset game drive. It was pitch black and then bam! There they were, a family of elephants, right in the middle of the rugged path. My heart stopped again. It was exactly 24 hours after Mom passed.
There was one female and four younger elephants of all different stages of life. Our guide said that the female adult was about to give birth any minute/day. I just kept whispering, “oh my God, oh my God” as tears swelled up in my eyes. It was one of the most magical moments I’ve ever experienced.
You never forget your first elephant sighting and I’m so glad Mom was with me for it.
Every time I saw something amazing, I thought ‘Wow, I can’t wait to tell Mom about this!’ Then I remembered and whispered, “damn.” This happened several times a day.
I’m still in denial.
I’ve realized though that it was a good thing that I stayed. It gave me the much needed peace and quiet time to think about my Mom, to feel numb, to stare off into space, and to lose a lot of sleep. I was also distracted by the wonders of nature and that, right there, brought me closer to her and I’m very grateful for that.
Now, here I sit, in a small, uncomfortable seat on the airplane taking me home. I’m a bit scared though. What if I don’t feel her presence anymore? How do I face reality and move on to the anger phase? Can I even skip the anger phase? How can I start working again tomorrow?
The fact is, death is a part of life and I have to deal with it, whether I want to or not, just like everyone else who has lost someone very special.
Being on vacation has helped me to begin the grieving process and I realized that’s exactly what I needed.
ps. Thank you, Mom, for accompanying me in Africa. I hope you too enjoyed our time together. I love you. God speed.

128,POLITICS,Go Run! How to Close the Gender Gap in Politics by Encouraging Young Girls to Consider Careers in Public Service,"Elsie Owolo, ContributorPolicy wonk, educator, former local and national campaign staf...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/go-run-how-to-close-the-g_b_5602230.html,It is only a start in how the electorate of this nation can start to change the dynamics of our political system. It also places the power to close the gender gap in politics in the hands of the people.,2014-07-22,POLITICS,"With presidential candidacy announcements a year away and a highly anticipated 2016 presidential race, the desire to see a woman as the president of the United States is stronger than ever. This is evident as former supporters of Hillary R. Clinton have started the Ready for Clinton grassroots organization. Without a formal announcement from the former Senator and Secretary of State, they have developed a strong grassroots operation to strongly encourage Clinton to throw her hat into the ring. 
It is clear that the electorate is ready for women to be political leaders at the highest levels. This was first seen in 1992, a year that was dubbed ""The Year of the Woman"" because of the historic amount of women elected to the United States Congress. In the 2012 elections, 20 women were elected to the United States Senate. Consequently, the 113th Congress started with the most number of women elected to the Senate in the history of our nation.
While women have ascended to high power leadership positions in numerous fields, such as politics, business, and law, we still see a lack of equal representation in politics. Women make up 50% of the population and yet hold only a small percentage of seats in state and national legislatures. Currently, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the United States is ranked 84th in the world in terms of women's political representation in national legislatures. The legislatures in the United States do not accurately reflect the American population. Yet, it is the citizens of this nation that have the most power in changing the face of politics. 
Studies have shown that political ambition starts at a very early age. However, the documentary Miss Representation shows that between the ages of 7 and 15, the amount of girls who declare that they want to be the President of the United States drastically diminishes. It is evident that in order to close the gender gap in American politics, one has to appeal to the ambition of young female leaders. 
We, as the electorate, play a role in bringing about parity and closing the gender gap in American politics. Listed below are three ways in which a young girl can be encouraged to start considering a future as an elected official.
1. Encourage girls and young women to run for office by asking them!
According to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, women need to be recruited in order to run for statewide and national offices. In order to reach the women who would make strong political leaders and close the gap in political ambition, this recruitment should start early. Young girls need to hear from parents, teachers, and other individuals close to them that they have the skills to become great political leaders. The idea that they can be elected to the highest office of the land should be something that should be equally instilled as often in young women as it is in young men.
2. Get girls prepared by having them attend political trainings.
There are a number of organizations that work toward demystifying running for office, for political newcomers. National organizations for youth include Running Start, IGNITE, as well as other local programs that train girls to pursue elective office. Young women can move forward as they seriously consider running for office, to be trained by organizations that prepare women for public office. This includes Yale University's Women's Campaign School and the Ready to Run Campaign with Rutgers University. The result of these trainings has been the candidacy and election of some of the nation's most prominent and female politicians.
Many of these organizations introduce the young women to a variety of fields in the political sphere and encourage them to pursue leadership in politics. These organizations are dedicated to training the next generation of women leaders at the state and national level.
3. Expose young girls to women civic leadership in the community.
In order for young girls to aspire to be political leaders, they first need to see women that have been successful in pursuing careers as elected officials. It is the responsibility of our schools and families to take girls to town hall meetings, state capitols, and participate in other opportunities where they can visibly see women leaders in the political realm. It is with the visibility of these strong leaders that our girls will start to envision a new option for their future. It is also by interacting with these women that possible mentoring relationships, which are critical to being successful as a politician, can be developed.
The above list on how to get young women to consider politics as a career option is not exhaustive. This is only the beginning of a conversation on how to change the political ambition of young women. It is only a start in how the electorate of this nation can start to change the dynamics of our political system. It also places the power to close the gender gap in politics in the hands of the people. While much more can be done, the task of creating equal representation in the United States legislature is within reach, with the identification, training, and mentoring of young women.

A number of those who voted for President Barack Obama flipped to vote for Donald Trump, and some voters who hadn’t turned out in recent cycles came out for Trump. Clinton lost Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania in part due to her weakness among white, working-class voters, while winning a strong majority of the Latino and black vote.
Democratic lawmakers have spent the last few days listening to the people in their districts before returning to Washington, D.C., next week. 
Rep. Marc Veasey, of Texas, says his black and Latino constituents there are telling him they feel “unwelcome.” 
Rep. Raul Grijalva (Ariz.) wants to know what the Democratic National Committee does now. 
In Arizona, Rep. Ruben Gallego said, he saw white men in a pick-up truck cheering and waving a Confederate flag out of their window. 
And Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) had always anticipated an enthusiasm gap ― “Barack Obama was a Jackie Robinson moment for African Americans” ― but not one like this. 
For all four, the unknowns about what lies ahead are daunting.
“People want to know exactly what a Trump presidency is going to mean,” Veasey told The Huffington Post two days after the election. 
Veasey plans to talk to his colleagues who represent the rural Americans in the Rust Belt states and ask them why they think voters went for Trump. Because in his district there is “a lot of shock.” 
“Some of our friends who are white and conservative, or apolitical, and they supported Trump, don’t understand the fact that for a lot of people in the African-American and Latino community, a lot of the things said by the Republican nominee were very hurtful, and very painful,” Veasey said. 
Throughout the campaign, Trump told black voters that they had nothing to lose because they were “living in hell,” and vowed to be a “law and order” president. The day he announced his candidacy, Trump said Mexico was sending criminals and “rapists” to the U.S. Later in the cycle, he questioned the credibility of an American-born federal judge based on his Mexican heritage. He vowed to build a wall along America’s southern border and increase deportations. He called for a ban on all Muslims from entering the U.S. ― a proposal he has since walked back. 
The fact that half of those who voted elected Trump to the office of the presidency makes blacks, Latinos and other minorities “feel unwelcome,” Veasey said.
“It makes them scared about the future for themselves and their children,” he added. “We need to understand why for a certain segment of the country those sorts of things were really just not a big deal to them.” 
Veasey traveled throughout the election, stumping for Clinton, working to get out the vote. But no one asked him to go to Michigan, he said. No one ever thought there was going to be an issue with the Rust Belt states. “Everyone was completely caught off guard by that,” he said.
At a breakfast with family two days after the election, Grijalva said the atmosphere was “somber.”
“There was no quick chatter,” he said. And the “sense of isolation ― of ‘damn, we lost’ ― is palatable,” he said of Latinos in his district. 
“We had all of ourselves convinced, and I include myself in that, that this guy couldn’t win,” Grijalva said, noting that the party failed to recognize that rural America is hurting economically. He praised the grassroots campaigning of organizations like Voto Latino, and Mi Familia Voto, which helped boost registration in key states, and said that without them the turnout would have been even lower. 
“Which begs the question, what does the DNC do?” he said. “We need to clean house over there.”
Grijalva faulted party officials for sticking to a middle-of-the-road strategy, and is backing progressive Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) to be the new chair. 
“That DNC vehicle has got to change, it’s got to become more multi-ethnic, multicultural. And that means new leadership, and a new board,” he said. “I’m backing Keith because he would bring that inclusion process, and new creative people.”
Every aspect of the party needs to re-evaluate its positions, Grijalva said. Leaders of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus can’t afford to be quiet. “If they’re middle of the road, and quiet, and don’t take a position, that’s not helpful to our community,” he said. 
And if the DNC is “just sitting there on the sidelines, what good does it do us?” 
“They were still counseling candidates not to get too immersed in the immigration issue ― I mean, Jesus,” he said of party officials. 
There’s no doubt in Grijalva’s mind that Trump will refuse to renew Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which allows undocumented people who came to the U.S. as children to get temporary work authorization.
“This is about raw power that [Trump] has, and this is about how you resist that,” he continued. “You can’t have somebody trying to play the middle when he’s undoing DACA.”
Gallego, who represents Arizona’s 7th District, also worried about DACA’s future. 
“Here is a man who has clearly used racist language, and questioned the credibility of Mexican Americans,” Gallego said. 
That makes him fearful for his constituents. “They feel very uncomfortable,” he said. “[Trump] has made very clear to them how he feels about Latinos.”
Democrats are already trying to figure out what methods they have at their disposal to block Trump’s efforts to undo DACA and protect those who are currently its recipients from deportation, Gallego said. 
The party will also have a lot of soul-searching to do when lawmakers return, given the election outcome. 
“We are going to have a very spirited DNC chairmanship election,” Gallego said. “We need to examine all of the leadership roles within the Democratic party as well as policies to make sure we are putting together a combination to win not just in presidential years but in all elections.” 
Jeffries plans to keep one eye on how Trump runs the White House and another on 2018. 
“If Donald Trump governs in the way he campaigns, it’s important for communities of color to rebuke him and take back control of Congress,” he said. 
Jeffries expressed disappointment that more voters did not come out to defend Obama’s legacy, but took some comfort in the fact that everyone will be watching Republicans now. 
“They can no longer falsely blame Obama, because they are in charge of the entire capital city,” he said. 
“Look, Americans have often overcome adversity,” Jeffries said. “We’ve gone through slavery, we’ve gone through Jim Crow, the Cuban missile crisis, and 9/11 ― we can overcome a Donald Trump presidency.”

They spoke no English; they had no special skills. And they had a child born two days after they,2017-08-09,POLITICS,"My parents were immigrants. They spoke no English; they had no special skills. And they had a child born two days after they got off Ellis Island. That would be me. They were eastern European, WWII refugees. During WWII, they were wretched refuse and tempest-tossed. They were tired. They were homeless. And they yearned to breathe free.
For my father, there was no other country to come to besides the U.S. It was and remained for him the greatest country in the world. Some of our relatives emigrated elsewhere. They did not want to go through the wait it took to get in here. But he would go nowhere else. He believed in the promise of the U.S. He believed that if he worked hard, he could make a better life for his family. It took four years, but he and my pregnant mother were finally allowed in.
How did it work out? My childhood was spent in the South Bronx with other immigrants from a different part of the world but with similar dreams. We were poor. My father worked hard. My mother raised us with the belief that, in this country, you did not have to start with privilege. You could make it on your own if you had talent and worked hard. My parents learned English. They became citizens. It was the proudest day of their lives. My father is gone but my mother is still here, still reads a book a week (in English) and still says that this is the greatest country on the planet.
And what happened to the children of these immigrants? Did we go on welfare? I have two sisters. One is a physician, the other is an attorney. I have a Ph.D. in psychology. We are all gainfully employed. We pay taxes and love our country. We are not unique. There are millions like us and have been throughout the history of this country. This is the promise and the dream of America. This is part of the greatness of America.
But now I read that some would have it so that my parents would no longer be welcome here. Senators Perdue and Cotton, with the support of our President, who himself is the grandchild of immigrants who could not speak English and had no special skills, tell us that people like my parents would compete with native-born Americans or go on welfare. Implicit is that they would never learn English. Better we should let in skilled workers and highly educated people who somehow will not compete for “American” jobs. Or, if they do, at least they will be well spoken.
The Statue of Liberty is not the Statue of English fluency and international commerce. The statue and our country are about liberty and opportunity and the belief that, given a fair shake, most of us can succeed and deserve the chance to try. Hard working immigrants were and are a tribute to the reality of the American dream and to what that dream has meant to the world. This bill is a slap in their face and an insult to the American dream.

131,POLITICS,Rep. Elijah Cummings: Police-Community Relations Is The 'Civil Rights Cause Of This Generation',Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elijah-cummings-baltimore-protests_n_7147164.html,,2015-04-26,POLITICS,"
Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said on Sunday that the relationship between law enforcement and ordinary citizens is ""the civil rights cause of this generation"" -- remarks that came just hours after protesters took to the streets of Baltimore to protest the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who recently died after sustaining injuries in police custody.
""This whole police community relations situation, Bob, is the civil rights cause of this generation, no doubt about it,"" Cummings told CBS' Bob Schieffer on ""Face the Nation."" 
Baltimore police said on Sunday that they had arrested about 34 people and that six police officers were injured during the protests.
Gray, 25, died on April 19, a week after he was arrested by police. Authorities are still piecing together the circumstances of Gray's arrest, but thus far, no evidence has emerged that he was doing anything illegal at the time.
Baltimore officials are investigating how Gray sustained fatal injuries, including a severed spinal cord, while he was in police custody. The Department of Justice is also investigating whether there is enough evidence to bring a prosecutable civil rights charge against the Baltimore police.
Cummings said Sunday that the protests, some of which took place in his own neighborhood, had been largely peaceful. He said much of the violence had been instigated by a ""few people, mainly from out of town."" On Saturday evening, the Baltimore Police Department said something similar, tweeting that ""isolated pockets of people from out of town"" were ""causing disturbances.""

132,POLITICS,Friday Talking Points -- Selenofriggatriskaidekaphobics Unite!,"Chris Weigant, ContributorPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/friday-talking-points_b_5493984.html,"Iraq is self-destructing. This led the Wall Street Journal to call for a few airstrikes and some American paratroopers to fix the problem, because we all know how well that turned out the last time, right?",2014-06-14,POLITICS,"I have to begin this week by apologizing for the irreverent nature of that title, but then how often do you get a chance to coin a cool word like ""selenofriggatriskaidekaphobia""? 
The proper answer is that the chance won't come again until 2049, which explains why we couldn't resist. The word is a mashup of two phobias, the fear of a full moon (selenophobia) and the fear of Friday the 13th (friggatriskaidekaphobia, not to be confused with fear of the number 13, which is just triskaidekaphobia, of course). The rare occurrence of a full moon on a Friday the 13th won't happen again for another 35 years, so today's pretty much it for this generation of selenofriggatriskaidekaphobics, at least. But enough of this looney etymological fun, let's get on with a week chock-full of political happenings, shall we?
Hillary Clinton apparently has a new book out, as anyone within sight of a television learned this week. This would have been the big story this week, except a whole bunch of other stuff happened which overshadowed Hillary's book tour. By week's end, the Clinton news had even moved on to astonishment that Chelsea Clinton was being paid a whopping $600,000 a year to produce the occasional puff piece for NBC News. Nice work, if you can get it, eh?
Another story which faded fast was the Bowe Bergdahl saga, even though his girlfriend released his handwritten journals to the Washington Post, which gave a glimpse inside his troubled mind.
An amendment to weaken ""trucker fatigue"" standards for professional truck drivers was debated in the Senate, mere days before Tracy Morgan's limo was hit by a trucker who had reportedly been awake for more than 24 hours. This was indeed an ironic twist of fate, but we refuse to make cheap jokes about an accident which killed one of Morgan's friends.
The Drug Enforcement Agency, according to a new report, has been intentionally hindering research on marijuana for four decades, which should come as a surprise to nobody. The key takeaway from the story:
[The new report] also criticizes the agency for creating a ""regulatory Catch-22"" by arguing there is not enough scientific evidence to support rescheduling marijuana while simultaneously impeding the research that would produce such evidence.A spokesperson at the DEA declined to comment on the report.
In Nevada, ""None of these candidates"" won the Democratic primary election for the nomination to run against the well-liked governor, Brian Sandoval. This is partly due to the fact that Sandoval is likely to win re-election no matter who runs against him, but it's still pretty funny for ""none of the above"" to win an election (due to Nevada's quirky ballots, which always include this option).
President Obama is visiting an Indian reservation today (the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Nation), becoming only the third president in American history ever to do so (Clinton did so in 1999, and F.D.R. was the first). From the story, which most of the media is likely to ignore:
Obama is making his first visit as president to an Indian reservation, where he will tout the strides his administration has made with Native Americans, unveil new education and economic measures aimed at Native Americans and speak of the difficult work that remains to pull many tribal members out of crippling poverty and endemic unemployment.Many tribal leaders say Obama has done more in six years for Native Americans than all of his predecessors combined. The administration has given land back to tribes, worked one-on-one with tribal governments and is cracking down on crime in Indian Country. ""The best thing that's happened to Indian Country has been President Obama being elected,"" said Dave Archambault II, chairman of Standing Rock.
In other Native American news, a television ad called ""Proud To Be"" was run during a basketball championship game which featured many Native Americans stating what they are proud to be called. The ad ends with: ""Native Americans call themselves many things. The one thing they don't..."" which then shows a picture of a Washington Redskins football helmet. You can see the full two-minute version of this powerful ad in the story at Huffington Post.
In international news, Iraq is self-destructing. This led the Wall Street Journal to call for a few airstrikes and some American paratroopers to fix the problem, because we all know how well that turned out the last time, right? The Maliki government has dug its own grave, and now it is about to lie in it. Obama, thankfully, stated that there would be no new American boots on the ground any time soon.
OK, what else? What's that? Something about Virginia? Oh, right! This week marked the 47th anniversary of the Loving v. Virginia Supreme Court case which threw out all the racist miscegenation laws that still remained on the books, and allowed people to get married no matter what their skin color. Certainly a milestone to celebrate!
I am kidding, of course, because there were two big stories out of Virginia this week, and they were both pretty stunning. First there was the Democratic state senator who was bribed into quitting by state Republicans, so that his daughter could be confirmed as a judge and also so he could get a plum job on the state tobacco board. When the story broke, Phillip Puckett hastily withdrew his name for consideration from the tobacco gig, but the upshot is that the Virginia state senate went from a 20-20 political split to 20-19.
Even a story about such naked political bribery was quickly overshadowed, however, by the first House Majority Leader ever (since the position was created in 1899, mind you) to lose his primary election. Yes, Eric Cantor's days haunting the halls of the Capitol are indeed now numbered. Since so much has already been written about this political earthquake, we'll just summarize the high points quickly.
The immediate reaction was one of shock and surprise. The reason for Cantor's loss was endlessly theorized over (including the possible ""Cooter effect"" -- the most amusing theory yet), but the emerging conventional wisdom was that it was due to Cantor's all-but-non-existent support for immigration reform. Upon closer examination, this was likely not the core reason for his defeat, but that's not going to matter to House Republicans, who are likely to avoid voting on any immigration bill until pork barrels grow wings (or at least until 2017). Even though an actual supporter of immigration reform (Senator Lindsey Graham) handily won his own primary against multiple Tea Partiers.
Cantor immediately announced his resignation as Majority Leader, effective next month. The vote to replace him will take place next Thursday, Speaker John Boehner announced. The jockeying for the number two position in the House began immediately, but a funny thing happened on the way to the Tea Party -- the man in the number three position looks likely to take over from Cantor, even though he is even more centrist than Cantor ever was. Several candidates more acceptable to the Tea Partiers put their names forward, and then hastily withdrew (after counting noses). First to bow out was Jeb Hensarling, followed by fellow Texan Pete Sessions. Today, Raul Labrador from Idaho announced he's in the running, but it's looking like Californian Kevin McCarthy may already have enough votes to win next week. The entire scramble has reminded many of a high school class president election -- nothing more than a ferocious bout of gladhandling and backslapping to win a popularity contest.
We've got almost a full week before the (secret ballot) votes are counted, so who knows what will happen next in this fast-moving story? Stay tuned!
President Obama deserves at least an Honorable Mention for his visit to the Standing Rock Sioux Nation, especially considering this is only the third such visit ever.
Attorney General Eric Holder also deserves an Honorable Mention, for officially supporting a proposal by the U.S. Sentencing Commission to lessen the sentences of low-level drug offenders currently in federal prisons (making sentencing reform retroactive, in other words). Holder continues to show that he has had a true change of heart on the whole War On Drugs issue, and for that he deserves credit.
But we're going to hand the Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week to Senator Elizabeth Warren, for getting very close to passing a bill which would reform student loans. Her bill ultimately failed to clear the filibuster hurdle by a vote of 56-38, but this really should be read as 57-37 (Harry Reid had to vote ""no"" so that the bill can be reintroduced later, for technical reasons). Three Republicans crossed the aisle and voted with Democrats, meaning the bill could pass if only three more follow suit. While the loss was a disappointment, the closeness of the vote was impressive enough for her to win this week's MIDOTW award.
[Congratulate Senator Elizabeth Warren on her Senate contact page, to let her know you appreciate her efforts.]
There were, unfortunately, a number of candidates for Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week this week. The weirdest one can't even really be called a Democrat, since he obviously is trying to game the election system -- he ran and lost several races in Arizona as a Republican, and then decided not only to reregister as a Democrat but to actually change his name to ""Cesar Chavez."" The grandson of the more-famous bearer of that name is suing to get this guy off the Democratic primary ballot. ""Chavez"" (né Scott Fistler) deserves at least a (Dis-)Honorable Mention, no matter what party he really hails from.
A group of Rhode Island state senators deserve a group (Dis-)Honorable Mention, for acting like Republicans this week. They're pushing a bill that would block any local laws which raise the minimum wage -- an action normally taken by Republicans to pre-empt more progressive city laws from taking effect.
Debbie Wasserman Schultz, normally a quite progressive politician, deserves her own (Dis-)Honorable Mention this week for coming out against a proposed medical marijuana ballot initiative in her home state of Florida. The reaction from Americans for Safe Access, and from a guy described as ""one of the state's major Democratic donors"" was swift:
A 30-second ASA ad stated that Wasserman Schultz ""thinks it's okay for medical marijuana patients to go to federal prison.""[John] Morgan, whose family members have used marijuana for debilitating pain, said he raised $250,000 for Wasserman Schultz at his home a couple of years ago. ""I will never let her come to my house again for a huge fundraiser,"" Morgan said.
Let this be a warning to Democrats everywhere -- the people are leading on this issue. This is one major method successfully used by gay rights supporters to get Democrats on board -- withholding previously-generous donations to politicians. Democrats, please take note.
But the Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week just has to go to Virginia state senator (ex-senator, now) Phillip P. Puckett, the guy who was bribed by Republicans to quit his elected position for nothing more than a job offer and a vote on his daughter's judicial future. Even if he had reaped these rewards, it would likely not have been illegal under Virginia's lax political ethics laws, but that's immaterial. Whether the law says so or not, such a deal would have been unethical by pretty much any standard. He should truly be ashamed of himself, and he has clearly earned this week's MDDOTW award.
[Phillip Puckett is now a private citizen, and it is our standing policy not to provide contact information for such people, sorry.]
Volume 308 (6/13/14)
Quite the mixed bag this week, for our talking points. We could have written seven of these just on the Cantor upset alone, but decided that would have been too unseemly. Instead, we limited our Cantor glee to only two, because other things were indeed happening this week that need pointing out.
As always, these are offered up for Democrats everywhere to freely use, whether during a television interview or around your workplace's water cooler. In other words, these are for everyone from high-ranking politicians to the selenofriggatriskaidekaphobics among us!
 Congress can act fast!
This is worth pointing out -- because it disproves a piece of conventional inside-the-Beltway wisdom.
""For all the talk of divided government, polarization, and gridlock, Congress can actually act pretty fast when it is motivated by shame. Although the media didn't take much note of it, both the House and the Senate are quickly moving to put a bill on President Obama's desk which will bring much-needed reforms to the Department of Veterans Affairs. These reforms have, in fact, been necessary for years now, but Congress refused to act. But in the bright light of the recent scandal, Congress acted with blinding speed to enact major reforms to the V.A. system. The vote in the Senate was 93-3 and it passed the House unanimously. Please remember this the next time anyone tells you Congress can't get anything done in a timely fashion. Because when the media effectively turns the spotlight on shameful situations, Congress can act with surprising speed.""
 Hope the steaks were worth it, Eric
This was the most amusing aspect of the Cantor dethroning.
""Eric Cantor's campaign spent almost as much just on steak dinners alone as his opponent spent in total to beat him. There's a lesson in here for fat-cat politicians everywhere: just having a campaign chest full of millions of dollars does not guarantee you an election victory. Eric Cantor spent something like $173 for every vote he got, while his opponent spent less than six bucks per vote. Maybe Cantor should have just bought a steak dinner for every voter in his district -- it probably would have been a cheaper campaign, that way. I sure hope those were tasty steaks, Eric!""
 Tea Party failure
This falls into the category of ""rubbing it in,"" but it's been that kind of week, hasn't it?
""A Tea Partier took down the number two Republican in the House leadership, but in the race to replace him it looks like an Establishment Republican who is to Cantor's left is going to get the job. So the Tea Party got rid of one insufficiently pure leader, but they don't seem to be able to muster the strength to replace him with one of their own. Instead, what they're getting is someone even less pure (by their standard). Not exactly an overwhelming victory for the Tea Party, was it?""
 Obama moves on student loans
While Elizabeth Warren's bill failed, Obama did what he could.
""President Obama introduced new student loan rules which will save money for over five million students. That is an impressive accomplishment, to be sure. But during the same week, the Republicans in the Senate blocked more important reforms to the student loan program, for unfathomable reasons. Obama acted as he did because Republicans won't let Congress move forward on the issue. Voters in families across the country should take note, because it is obvious that Democrats are fighting to reduce the burden of student loans while Republicans are fighting for American students to pay more money in interest to the government. Every mom and dad should remember this when they enter the voting booth this November.""
 So much for being deficit hawks, eh?
This one hasn't gotten nearly the attention it should.
""Republicans in the House voted this week to add tens of billions of dollars to the deficit and to the national debt. Oh, sure, they talk a good line about how they're 'deficit hawks,' but then they turn right around and extend tax breaks without paying for a dime of it. Republicans insist loudly whenever Democrats propose any budget measure that 'it must be paid for!' but the reality is that they are just fine with extending tax breaks without even attempting to pay for it. In other words, Republicans are allowed to do all the deficit spending they want, while Democrats have to pay for every dime of every proposal -- including even emergency aid packages. The stench of hypocrisy was thick over Republican House members this week, and everyone should remember this the next time you hear any Republican crying crocodile tears over the deficit, in the future.""
 Pork is good!
Speaking of the stench of Republican hypocrisy...
""I see that Trent Lott has cut a very interesting ad for Thad Cochran's primary runoff campaign. In it, Lott begs the voters of Mississippi to remember all that wonderful pork-barrel spending that Cochran brings home -- and in which he freely admits that federal spending is a good thing because it equals 'jobs.' After hearing Republicans decrying earmarks and pork and federal spending for years and years, it is simply astounding that Trent Lott -- who is now a powerful lobbyist, I should mention -- thinks that the message to win over voters is: 'more pork!' I mean, do these guys ever listen to themselves?""
 War on genitalia?
Finally, in the ""War On Women"" category, we have a doozy to close with this week.
""I see that conservative radio personality Mark Levin thinks he has the answer to the Republicans' dismal record on women. He confidently advises the Republican Party how they can win elections. Not only is the advice bad, since he is saying 'ignore women voters,' but the way he put it was downright offensive. According to Levin, Republicans should, and I quote, 'stop chasing ethnic groups, stop chasing genitalia.' Wow. Addressing the issues that women voters care about is 'chasing genitalia'? Really? No wonder Republicans have such problems convincing women to vote for them, if this is their attitude.""

133,POLITICS,Mayor Apologizes For Citing WWII Japanese Internment Camps In Rejecting Refugees,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roanoke-mayor-internment-camps_us_564f7128e4b0258edb316857,He said he had no idea his comments would go viral.,2015-11-20,POLITICS,"Roanoke Mayor David Bowers (D) apologized Friday for praising the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, saying he had no idea so many people would notice his statement.
""I apologize to all those offended by my remarks,"" Bowers said at a special meeting of the Roanoke City Council. ""No one else is to be blamed but me.""
Bowers' troubles started Wednesday, when he came out against aiding Syrian refugees in the wake of the Paris attacks. He said all assistance should cease ""until these serious hostilities and atrocities end, or at the very least until regarded as under control by U.S. authorities, and normalcy is restored."" 
""I'm reminded that President Franklin D. Roosevelt felt compelled to sequester Japanese foreign nationals after the bombing of Pearl Harbor,"" he added, ""and it appears that the threat of harm to America from ISIS is now just as real and serious as that from our enemies then.""
Bowers quickly faced national criticism, perhaps most vocally from within his own party. 
Rep. Mike Honda (D-Calif.), who lived in an internment camp, and Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz put out a joint statement saying that ""his rhetoric has no place in our party."" Bowers also lost his spot on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's Virginia Leadership Council. 
In his apology Friday, Bowers said his comments were ""a personal political view"" issued ""in a statement on mayor's office stationery"" and resisted calls for his resignation.
""I anticipated that the statement might receive some coverage in the Roanoke Valley, but I did not in any way anticipate that it would trend internationally over the Internet,"" he said.
""It's just not in my heart to be racist or bigoted,"" he added. ""My statement was intended to be respectful -- was intended to be respectful -- measured and moderate in tone and substance, but it fell short obviously.""
In the wake of the Paris attacks, a growing number of U.S. politicians have called for the United States to impose tighter restrictions -- or close its doors completely -- to refugees fleeing war-torn Syria. Their concerns center around the fear that terrorists could pose as refugees and enter the country, even though none of the Paris attackers have so far been identified as Syrian.

134,POLITICS,Why Barack Obama Should Pick a Republican for Attorney General,"John A. Tures, ContributorPolitical science professor, LaGrange College in Georgia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-republican-attorney-general_b_5888064.html,"Many of the candidates suggested by the media have weaknesses, or other jobs to pursue.  A tough fight is looming, regardless of what happens in 2014.  Obama needs to consider nominating a Republican, with executive experience.",2014-09-26,POLITICS,"The news that longtime Attorney General Eric Holder would resign touched off a lot of speculation about his replacement. Many of the candidates suggested by the media have weaknesses, or other jobs to pursue. A tough fight is looming, regardless of what happens in 2014. Obama needs to consider nominating a Republican, with executive experience.
Solicitor General Donald Verrilli seems to top most pundit lists, but he's not such a great choice. His argument on behalf of Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) was widely panned, even though the ACA was surprisingly upheld as constitutional anyway. For a position most likely to be in the firestorm, he's not the person for the job, even if he's regarded as having a sharp legal mind. That's what advisers are for.
Kamala Harris would be a popular pick, but not a good political one. Most people see Harris as an up-and-comer. The California Attorney General would be a better choice for the Democrats for California Governor in 2018 as Jerry Brown exits the stage (or to oppose a Republican if Brown falters). She would be a smart choice to replace a retiring Dianne Feinstein or Barbara Boxer, both of which entered the U.S. Senate in 1992.
James Cole, the Deputy Attorney General, would be a logical choice to step in for his former boss. But Cole was the subject of a brutal confirmation hearing. Republicans blocked a vote on his confirmation, and he was in judicial limbo for a long time while the Senate battled over whether he should get a hearing. Even when he slipped through, it was later revealed that he was the one who authorized the subpoena to get the Associated Press phone records. That's sure to make any nomination hearings pretty messy.
Labor Secretary Thomas Perez is likely to be on the short list, since he already served in the Justice Department back in the 1990s. But that would require two tough confirmation hearings for two open cabinet positions. It could be even tougher if the process drags into 2015, when the GOP is sure to be a lot stronger.
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse used to be Rhode Island's Attorney General. And he's already well-known among his colleagues. But his absence would open up a seat for a Democratic Party having to defend way too many seats, thanks to Senate retirements. Even in a safe blue state like Rhode Island, that's more money and effort the party doesn't have for a special election in 2014 or early 2015.
Kathryn Ruemmler would be a good choice. She was the White House Counsel and former Justice Department official, who helped prosecute the Enron executives. But she's not as well known. Besides, serving as Obama's lawyer can be tough, especially with cases like the president's actions in the IRS affair. 
But picking a Republican makes a lot more sense. And Barack Obama's choice should be former Vermont Governor Jim Douglas. Douglas served from 2003 through 2011. Despite being the chief executive of a blue state, his popularity ratings were sky high. And he's got a good working relationship with Obama, being the first governor (Democrat or Republican) to meet with the president. And Douglas also chaired the National Governor's Association during a successful time for the GOP, between 2009 and 2010.
Obama has already appointed Republicans to his cabinet (Ray LaHood, John McHugh, Robert Gates). This would give him a candidate who would be easily confirmed, and send the signal that the president still wants to work with the GOP for his last two years, putting someone in charge of the Justice Department with executive experience.

135,POLITICS,House Republicans Weigh A Do-Nothing Agenda For 2018,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-do-nothing-agenda_us_5aa06fb3e4b0d4f5b66d34ef,Are GOP lawmakers trying to run out the clock on themselves?,2018-03-08,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― Some Republican lawmakers are beginning to ask whether their leaders plan to be ambitious enough with what could be the final months of united GOP control of the government.
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) presented a slide at a GOP conference meeting Tuesday that showed an admittedly incomplete but still rather sparse agenda for the coming months, according to members at the gathering.
Although that agenda included an omnibus appropriations bill to keep the government funded until October, as well as a Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization and some banking legislation, other items were pure messaging votes ― like a balanced budget amendment and implausible Internal Revenue Service reforms tied to April 15.
Also on the slide was the so-called Stop School Violence Act, the most ambitious feature of which is the name. The bill would simply provide $50 million annually for training and equipment to prevent and respond to school violence. Plus, there was mention of legislation to streamline permits for energy infrastructure projects and the farm bill, which may come down to a one-year extension rather than a full five-year reauthorization. 
What was more notable about the Republican House agenda was what wasn’t included. There was no major infrastructure legislation. No bill addressing the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program. No budget. No real legislation on guns. Even the individual appropriations bills weren’t on the list.
When McCarthy received pushback during the conference meeting on Tuesday, he noted it wasn’t an exhaustive list. Republicans will surely pass other bills in addition to what was mentioned. For example, Congress has to pass some sort of spending bill to keep the government open beyond September (after passing the omnibus to keep the government open past the end of March).
McCarthy spokesman Matt Sparks told HuffPost on Wednesday that “House Republicans continue to advance our agenda, building on the positive momentum from 2017 to strengthen our communities, military, and economy.”
Voting And Chewing Gum At The Same Time
It’s unclear, however, what else Republicans actually intend to get signed into law before the midterm elections, which could hand Democrats control of one or both chambers of Congress. There is a banking bill currently in the Senate that could eventually get to the president’s desk, there are some financial regulations that Republicans have their eyes on, and there are plenty of seemingly small changes to law that could have dramatic consequences for people in the future.
The Senate, for instance, could devote much of its time to confirming judges and reshape the federal judiciary for decades to come. And the Trump administration could singlehandedly dismantle a number of regulations that Democrats favor.
But that doesn’t seem to be enough for many House conservatives.
“The American people expect more than an omnibus and a few bills that do not really address key concerns,” Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost on Tuesday, specifically mentioning infrastructure as an area of needed action.
Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) also criticized his party’s leadership for a less-than-aggressive agenda, although he noted that he didn’t think it was any different from how Republicans have run Congress for the entirety of his seven-plus years here.
“That’s the way they run the place,” Amash said. “It’s a shame. I don’t know what to tell you. I wouldn’t run it this way.”
Asked what he intended to do about it, Amash didn’t really have an answer. “Unless someone wants to organize a coup, I’m not sure there’s much you can do,” he said, adding that he had no plans to try to oust Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) “in the immediate future.”
“You never can rule it out though,” Amash added.
Other Republicans were also happy to say the GOP needed to do more with the time left before the November elections. Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) said he wanted Republicans to tackle mandatory spending issues. Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.) said it’d be a shame not to approve a budget so that Republicans could use that as a reconciliation vehicle to pass legislation ― perhaps on “welfare reform” ― with a simple majority in the Senate. And yet another Florida Republican, freshman Rep. Matt Gaetz, said he had thus far been disappointed by Congress’ inability to “walk and chew gum at the same time.”
Playing The Long Game, Fingers Crossed
But some Republicans are already nervous about their re-election bids, and GOP leaders seem content so far to let their members run on last year’s tax law, while not muddling the message by overreaching on something like welfare reform.
GOP leaders are so resistant to pushing aggressive welfare changes that more conservative House members are advocating for a tactical retreat on the farm bill, which would be a natural vehicle for enacting those changes, because they don’t believe they can get the policies they want now. Conservatives would like to extend the farm bill for just one year, saving the fight and the vehicle for a later day.
That sentiment among Republican lawmakers ― that they can’t get what they want now, so they might as well delay on the chance that they can get what they want later ― could dominate the rest of the year.
Even basic responsibilities could be pushed off, like passing individual appropriations bills or a budget. Last year, Republicans in the House just bundled together the spending measures and restricted which amendments could get a vote, while the Senate didn’t do any individual appropriations bills. Lawmakers could follow a similar script this year, leaving plenty of time for campaigning, more messaging legislation and additional bills renaming post offices ― a category that has already inflated the number of bills passed and signed into law under President Donald Trump.
Still, there were Republicans who insisted that Congress was as busy as ever.
Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) told HuffPost that Republicans were taking the agenda for the rest of the year “very seriously, and we intend to address some very serious issues.”
Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) argued that the problem wasn’t with House Republicans.
“It seems like the House is doing a hell of a lot,” Buck said. “Why don’t you talk to the Senate?”
He said that hundreds of bills had passed the House and were waiting for action in the Senate. And when HuffPost noted that many of those just renamed things, Buck defended the virtue of smaller bills.
“Some are more important than that,” he said. “I just had one that passed by voice vote that fixes a problem in the civil service system.”

Robert Bentley (R) pointed to one of man’s greatest scientific achievements as evidence that his state could build more prisons.
Noting that 2019 would mark the 50th anniversary of his state putting a man on the moon, Bentley argued that Alabama should be able to build more facilities.
“If Alabamians can put man on the moon, we can build new prisons,” Bentley said during his State of the State address on Tuesday. The Saturn V rocket, which propelled Apollo 11 to the moon in 1969, was built at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.
Bentley is seeking to borrow $800 million to build four new state prisons, according to AL.com. The money would pay for four new prisons ― three for men and one for women ― while 13 of the state’s 15 men’s facilities would close.
Alabama has severe overcrowding in its prisons. Last year, PBS reported that the system was holding over 24,000 prisoners ― nearly double the number it was designed for.
In October, the Department of Justice opened an investigation into conditions in Alabama’s prisons. The investigation looks at whether prisoners are protected from harm and sexual abuse from both staff and other prisoners.

137,POLITICS,Paul Ryan On 2016: 'Count Me Out',Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-president-2016_us_570d4138e4b0885fb50e7179,But don't count out a contested convention.,2016-04-12,POLITICS,"About 15 months ago, in January 2015, Paul Ryan announced he wouldn’t seek the presidency in 2016. On Tuesday, he said it again, using his strongest phrase to date: “I do not want, nor will I accept, the nomination for our party.”
It was nearly the ""Shermanesque"" pledge many expected. The infamous words -- ""I will not accept if nominated and will not serve if elected"" -- first uttered by Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman during the presidential election of 1884, have become the standard for anyone genuinely not interested in a particular office. And while Ryan didn't perfectly repeat the pledge, his vow that he wouldn't accept the nomination is likely strong enough to end the speculation. 
""If no candidate has a majority on the first ballot, I believe that you should only choose from a person who has actually participated in the primary,” Ryan said. “Count me out.”
“I simply believe that if you want to be the nominee for our party, to be the president, you should actually run for it,"" he said. ""I chose not to do this, therefore, I should not be considered. Period. End of story.”
But the Wisconsin Republican was less definitive on what will happen in July during the GOP convention. The speaker, who is chairman of the convention, seemed to accept that a contested convention was a real possibility, and that the nomination wouldn't just be handed over to the person who is closest to a majority of delegates.
Ryan even suggested that delegates create a rule that only allows someone who ran for the presidency to take the nomination.
""The rules committee, which is assembled by the delegates, will decide what the rules are, but I would encourage the delegates to put in place a rule that says you can only nominate someone who actually ran for the job,” he said.
There has been an increasing swirl of speculation that Ryan could become the GOP nominee if no candidate can reach the majority threshold of delegates on a first ballot. And even with Ryan's regular reminders that he isn't running for president, many have noted that Ryan is the speaker now even though he said repeatedly that he had no interest in the position.
On Tuesday, though, Ryan called that comparison ""apples and oranges.""
""Being speaker of the House is a far cry from being president of the United States,"" Ryan said.
""That is entirely different than getting the nomination for president of the United States by your party without even running for the job,"" he said.

138,POLITICS,Afghanistan: The Gateway Drug For Three Administrations,"Tom Engelhardt, ContributorEditor, TomDispatch.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/afghanistan-the-gateway-drug-for-three-administrations_us_5a091767e4b05673aa5a2d60,"Cross-posted with TomDispatch.com As you read “Into the Afghan Abyss (Again)” by historian Alfred McCoy, author most recently",2017-11-13,POLITICS,"Cross-posted with TomDispatch.com
As you read “Into the Afghan Abyss (Again)” by historian Alfred McCoy, author most recently of In the Shadows of the American Century: The Rise and Decline of U.S. Global Power, think of Afghanistan as the gateway drug for three Washington administrations. Within weeks of the 9/11 attacks, George W. Bush and his top officials had launched their invasion of that country and soon knocked off the Taliban (rather than simply going after Osama bin Laden and his followers). That “victory,” however ephemeral, acted as the policy equivalent of a drug high for the president and his crew of geopolitical dreamers who promptly turned their attention to Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and nailing down the rest of the oil heartlands of the planet. (And you know just how well that went in mission-accomplished terms.) 
In 2009-2010, Afghanistan (“the right war”) would prove the gateway drug for Barack Obama as he surged in 30,000 troops, along with mini-surges of contractors, CIA agents, Special Forces soldiers, and others. Before he was done, from Libya to Iraq, the Afghan War would be the least of his problems. 
And finally, of course, there’s Donald Trump, who, in the years leading up to his election victory, spoke or tweeted as if he might take a different approach to Afghanistan, but then surrounded himself with three generals from America’s losing wars and once again decided to do the usual Afghan thing. Now, he, too, is hooked and, from Niger to Somalia and beyond, the results are already coming in. 
Though seldom thought of that way (except perhaps by McCoy), Afghanistan is not just the longest war in American history but possibly the longest opium war in anyone’s history. And sixteen years later, here’s one thing we can take for granted about what’s likely to happen: in the end, it never goes well. If we know less than we should about how badly it’s going right now, part of that can be explained by the policies of those most deeply hooked on the war. When things go badly for them, they turn off the information spigot, as in 2015 when the American command in Afghanistan cut off all public release of material on “U.S.-taxpayer-funded efforts to build, train, equip, and sustain the Afghan National Security Forces.” That was, of course, at the point when almost $65 billion had already been poured into training and equipping those forces and they were failing nationwide. 
Since then, we know that Afghan police and military casualties have soared, desertions have risen, “ghost soldiers” fill many units (with their commanders and others skimming off their salaries), and the Taliban has gained control of ever more of the country. In response, the U.S. command there has again “classified and restricted once-public information regarding the state of Afghan security forces, including ‘casualties, personnel strength, attrition, capability assessments, and operational readiness of equipment.’”
And so it goes in America’s drug war in South Asia. Someday, the high will truly wear off and then who knows where we’ll be. In the meantime, read McCoy and think about what this repetitive version of war making means so many years later.

139,POLITICS,Friday Talking Points -- Marijuana Policy Questions for the Candidates,"Chris Weigant, ContributorPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/friday-talking-points_b_9647978.html,"There was some good news and some bad news on marijuana this week, which got us thinking about how the subject of federal marijuana policy relates to the presidential nomination race.",2016-04-09,POLITICS,"There was some good news and some bad news on marijuana this week, which got us thinking about how the subject of federal marijuana policy relates to the presidential nomination race. So while we'll take care of the news (good and bad) in the awards section, we're going to also devote the talking points section to a list of questions we would love to hear answered by all the candidates. Obviously, the answers from Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are the most important, since they'd be the only ones who might actually try to improve the current situation, but it really shouldn't excuse the Republicans from having to answer them as well. Rather than just a quick ""Do you support medical marijuana?"" question, we really think the issue needs to be addressed in a little more depth.
In non-marijuana news, the presidential campaign just keeps chugging along. This week was a good one for the underdogs, as both Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz won big in the Wisconsin primaries. Of course, this sent all the political pundits into a tizzy, all but declaring Donald Trump's campaign dead in the water. They seemed to collectively forget that the next big state to vote is New York, where Trump will quite likely crush the competition (Ted Cruz is already regretting that ""New York values"" dig he made toward Trump in an earlier debate). But until then, expect lots and lots of rampant speculation about an open Republican convention. Earlier this week, Salon pointed out that things could get quite ugly if the GOP does manage to wrest the nomination away from Trump (which led me to write about how the ""days of rage"" might actually come to pass). Short answer: Trump followers aren't just going to quietly accept Paul Ryan as the nominee. Far from it.
On the Democratic side of things, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are getting a little more feisty in how they're referring to each other. The media is trying to turn this into some sort of ""open warfare,"" but what is really happening is they are both vying for New York voters. New Yorkers are a pretty brash and outspoken lot, so all we see is the candidates using rhetoric the crowd wants to hear, really. The New York contest is an interesting one because both Democrats can claim ""home state"" status here -- Bernie was born in New York City, and Hillary was the state's senator for eight years. Hillary has already won the other two states she can claim (Illinois and Arkansas) and Bernie won Vermont, so now New York will get to vote for either a ""favorite son"" or a ""favorite daughter."" So far, Hillary has the polling lead, but that could change after next week's debate, so stay tuned!
Hillary tried to stage a photo op to tease Bernie about not knowing how to ride the subway in New York City (Bernie's ""you buy a token"" was a wee bit out of date), but she kind of blew it when she obviously didn't know how to use the farecard herself. This led to an amusing dig at Hillary from none other than Michele Bachmann.
The other embarrassing news for Hillary this week came from her husband. Bill was interrupted by Black Lives Matter protesters at a campaign event, and he tried to argue them into submission. This didn't work out as well as he might have planned, however. Bill tried to defend his own record as president, which is obviously personal to him, but in doing so he sounded rather dismissive of the opinions he was disagreeing with. This is not exactly helpful to Hillary right now, since any drop in African-American support for her could be disastrous in the next states to hold primaries. We'll have to wait and see just how big an impact Bill's back-and-forth with Black Lives Matter winds up having.
And finally, in the most appropriate inadvertent acronym since George Bush wanted to call his invasion ""Operation Iraq Liberation,"" George Mason University announced last week that it was going to change the name of its law school to the ""Antonin Scalia School Of Law."" Because ASSOL (or even ASSLAW) is the perfect way to remember Scalia!
Bernie Sanders deserves at least an Honorable Mention for chalking up an impressive 14 percent victory over Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin on Tuesday night, which was a much larger margin than anyone was predicting. This continues a winning streak for Bernie, and (importantly, for him) this was the first primary (as opposed to caucus) that Bernie won in that streak. He's now won seven of the last eight contests (six states plus Democrats Abroad), and if he wins again tomorrow night in Wyoming, this will improve to eight out of nine.
[Program Note: For those playing along with our ""predict the primaries"" series of columns, this counts as my prediction: Bernie will indeed handily win the Wyoming caucuses tomorrow night.]
At the end of the week, Bernie announced he'd be taking a day off the campaign trail to accept an invitation to address the Vatican on income inequality, also a favorite subject of Pope Francis. That's a pretty impressive way to cap off a pretty good week, we have to admit.
But this week the Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week award goes to eight Democrats in the Senate who sent a letter to the Drug Enforcement Agency posing some rather important questions about federal marijuana policy. These senators are: Elizabeth Warren, Jeff Merkley, Ron Wyden, Barbara Mikulski, Ed Markey, Barbara Boxer, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand. All of them (except Warren) are also co-sponsors of a bill introduced last year ""designed to drastically reduce the federal government's ability to crack down on state-legal medical marijuana programs while also encouraging more research into the substance.""
This effort was in the news because the D.E.A. finally responded in a 25-page letter of their own. The D.E.A. revealed that they were going to try (there were some weasel words used) to complete a review of the possibility of rescheduling marijuana on the federal list of controlled substances ""in the first half of 2016."" This means the law could change as early as this summer. They also revealed that they have already received a recommendation from the F.D.A. on the matter, but they did not reveal what it said.
This is the key issue in ending the federal War On Weed (which I explained in detail yesterday, if anyone's interested). Take out this one stumbling block, and the rest of federal marijuana policy can start to change to a realistic and sane approach, in other words. So it's a big deal.
For a long time, the D.E.A. under the Obama administration refused to face the new reality of states legalizing both medical and recreational marijuana. Finally, to the vast relief of drug policy advocates everywhere, last year Michele Leonhart stepped down from leading the agency. The decision on rescheduling marijuana simply would not have been possible under Leonhart, but there is hope with new leadership that the agency will finally move beyond the worst attitudes of the War On Drugs and start to help craft a new federal legal policy. It's too early to celebrate -- in their letter, the D.E.A. gave absolutely no hint which way it is going to act.
But for spurring this process along, and for writing legislation to end some of the worst excesses from the past, we have to award the Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week to the eight senators who are showing real leadership on the issue.
[Congratulate Senator Cory Booker on his Senate contact page, Senator Barbara Boxer on her Senate contact page, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand on her Senate contact page, Senator Edward Markey on his Senate contact page, Senator Jeff Merkley on his Senate contact page, Senator Barbara Mikulski on her Senate contact page, Senator Elizabeth Warren on her Senate contact page, and Senator Ron Wyden on his Senate contact page, to let them all know you appreciate their efforts.]
There was a Senate hearing on marijuana this week. It was a complete sham -- one of those hearings where only one viewpoint is even allowed in the room, where all the witnesses are selected so they can echo back the opinions the senators already hold. In this case, the opinion (as espoused by Jeff Sessions): ""that good people don't smoke marijuana.""
The four witnesses called were: a critic of the Obama marijuana policy, a prosecutor ""who led raids on pot farms in California,"" a state attorney general who had sued Colorado over legalization, and a board member of an organization dedicated to stopping the legalization movement. Pretty fair and balanced, eh?
Michael Collins of the Drug Policy Alliance doesn't think so, and doesn't mince words:
These hearings are a one-sided sham with the deck stacked with witnesses who have a track record of vehemently opposing marijuana legalization. An honest evaluation of marijuana legalization would include the undeniable benefits of legalization, like the massive drop in marijuana arrests, the billions in taxes, and the transition from an underground market to a regulated one.
But, of course, the senators weren't after any sort of honest evaluation -- they just wanted to hear the ""Drugs are bad... mmm'kay?"" refrain that has been soothing them since the 1980s. Sessions even spoke favorably about Nancy Reagan's ""Just Say No"" campaign, to provide a nostalgic glow.
However, we expect this sort of thing from Republicans. They've been making political hay over the Drug War (and over law-and-order issues generally) for decades now. People like Chuck Grassley, who co-chairs the committee, are probably never going to change. They're permanently stuck in the past, where if we just throw another few million people in jail, the problem will be solved!
What we find massively disappointing, though, is to see one of California's own senators enthusiastically joining in. Because Grassley's co-chair is none other than Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is described as being one of ""the Senate's most strident anti-drug crusaders,"" along with Grassley.
DiFi has long been anti-weed. She actually led the effort against the previous legalization ballot measure in her state (Proposition 19, which failed back in 2010). If, as expected, Californians get another chance to vote on legalizing recreational marijuana this year, it wouldn't surprise us in the least to see ""vote no"" ads featuring DiFi.
Feinstein is fighting a losing battle. History is moving in the exact opposite direction she is heading, in fact. Feinstein and her Republican buddies want to take America backwards, and return to an era of complete denial of reality. For enthusiastically participating in such a sham hearing, and for refusing to allow any witnesses who might have held a different opinion from her own, Dianne Feinstein is our Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week this week.
[Contact Senator Dianne Feinstein on her Senate contact page, to let her know what you think of her actions.]
Volume 386 (4/8/16)
If the Drug Enforcement Agency does follow through and issue a decision on rescheduling marijuana by summertime, it almost guarantees it will become a hot topic in the presidential race. Whether the D.E.A. decides to reschedule or not, the incoming president is going to have a big influence on federal marijuana policy for the next four years.
But by summer, we should have a Democratic nominee. So it'll be too late for the issue to mean anything in the nomination race currently underway. So instead of talking points this week designed for Democrats to raise issues effectively, we are going to ask seven questions that we would sincerely like to hear both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton answer. Whenever the subject arises in a question to a candidate, it is often either posed or answered in very general terms (""Do you support legalization?"" for instance). We think this is a shame, because there are nuances and technical legalisms that really bear closer examination. If the next president is going to lead on the issue (rather than reluctantly follow the will of the people), they should really have thought about these things, and have answers for what they would do as president. So here are our questions for both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders to answer.
 What would your administration policy be?
First, a generic question. Depending on the answer to this, some of the other questions may not be necessary.
""By the time you are sworn into office, over 10 states may have legalized recreational use of marijuana for all their adult citizens. However, federal law supercedes all of these new state laws. So far, the Obama administration has taken a somewhat hands-off attitude, but that could change under a new administration. So how would you deal with the new reality of perhaps one-fifth of the United States allowing legal recreational marijuana? As president, how exactly would you change federal law and Justice Department policy?""
 Reschedule?
The next two questions are really the most important, because they'd have the greatest effect on overall policy.
""Currently, marijuana is listed as a Schedule I controlled substance. This classification means the federal government believes that marijuana is more dangerous than cocaine, PCP, crystal meth, and opium. Richard Nixon's administration made this classification, and it has never changed since. If the D.E.A. refuses to reschedule marijuana this summer, would you guarantee that you would do so as president? Which schedule would you move it to? Schedule II? Schedule III? Or even lower?""
 Or deschedule?
The commonsense solution needs to be asked about, as well.
""There is already a federal bureau which has the responsibility of overseeing alcohol and tobacco. Wouldn't it make more sense to completely deschedule marijuana and hand off oversight of marijuana issues to the A.T.F.? Especially considering that the number of states where recreational marijuana is fully legal can only be expected to grow, over time?""
 Freedom to travel
Prohibition didn't completely end, but local bans can only go so far.
""When Prohibition ended, some states and counties refused to condone the sale of alcohol. There are still many of these 'dry' counties left, in fact. But a key point is that while it may be illegal to buy alcohol in any given county, it cannot be illegal there to possess or even consume alcohol (in the privacy of one's own home). A person can legally drive through a 'dry' county with a sixpack of beer in the car, and if they stopped at a hotel there they could legally drink that alcohol in their room. Would you support changing federal law so that no state can criminalize either simple possession or private use of marijuana, so that it would be treated the same way that alcohol is now treated under the law?""
 Free the doctors!
Don't let candidates get away with just a generic ""I support more research"" answer, here.
""Currently, anyone applying to conduct marijuana research has to jump through all kinds of legal hoops that other medical researchers do not have to, which wastes an enormous amount of time and effort. Would you support removing all unreasonable barriers to medical marijuana research that still exist? Would you support changing the application process for doctors wanted to conduct research so that it is the same process as for any other drug undergoing study?""
 Free the accountants!
This is only going to become a bigger and bigger issue, as more states legalize marijuana.
""Marijuana businesses that are fully in compliance with their state's laws still cannot use banking services that any other business is able to. Bankers are afraid they'll be charged as accessories to drug trafficking, so they refuse to do business with marijuana companies. Would you support changing federal law so that it is clear that banks will not have to worry about criminal charges for conducting business with marijuana companies that follow state law? Also, would you support changing federal tax law so that marijuana businesses could deduct the common business expenses that every other business is allowed to write off on their taxes?""
 Free the prisoners!
Obama got this ball rolling, but a lot more needs to be done.
""President Obama has been pardoning or commuting long jail terms for people sentenced under the worst of the War On Drugs 'lock them all up' laws. Would you continue these amnesty efforts, to give relief to prisoners who are serving sentences that they likely would not receive today?""

140,POLITICS,How US Policy Helps Al Qaeda In Yemen,"Jonathan Marshall, ContributorIndependent scholar and journalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-us-policy-helps-al-qaeda-in-yemen_us_59838538e4b0bd823202964f,There’s only one way to dry up its support: The international community must demand a cease-fire.,2017-08-03,POLITICS,"In a world of bad actors, one of the “baddest” of all is the Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which the CIA once branded “the most dangerous regional node in the global jihad.” It masterminded the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000; nearly blew up a U.S. passenger jet flying into Detroit on Christmas Day, 2009; brought down a UPS cargo plane in 2010; and sponsored the 2015 attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris, killing 11 and wounding another 11.
All of which raises an embarrassing question: Why is the United States supporting AQAP’s main ally in Yemen, Saudi Arabia?
The respected news publication Middle East Eye reports that Abdulmajid al-Zindani, a Yemeni cleric, “veteran al-Qaeda supporter,” and “former spiritual adviser to Osama bin Laden,” has been operating freely in Saudi Arabia, even posting YouTube videos lauding the Saudi war in his home country.
Apparently no one in Riyadh cares that he’s been on the U.S. Treasury’s Specially Designated Global Terrorist List since 2004, identified as a recruiter for terrorist training camps and a key purchaser of weapons for al-Qaeda and other extremist groups. Indeed, Zindani “has been warmly received by senior clerics and officials,” including one adviser to the Royal Court, according to Middle East Eye.
The publication’s sources further allege that “at least five Yemenis designated as terrorists by the U.S. Treasury have advised and coordinated Saudi operations in Yemen with allied forces on the ground.” One senior al-Qaeda supporter in Yemen, Nayif al-Qaysi, has been repeatedly interviewed in Saudi Arabia by fawning television stations. He served as governor of the Yemeni city of Bayda until late July.
Most bizarre of all, one notorious al-Qaeda fundraiser, who has lived in Saudi Arabia for nearly three years, turned up on a list of terrorists whom Saudi Arabia accused Qatar of harboring. Saudi Arabia and four other Arab states broke diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar in early June, in part over allegations that Doha supports extremists.
The Devastation of Yemen
Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and other Arab allies have been laying waste to Yemen with logistic support from the United States. They are fighting to wrest control of the country from Houthi militants and their ally, former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Riyadh aims to reinstate Saleh’s rival, President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, whose legal mandate ended in January 2015.
Tens of thousands of Yemenis have died from the fighting, historic cities have been pulverized by criminal Saudi bombing raids, and more than 400,000 people have contracted deadly cholera. Almost two million children and millions more adults suffer from malnutrition owing to war-related disruptions of food supplies and a Saudi blockade of Yemen’s ports.
Suffering and chaos provide ideal breeding grounds for AQAP, which took control of a provincial capital and one of Yemen’s largest ports for many months. A special report last year by Reuters concluded that
 the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen, . . . backed by the United States, has helped Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to become stronger than at any time since it first emerged almost 20 years ago. 
Even the UAE newspaper The National conceded last month:
 In the absence of a political resolution that addresses local grievances and builds and empowers a central state that can provide jobs and services, Al Qaeda has filled vacuums and its fighters have found a role, while a sectarian narrative that is promoted by the group has increasing traction. 
This matters not only because of AQAP’s potential threat to U.S. security, but because the only possible legal rationale for continued U.S. military involvement in Yemen is the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists, which approves operations against al-Qaeda, not in support of its allies. Members of Congress are growing restive about such legal issues as U.S. tax dollars fund the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen, with no end in sight.
Getting Stronger
AQAP has gained traction by taking advantage of growing local resentment toward U.S. and UAE counterterrorism operations that result in the murder or torture of suspects.
In a weird twist, typical of the war’s endlessly shifting alliances, AQAP has also joined pro-Saudi forces in bloody offensives to retake the southern city of Taiz from Houthi rebels.
“We fight along all Muslims in Yemen, together with different Islamic groups,” against the Houthis, said Qasim al-Rimi, the senior military commander of AQAP, this spring.
Although the United States put a $5 million price on al-Rimi’s head, Associated Press reported that his forces “regularly receive funds and weapons from the U.S.-backed Saudi led coalition.”
Ironically, just hours before U.S. commandos killed another prominent AQAP-linked tribal leader in late January (along with several children), that leader had arranged for the Saudi-backed coalition of President Hadi to pay his tribal fighters $60,000 to join in the fight against Houthi rebels.
No wonder the International Crisis Group recently reported that “The Yemeni branch of al-Qaeda is stronger than it has ever been,” and that AQAP “is thriving in an environment of state collapse, growing sectarianism, shifting alliances, security vacuums and a burgeoning war economy.” AQAP, it added, has “emerged arguably as the biggest winners of the failed political transition and civil war that followed.”
Targeting Islamist tribal leaders with more bombs, drones, and military raids — as the Trump administration seems inclined to do — will simply aggravate civilian suffering and strengthen AQAP’s political base. There’s only one way to dry up its support: The international community must demand a cease-fire, send foreign armies packing, promote a political settlement among all Yemeni stakeholders, and supply food and medical aid to alleviate the population’s extraordinary suffering.

141,POLITICS,"In An Award Show That Was So Much About Politics, Donald Trump Barely Came Up",Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-golden-globes_us_5a538a2ae4b0efe47ebb01ba,"At the Golden Globes, it was striking that the president was mostly a nonentity — unlike during last year’s ceremony, when he loomed large.",2018-01-08,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― Sunday night’s Golden Globe Awards was bound to feature political moments, with attendees turning the spotlight to sexual harassment and gender inequality in the workplace, both in society at large and within their own industry.
The theme prevailed throughout the night, both on the red carpet and during the ceremony itself, though with mixed results. 
Many Hollywood icons in attendance had previously not missed a chance to make pointed political remarks. One of the night’s nominated movies, “The Post,” was produced as a direct response to the president of the United States. So it was striking that Donald Trump was mostly a nonentity — unlike during last year’s Globes, when, on the eve of his inauguration, the president-elect loomed large.
That night, Meryl Streep memorably turned her speech accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award, the Globes’ equivalent of a lifetime achievement award, into a searing critique of Trump, which drew a response from him the following morning. Calls for diversity and inclusion and other references to Trump’s divisiveness came up during other winners’ speeches.
Fast forward one year, and Trump barely came up during Sunday’s ceremony — even though in so many ways, the #MeToo movement includes the president, who has been accused of sexual harassment or assault by more than a dozen women, bragged on tape about groping women, and unleashed a cascade of sexist and misogynistic attacks against his female opponent during the 2016 election. His victory inspired a groundswell activism by women, fueled by their rage.
Yet on Sunday, there were just a sprinkling of moments that seemed to pertain to the president, such as pledges to support the free press. 
“We know the press is under siege these days,” Oprah Winfrey, this year’s Cecil B. DeMille honoree, said in her speech. “We also know it’s the insatiable dedication to uncovering the absolute truth that keeps us from turning a blind eye to corruption and to injustice, to tyrants and victims, and secrets and lies. I value the press more than ever before.”
Meher Tatna, the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), announced that the group would donate $1 million each to the Committee to Protect Journalists and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
Thanking the HFPA while accepting her award for Best Actress in a Drama, Frances McDormand quipped, “Let’s face it, they managed to elect a female president. I’m just saying.”
The most direct references to Trump came during host Seth Meyers’ opening monologue.
Meyers recalled how instead of Trump, actor Seth Rogen used to be “the guy making trouble with North Korea,” referring to the regime objecting to Rogen’s controversial 2014 movie “The Interview.” 
“Simpler times,” Meyers said wistfully.
“Give it up for the Hollywood Foreign Press, a string of three words that could not have been better designed to infuriate our president,” Meyers continued, similar to a comment Streep made last year. “The only name that would make him angrier would be the Hillary Mexico Salad Association.”
Meyers also looked back on his infamous roast of Trump at the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Dinner, which the then-reality television star attended while promoting his unfounded conspiracy that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.
“In 2011, I told some jokes about our current president at the White House Correspondents Dinner, jokes about how he was unqualified to be president. Some have said that night convinced him to run,” he said. 
Turning to Winfrey, Meyers continued: “So if that’s true, I just want to say: Oprah, you will never be president! You do not have what it takes!”
He then told Tom Hanks that he would “never be vice president,” joking that the everyman actor is “too mean and unrelatable.”
“Now we just wait and see,” Meyers said.
Coincidentally, Winfrey’s rousing speech later in the night drew speculation that she could indeed run for president in 2020.
But others pushed back, noting that the lesson of the Trump era may not be to encourage a celebrity to launch a political career.

143,POLITICS,Melania Trump: Adults Should 'Take The Lead' In Encouraging Positive Social Media Habits,Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/melania-trump-social-media_us_5a94496ae4b0699553cb0048,"Meanwhile, her husband is arguably the highest-profile cyberbully of all time.",2018-02-26,POLITICS,"First lady Melania Trump, whose husband routinely attacks and insults people online, said Monday that adults should “take the lead” in helping children develop positive social media habits.
The first lady discussed the need for children to have a healthier relationship with technology while speaking at a White House luncheon for spouses of governors. 
″It is important that as adults we take the lead and the responsibility in helping our children manage the many issues they are facing today,” Trump said. “This means encouraging positive habits with social media and technology, even limiting time online and understand the content they are exposed to on a daily basis.”
Trump vowed in November 2016 to make cyberbullying one of her top priorities if her husband, Donald, was elected to the presidency. She has yet to take significant steps to combat the issue.
Meanwhile, the president continues to bully his critics and spread misinformation via Twitter, where he has 48 million followers. Earlier this month, he tweeted that media icon Oprah Winfrey was “very insecure,” and has repeatedly tried to humiliate MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski by calling her “dumb as a rock” and accusing her of undergoing plastic surgery.
Last Friday, Lauren Hogg, a 14-year-old survivor of the deadly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, pleaded with the first lady to stop her stepson Donald Trump Jr. from “cyberbullying” her family.
Trump Jr., the president’s eldest son, had “liked” two tweets promoting a conspiracy theory about Lauren’s 17-year-old brother, David Hogg, another Parkland survivor. The conspiracy theory claims that David has been coached to speak out against guns by his father, a retired FBI agent, in order to somehow deflect blame from the FBI for not preventing the shooting.
A representative for Melania Trump did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

Susan Russell, ContributorEpiscopal priest and activist from Pasadena, Calif.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baptism-baby-jack-and-the-bishop-of-central-flordia_b_7235248.html,"If you missed the memo, there's a very sad situation down in the Diocese of Central Florida wherein Baby Jack was denied the sacrament of baptism because Baby Jack happened to have two dads.",2015-05-07,RELIGION,"If you missed the memo, there's a very sad situation down in the Episcopal Diocese of Central Florida wherein Baby Jack was denied the sacrament of baptism because Baby Jack happened to have two dads. Their story is here ... and I was deeply moved by the way Jack's dad Rich opened his account: ""My hope in sharing our story is to raise awareness to our community, and to offer perspective to a reticent institution.""
He has accomplished both.
The Faithful America online petition that had a goal of 15,000 signatures is up to nearly 24,000 as I write. Clearly awareness has been raised in the community that no matter how optimistic we are about the Supreme Court and the movement toward marriage equality, the battle against homophobia is far from won.
And he has also gotten the attention of ""a reticent institution."" Barraged by emails, Facebook comments and secular media attention, Central Florida Bishop Greg Brewer is meeting with the family today -- Thursday, May 7 -- because, according to the Orlando Sentinel: ""Whether they are active in the church and Christians in the community is far more important than whether they are gay or straight.""
So my expectation would be that from now on Bishop Brewer will be meeting personally with each and every baptismal family in the Diocese of Central Florida to discern whether or not the parents are active in the church and Christians in the community. Otherwise he will be guilty in 2015 of singling out LGBT parents seeking the sacrament of baptism for their children for the same kind of heightened scrutiny African American voters were subjected to when seeking the constitutional right to vote before the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That kind of systemic bigotry had no place in our nation fifty years ago and it has no place in our church today. 
And so the only thing that Bishop Brewer should say to Jack's parents today is how profoundly sorry he is for the fact that he failed as the chief pastor and shepherd of the flock in his diocese to protect his LGBT sheep from the assault of systemic homophobia that raised its ugly head and disrupted their plans to baptize their child into the Body of Christ. 
I remain ever hopeful that this sad episode can be used by the Holy Spirit for the good of breaking down any barriers between the full inclusion of LGBT people in the work and witness of the Diocese of Central Florida. It certainly has the potential to be a Syrophoenician Woman Moment -- reminiscent of the story from Matthew's gospel where Jesus himself changed his mind about healing the daughter of the woman his tradition and his disciples told him was unworthy. 
WWJD? He'd baptize Jack, of course. Let's fix this, people. And not just for Jack -- but for all the babies coming after him. We not only can do better than this -- we have to.

145,RELIGION,Race Is At The Heart Of The New Faith-Driven Environmental Justice,"Ilgin Yorulmaz, ContributorFreelance Turkish Journalist, East West Center Fellow",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/race-is-at-the-heart-of-the-new-faith-driven-environmental_us_5934c038e4b0649fff211abf,Ilgin Beygo Yorulmaz is a reporter for Auburn Voices ― a media platform by Auburn Seminary for the multi-faith movement for,2017-06-05,RELIGION,"A quiet but powerful march took place in Philadelphia last week, indicating a new direction in the faith-driven environmental justice movement in America. 
A coalition of climate activists and poverty activists walked through five counties and ended in Philadelphia to demand increases in solar power and the jobs it provides. The event, called Power Local Green Jobs, was the brainchild of Earth Quaker Action Team (EQUAT ) and Philadelphians Organized to Witness Empower and Rebuild (POWER), a group consisting of more than 40 congregations around the city and led by Reverend Greg Holston, an African American pastor who is intent on making the connection between economic and environmental justice. 
“Every single day, folks tell me about struggling to support their families. They need jobs, not programs. It’s time to build a green city that works for all,” ― Rev. Greg Holston
Rev. Holston was joined in the march by Bishop Dwayne Royster of Living Water United Church of Christ, another Black faith leader from Philadelphia whose congregation is deeply rooted within the traditions of the African-American Church.
Pastors like Holston and Royster view environmental justice as a spiritual and justice issue, and are among a growing number of faith leaders of color who are taking leadership roles within the environmental movement.
Bill McKibben, a White environmental justice advocate and founder of the climate-focused grassroots organization 350.org, was marching in Philadelphia alongside Rev. Holston and Bishop Royster. He is happy to see that leadership is changing to include more people of color.
“The first in line for the power and jobs would be frontline communities. That’s who was leading the way at the big climate march in Washington D.C. on April 29. I hope this change continues,” McKibben said.
This change is happening in part because of increasing recognition that communities of color are often most adversely affected in cases of environmental injustice. When Melissa Mays of Flint, Michigan, had had enough of the foul-smelling brown water flowing from her tap, one of the groups she turned to was Concerned Pastors for Social Justice, a network of religious leaders from more than 30 predominantly African-American churches in Flint and surrounding communities.
Formed more than a half-century ago to safeguard the lives of the underserved in the city, the network fought hard alongside the residents of Flint, who are over 60 percent African American or Hispanic, during water crisis that has been engulfing the city since 2014.
Last year, Concerned Pastors became one of the plaintiffs to file a lawsuit against the state and city officials requiring them to comply with Safe Drinking Water Act.
Just two months ago, plaintiffs and the state of Michigan agreed to settle the lawsuit for almost $100 million, and to replace miles of lead pipelines. Pastor Allen Overton of Concerned Pastors says they hope the settlement “helps heal the damage.”
In an effort to fight for environmental justice, the new breed of religious activists of color are putting together guidelines and taking concrete steps toward a better, broader, and more inclusive environmental movement in their racially diverse communities.
Alaura Carter, the Climate Justice Associate at Sojourners and a member of the committee that organized the People's Climate March in Washington D.C. in April, thinks that environment, like any other national issue, has a racial component.
""People of color in the United States are exposed to 38 percent more asthma-producing nitrogen dioxide than are White people.. [and] are twice as likely as Whites to live without potable water or modern sanitation."" -- Alaura Carter, Climate Justice Associate at Sojourners
By focusing on people and their daily lived experiences instead of theological ideas around faith and the environment, faith leaders of color are able to avoid the vagaries of what Carter calls the “big green” blanket movements, which ""sometimes overlook the people on the ground or do not represent them accurately,"" Carter added.
Reverend Leo Woodberry is the pastor of Kingdom Living Temple, an independent African-American church in Florence, South Carolina, a place hit by extreme weather such as the flooding in 2015 and Hurricane Matthew last year.
In March, Rev. Woodberry helped organize a free climate change event for his community. Speakers and groups from across the northeast and southeast came to train the citizens of Florence in the devastating impacts of climate change.
“Training people on what we need to do, whether we are in the middle of a heat wave and you have citizens who don’t have adequate cooling or cold weather where people don’t have adequate heating, is how we can address those problems and concerns,” said Rev. Woodberry.
Also one of the organizers of People's Climate March, he often talks about ""environomics"", referring to the intersection point ""... where the economy and environment meet and allows corporate polluters to come into communities and dump toxins because it’s profitable for them.”
""Environomics is ... where the economy and environment meet and allows corporate polluters to come into communities and dump toxins because it’s profitable for them."" -- Rev. Leo Woodberry, Kingdom Living Temple, S.C.
Reverend Dr. Neddy Astudillo is a leading Latina eco-theologian with the faith-based environmental advocacy group GreenFaith, and has recently attended National GreenLatinos summit in Monterrey, California. She emphasizes the connection between faith and ecology, including the need to live in healthy communities.
""When environmentalists and people of faith begin to work together and question the present social-environmental crisis, we clearly see how we can not achieve social justice without environmental justice and vice versa. All the players need to be at the table to seek solutions, or those that aren't 'will be on the menu',"" Rev. Astudillo said.
Some environmental justice leaders seek inspiration from the holy books.
Ibrahim Abdul-Matin is the Director of Community Affairs in Environmental Protection Department, overseeing 8.5 million people who drink or use New York City water every day. As a Muslim African American and author of the book Green Deen: What Islam Teaches About Protecting the Planet -- ""deen"" means ""religion"" in Arabic -- he believes that like all prophetic traditions, Islam also has at its very core an ecological imperative. In his advocacy for environmental justice for the underprivileged and the vulnerable communities, Abdul-Matin says he draws on the notion of ""adl"" (""justice""), one of the names of God in Islam:
""'Adl' is rooted in the notion of balance...When there's too much extraction from the earth, when people are working really hard but not making enough to live decently, when a small group of people have more than most people... then things are unbalanced and you have injustice,"" he said.

Educator.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/another-violent-ramadan_us_594f649fe4b0326c0a8d0926,"Imagine celebrating Hanukah, Christmas, Diwali or Easter in a political and social climate strewn with such hatred.",2017-06-25,RELIGION,"Around the world, Muslims are partaking in festivities for Eid-ul-Fitr, a religious holiday celebrating the end of a month-long fast. At home, in the U.S., the day also marks the end to another violent Ramadan representative of a larger pattern of intensifying Islamophobia.
While the murders of two American heroes, Ricky John Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche, in Oregon and a Muslim American teenager, Nabra Hassenan, near her local mosque in Virginia received considerable news coverage, a number of lesser-known acts and threats of anti-Muslim violence contributed to continued concerns about the minority faith group’s safety and security, not to mention the status of religious freedom in practice.
Alarmingly, over the course of a mere 30 days, fasting Muslims consumed a regular diet of physical assaults, verbal harassment and mosque attacks, among other Islamophobic incidents around the country. Consider the following distressing events:
 In New York, a Manhattan mosque received a threatening letter promising a massacre “on a scale never seen before;” In Boston, MA, a male passenger on a train physically assaulted a 61 year old Muslim American woman observing hijab after yelling Islamophobic slurs; In the Bronx, NY, a pellet gun shooter targeted a local mosque causing property damage; In Mathis, TX, a Muslim owned convenience store – that had previously received threats such as, “You are Muslim, we are going to burn your store,” – was set ablaze in an arson; In Denver, Colorado, mosques received a rash of hateful phone calls threatening violence; In Hickory Hills, Chicago, Muslim American teenage girls observing hijab were harassed while dining at a local restaurant; In Kent, Washington, a Muslim high school staff member received a threatening note stating, “F―― + Ramadan + All Muslims;” In Columbus, Ohio, an attacker yelled, “You will be shipped back to Africa,” at a Muslim woman observing hijab prior to beating her unconscious; In Santa Barbara, CA, a group of men verbally accosted a Muslim woman walking on a local college campus, laughing while threatening to get a gun; In South Florida, a mosque was evacuated after receiving a bomb threat; In Portland, OR, a man yelled “take the burka off, this is America, go back to your f***ing country,” at a Muslim couple while making hand gestures in the shape of a gun and pulling the “trigger;” and In Sacramento, CA, Muslims found desecrated Qur’ans outside two mosques. 
To better understand the traumatic impact of such anti-Muslim attacks in Ramadan, imagine celebrating Hanukah, Christmas, Diwali or Easter in a political and social climate strewn with such hatred. To be sure, rising Islamophobia isn’t confined to the Islamic holy month. Rather, it is part of a broader phenomenon threatening religious freedom every day in our country. In fact, according to the Council on American Islamic , acts and threats of perceived anti-Muslim violence increased by 44 percent in 2016.
Significantly, contemporary manifestations of Islamophobia also include unlawful discrimination in a variety of other contexts. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, for instance, approximately 40 per cent of its investigations into violations of federal religious land use law – that protects houses of worship and religious institutions from discrimination by zoning officials – involve Muslim Americans.
Additionally, data from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal government agency tasked with enforcing civil rights laws in the workplace, reveal that Muslim Americans account for 40 percent of all religious employment discrimination claims – a marked increase from 25 percent in 2009. And, according to the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, more than 40 percent of Muslim American parents report that their children have experienced bias-based bullying in school.
In other words, while Muslim Americans comprise just one to two percent of the entire U.S. population, the minority faith community is confronting grossly disproportionate levels of religious discrimination at work, in schools and the public square. But, now that you know this, what are you going to do in response?
In fact, amid growing Islamophobia, Americans have only one winning choice: stand united with your Muslim neighbors, classmates and co-workers against the forces of hatred and division that threatens who we are as a nation. 
And, so, while Ramadan may be drawing to a close, our shared struggle to protect religious freedom, the rule of law and our national values is only just beginning.

147,RELIGION,The Real Mover Is Love: A Conversation About Community Service With the Dalai Lama,"Matthew Weiner, ContributorMatthew Weiner is an Associate Dean in the Office of Religious...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dalai-lama-princeton_b_6154142.html,"Last week His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama came to Princeton University and met with a select group of students to discuss part of the University's informal motto, ""In the service of all nations.""",2014-11-14,RELIGION,"Last week His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama came to Princeton University and met with a select group of students to discuss part of the University's informal motto, ""In the service of all nations."" The motto was coined by Woodrow Wilson, and is the aspirational tag line, if you will, for the University. 
We asked this most famous Buddhist monk to reflect on the meaning of service as a way to think candidly among ourselves. Service has become a regular part of high school and college life in the past decades. Almost every student commits to some: out of their own initiative, urged to do so, or required. The role of His Holiness was to draw attention to service beyond those already interested, and to allow for a sincere conversation about its meaning- something he seemed naturally to elicit. 
In preparation, students met in small groups to learn from each other and to prepare a question. They asked themselves what counted as service, why engage in it, and what did they learn along the way? Were there problems with the idea of service, from the place they came from?
The questions, initiated by a panel of scholars, were provocative through their self-reflective and honest nature: recognizing Princeton's place of privilege, wondering about the relationship between service and scholarship, acknowledging our less than perfect past, and asking if we really walked the talk on our high aims. 
Might the Dalai Lama agree with the implicit self-critiques? He often cautions against the pursuit of prestige, for example. Yet this was not the direction he chose. Instead, he consistently reflected on the value of compassion. How to integrate service and scholarship? Compassion must be at the root. How to choose the kind of service to commit to? Develop compassion. Was a big salary against the rules of compassion? Not if you approached the results with compassion. 
By some accounts he did not always address what was asked, but the compass directing his answers was clear: your intentions matter, develop your heart, be honest with yourself, work very hard at these things, and let them direct your efforts. Such action, and this is indeed activity, must precede any external action of service for it to be genuine and sustainable. The real mover, he said, is love. 
When pushed on how such compassion is feasible even in the face of hatred and prejudice, he acknowledged that his moral strategy was decidedly hard work. From a Buddhist perspective it will take lifetimes to get it right. For all of his laughter and visible ease, the Dalai Lama is a serious man playing the long game. He has spent a lifetime studying texts on this very topic. He rises daily at 3:00 a.m. to meditate for three hours. His impossible goal, put forth through sacred vows, is to save all beings from suffering. But is it really possible, Prof. Eddie Glaude asked urgently. Professors were not born as professors, the Dalai Lama responded with a laugh. First they had to learn the alphabet, then to read and write. Now look at them!
And how to convince the uninterested to engage in service? Some say it should be a requirement. The Dalai Lama suggested that motivating others was best done not through argument, law, or command, but through the trigger of one's affection for others. Affection, after all, can only be learned from one another. Affection is full in younger people, he surmised, but by the age of college, it can fade. 
It was like this that he implicitly challenged us, be it his implications that we haven't yet learned the alphabet when it comes to developing our hearts, or that if want to live differently we may sacrifice superficial things we hold dear. The Dalai Lama is a known master of upaya, skillful means, and while he can go toe to toe with world-class philosophers and neuroscientists, and has informed opinions on economic restructuring, his agenda was quietly calculated. As a scholar-monk he has often noted that American universities were adept at developing the mind, but not the heart. Even in service work, how often do we think seriously about developing our capacity for love? And unless we draw a correlation between academic excellence and kindheartedness, we can assume that the students, faculty, and staff at top tier schools are no more skilled at compassionate action than anyone else. 
The Dalai Lama talked about service in ways different from our leaders who highlight examples of exemplary action and quantifiable results. He drew attention instead to our intentions because he knows they need work. He was not satisfied with our engagement, and instead told us to redouble our efforts. Is there really a place for selfless work and internal development in the academy and our wider public? 
There must be if this aging monk, and the unprecedented positive response he receives wherever he goes, is any indication. For someone who has suffered the loss of his country yet remains serious about compassion, the Dalai Lama is downright likeable, happy, and goofy. He makes everyone around him smile. If care about service but dismiss this as unimportant, then we misunderstand the quiet enterprise of compassion, the humility it brings, its most serious challenge, and its value for all of us.

148,RELIGION,This Pastor Self-Immolated To Protest Social Injustice,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rev-charles-moore-self-immolation_n_5584506.html,,2014-07-15,RELIGION,"On June 23 of this year, Rev. Charles Moore stepped out of his car in a shopping mall parking lot in Grand Saline, Texas and set himself on fire. The retired United Methodist pastor was 79 years old and was a life long advocate for social justice. He died later that night at Parkland Hospital in Dallas -- leaving behind a trail of notes and a lifetime of activism to offer an explanation for his dramatic act.
As social justice advocate Reverend Jeff Hood told The Huffington Post, Rev. Moore was trying to send a message with his dramatic act -- both to the United Methodist Church and to the country at large. ""Reverend Moore thought this was going to be a whole lot bigger of a deal than it turned out to be,"" Hood told HuffPost. ""He expected it to make national news.""
Texas-based Tyler Morning Telegraph obtained a copy of one of the notes Moore left behind from the Grand Saline police, and it offers a glimpse into a man deeply troubled by injustice and racism and who carried this pain for decades. He describes the racial discrimination that existed in his hometown of Grand Saline when he was growing up and which often lead to horrific violence. Moore wrote:
""I will soon be 80 years old, and my heart is broken over this. America, and Grand Saline... have never really repented for the atrocities of slavery and its aftermath. What my hometown needs to do is open its heart and its doors to black people as a sign of the rejection of past sins.""
In addition to his hometown, Moore faulted the United Methodist Church for failing to reverse what he saw as backward, discriminatory practices like homophobia and support for the death penalty. In other notes Moore reportedly expressed frustration over his alma mater Southern Methodist University's successful bid to house the George W. Bush Presidential Center. Earlier letters may have even suggested he originally planned to commit suicide on the school's campus in protest.
In a note dated June 16, 2014, Moore wrote:
""This decision to sacrifice myself was not impulsive: I have struggled all my life (especially the last several years) with what it means to take Dietrich Bonhoeffer's insistence that Christ calls a person to come and die seriously. He was not advocating self-immolation, but others have found this to be the necessary deed, as I have myself for some time now: it has been a long Gethsemane, and excruciating to keep my plans from my wife and other members of our family."" 
Rev. Hood also uses the metaphor of Jesus at Gethsemane to challenge any who would criticize Moore. In an article on his website Hood writes:
The temptation of the hour will be to turn our heads and call The Rev. Charles Moore insane. If we do we should also turn our heads from Jesus and call him insane too. For we must not forget, Jesus sat in the Garden of Gethsemane and made a conscious clear decision to step out into death...just like Moore.
People who knew Moore recall a man deeply committed to his beliefs and who spent a lifetime working toward social justice. Rev. Jack Albright, who knew Moore in Carthage, Texas and worked with him during the civil rights movement, told the Dallas News:
""When people are raised and spend their life in an atmosphere of segregation, it's very threatening to make changes. The issue was how hard do you push, especially if you are going to create a lot of confrontation.""
Moore's son-in-law Rev. Bill Renfro told the United Methodist News Service that there should have been someone in the pastor's community to help him manage his sense of guilt. 
""It would have been nice to have had some sort of counseling, somebody to point out that his life had mattered, that he hadn't failed. He had done plenty.""
Despite Renfro's sentiments, Moore's letters suggest that he was intent upon using his own death to inspire action in those around him. In one note he reportedly wrote:
""I would much prefer to go on living and enjoy my beloved wife and grandchildren and others, but I have come to believe that only my self-immolation will get the attention of anybody and perhaps inspire some to higher service.""
More important than the act of self-immolation, however, is the message Moore was trying to send, Hood told HuffPost. “I don’t know that the answer lies in the fact that he burned himself to death,"" Hood said. ""The answer lies in why he burned himself to death and why that matters.”
Rev. Dr. Sid Hall, who worked on social justice actions with Moore since the 1990s, also said that the manner of Moore's death is not as crucial as his message. ""I am very clear that his act was not a suicide in the sense we usually think about it,"" Hall told HuffPost. ""I know this because Charles was driven not by escapism, but engagement.""
The question of why Moore's act matters lies in something Hood referred to as ""radical discipleship,"" which Moore demonstrated throughout his life. He helped organize the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty (TCADP), for instance, which operates today as a resource for those opposed to capital punishment. 
And in 1995 he went on hunger strike in hopes of persuading the Council of Bishops, which was meeting in Austin, to change the Book of Discipline's language on homosexuality, which states among other things that ""the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.""
Rev. Hood, who also serves on the board of TCADP and advocates for LGBT acceptance, describes the role Moore's activism has played in his own life: 
""Because Moore lived, I am able to do the work that I do. My respect for Moore is unwavering and I am proud to follow in his footsteps. Jesus asks us to give our lives and Moore did.""
For any who feel inspired by Moore's life work but who are troubled by the way he died, Rev. Hall told HuffPost, the key is to continue moving forward:
""I believe the primary lesson we must take from Charles’s life-long convictions, even as we struggle with the way he chose to die, is that we must remain awake to the horrors that surround us and work together to interrupt them, in the name of our deepest humanity and for those of us who are Christian, in the name of Christ.""

149,RELIGION,Fighting For Our Sons In A Culture That Seeks To Destroy Them,"Erendira Ramirez-Ortega, ContributorContributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fighting-for-our-sons-in-a-culture-that-seeks-to-destroy_us_57ca5f1de4b0b9c5b738a30e,"As I drove my boys to a new neighborhood in the area, we heard on the radio about a recall drive to oust a judge who gave",2016-09-03,RELIGION,"As I drove my boys to a new neighborhood in the area, we heard on the radio about a recall drive to oust a judge who gave a light sentence to Brock Turner, the Stanford student who was convicted in March of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman at a fraternity party in January 2015. The light sentence drew harsh criticism from prosecutors and advocates and prompted widespread fury on social media because Turner received only six months in jail and three years of probation after a judge became worried that a stiffer sentence would have a “severe impact” on the 20-year-old. (Source: Washington Post)
The outrage of this injustice is palpable.
This morning, I looked at a video of another case involving a mom who protected her daughter from a madman attempting to kidnap her, in broad daylight, at a dollar store. He was caught running away in the store parking lot by an off-duty officer. If that isn’t a miracle, I don’t know what is.
When I look at the headlines that clamor through our media outlets about all the wickedness in our society, what comes to my mind is Noah in the age of the flood, spared from total destruction by the mighty hand of God. What would compel God to end it all except for Noah’s family?
 “And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.” Genesis 6:5 
Take a moment to imagine the biblical age, and then wonder for a moment the degree of evil that moved the hand of God to bring justice across the entire land with the power of obliteration. I’m sure many who perished in the flood cried for mercy, however, too late.
Today we cry for justice. We can see when someone has been wronged or when something is not right or when a sentence is unjust. The case in Stanford gives us pause—not because it’s yet another tragic incident in our country, not because it is abhorrent how the judge ruled a sentence—but because it’s time we took a look at the crisis our boys face in the 21st century.
I homeschool my children and wherever we find ourselves at any given time of the week, I am vigilant. In college, I took a self-defense course that taught me the modes of self-awareness, of relying on instinct to warn us of impending danger, of using our voice to scream and using our bodies to fight against assaults. Some women in my class were already victims of a crime, while some were preparing themselves for this new life: college, a predatory zone. We were all women. We were trained to be vigilant.
We can deduce that perhaps Turner, the rapist, is without God, but I’ll choose to be silent on the matter; I don’t care to entertain conjecture. He was once a boy, who developed through his formative years under the care of those who raised him. Now we, as parents, whether we homeschool or not, need to have a conversation about what’s happening in our world today. When we see sin, what do we do about it; what will our sons and our daughters do? The Stanford rape case prompts a response from all of us who have children, regardless.
As we raise our boys to become men, it’s fine to celebrate that sweetness they possess as little ones yet to be fully draped with the rough edges endowed by their father, an armor that will shape them for battle in a world that compels them to dodge all its daggers. The enemy is at work to bring to perdition our sons and we must fight for them to be formed in holiness by our Lord.
 “And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:” Ephesians 2:1 
 “And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.” 1 John 5:19 
As mothers, how do we raise our boys to be men? How do we project a sweet spirit when we are worn, a meekness when we are frustrated, a quietness when we are boiling over?
I hold on by a string sometimes, recalling in those precarious moments of distress the essence of my calling as a mom, how much I wanted to do my labor and delivery by the book. I was only two years into my marriage when I gave birth to my first child, a child I remember taking to the window of the hospital at dawn, praising God for the grace He bestowed me. My little guy, my gift from God, who at only 6 pounds, 15 ounces was the embodiment of greatness and fortitude. This little guy, years later, would become a force to be reckoned with. I wasn’t alone as my mother was when she birthed and raised me. I had a husband and a life filled with God’s grace and a life redeemed by the Saviour.
When I was sent home into motherhood without the pampering of nurses and doctors to direct my handling of my newborn, I was amazed that it was just my baby, me and my husband left to root ourselves into parenthood alone. We would bloom where we’d be planted and water our lives with the word of God to grow strong in His purpose. Now, as we continue to define our lives by God’s terms and do our best to raise our two boys and girl with His strength, for His glory, I struggle to get a hold of all that is urged of me, because truthfully, my husband and I are pioneering through the road of homeschooling, something so unfamiliar to our extended families. We’re taking a new direction for our lives by homeschooling, trusting in the Lord every day. We don’t want to rust out on this, or become complacent.
Our children should see a picture of Christ in our marriage, one that is selfless, that magnifies Him in word and in deed. It’s not easy to do as it goes contrary to social norms, to family traditions. It is a swim against the current, to teach our children to have self-respect, to live in a dignified way, to do something when injustice is in full view; to stand up for something, lest they fall for everything, as the saying goes. Teaching our boys to treat girls with kindness needs to be intentional because if they don’t, they’ll leave them wounded like I was as a child, the memory of it not easily shaken off after all these years. Like the victim in the Stanford case said: “My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me.”
So what do we do?
We need to teach our boys to fight for the victim. God did, and we should too. He fought for the woman who was about to be bludgeoned to death with stones and He rescued her from a life of sin. We need to be compassionate for those who are lost. If we’re saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, we can be used of Him to help a lost person find their way to freedom from the chains of sin. As we do this, we also should stick up for those who are treated unfairly. Women, being the weaker vessel, doesn’t signify God thinks less of them; but rather, He knows they are to be given honor because for them He died too. And let’s remember that God knows women better than we do. Let’s point our sons to the women in the Bible who were used as mighty vessels for fulfilling God’s purpose. Esther, Mary, Rahab, Sara, and on and on the list goes. God loves us all and He wants to use us, but we must decide to follow Him first, to give of ourselves as He did, to live our lives to magnify His name, not ours.
We need to teach our boys that sin destroys. The mainstream media is an expert at painting a broad brush on gun ownership, but it bears narrowing the stroke a bit: People with guns who kill should be prosecuted. People who drink alcohol and commit crimes should be prosecuted. The root cause here is the same: people. And the culprit is sin. Sin abounds and as parents we should warn our children of all its manifestations. I was convicted about one thing when my eldest son was attending a private Christian school. His classmate had a backpack of an immoral celebrity athlete and I thought to myself, Is this his hero? Why are sinful men praised by Christians just because they can play ball and have accumulated wealth? These are the anti-heroes and our boys would be wise to not look to them as role models.
We need to teach our daughters that it is fine to not give themselves freely to everyone. It is not a character flaw to be guarded and to retain a gentle distance. My daughter has what I never did; she has copious amounts of sweet personality and a friendly spirit. We call her our diamond in the rough. I’ve said that she is cake and my boys are gravy. At the library, she invites other little girls to be her friend. She gets rejected at times, with no response at all, or with a blatant no from these little strangers, but my girl has tough skin. She can move to another corner of the playground or wading pool and find herself entertained there alone. I look at this as God preparing her for the hard lessons in life, as young as she is. Not everyone will like her. Not everyone is nice. Not everyone is a friend. Our daughters have to find their value in the gifts that God has given them so they can exalt His name in all that they do.
I read a meme somewhere that admonished moms to be closer to their children rather than to their husbands because, the point was, children stay in our lives forever, and husbands cheat and leave. Reading such things is a sad testament to what the world believes of the family and its design, devoid of God’s order.
If our boys in this age are to walk in Christ-likeness, we need to first pattern our marriage as the self-sacrificing mystery it is, the unfailing love of God that is the foundation of Christ’s death on the cross. He gave His life for us and thus, we give our lives for our spouses. Our children pick up on this model and may follow it, but it needs to be ever so present in their lives, for they one day will bring it to bear when they form their own families. And this will become what they hinge to when our sons, eventually, find their own bride.
 “Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the Lord.” Proverbs 18:22 
As parents to sons, in particular, we must educate our boys to take responsibility for their decisions. As godly men stand alone in the face of the world that waits as a predator to bring them to ruin, we must (as moms raising boys to become men) allow them to get hurt. There’s no redemptive quality in the letter from Brock Turner’s father, who defends his convicted son in a manner that doesn’t hold his son’s feet to the fire of accountability and responsibility. As an adjunct some years ago, I recall assigning work to my writing class, giving them ample time to prepare before the due date. A student came to me in the eleventh hour to ask for help. He had nothing to show for the assignment. I remember telling him he was going to fail. Classroom life is an extension of life beyond. It takes no effort to fail for it is harder to gain victories, isn’t it?
Likewise, we can’t wait until the eleventh hour to teach our boys responsibility. Parents needn’t make excuses for their children when they’ve decided to live unrighteously. Teaching them to love the Lord, to model Christ’s love for all—men, women, and children, orphans, and widows—changes the course of society. We know that a society is a collection of families and therefore, as we strengthen our own with the love of Christ, we are better able to make a difference in this darkened world.

My Staff Chaplain position at the then Naval Station Great Lakes, Il command was eliminated due to the infamous budget balancing legislative act known as Gramm, Rudman ,Hollings. This legislation passed despite not being terribly popular with significant numbers of Republican and Democratic legislators.
This was a very terrible time for me. I couldn't get a pastoral call to a local United Church Of Christ congregation in the greater Chicago, Il Milwaukee, Wi corridor to save my soul.
I felt awful that I couldn't support my family financially. I ended up working for several months at a pizza restaurant prior to going back to graduate school to get a Master's Degree in Social Work.
My wife's grandmother known for her colorful personality and equally memorable commentary stated:
""Peter is working at preacher hut ! ""
Yes, it was true, I had a Masters In Divinity degree from Princeton, several years parish ministry and active duty experience as a Navy Chaplain. Now I was working at the preparation table assembling pizzas, serving as a restaurant host and attempting to operate a cash register.
I did manage to do well in this position. I am thankful that I was able to work at that time. I learned a great deal about myself and the working lives of others. I sent out a lot of copies of my ministerial profile, got a lot of rejection letters and hardly received any support from denominational officials.
I wish that I could tell you that the church denominations have learned something in the past twenty-seven plus years with regard to taking care of clergy and supporting them in pastoral placement and during the course of their ministry.
Alas, they haven't learned a thing. We are currently witnessing decreased attendance in Protestant churches across the board with the exception of Mega-Church Fundamentalist congregations. More and more churches cannot financially support a full-time minister. More and more congregations are closing their doors, selling or attempting to sell their property, including the closing of Beacon Hill Presbyterian Church in San Antonio, TX that occurred one year ago ( see my previous blog entries What Do You Do When The Beacon Goes Out? And Beacon Hill Is Bleeding ), large congregations are seeking to break away from mainline Protestant denominations due to conflicts over church doctrine and social justice policies, denominational leaders appear to be more concerned about protecting their own positions as opposed to extending ministry to anyone.
A recent broadcast of "" Religion And Ethics Weekly Report "" ( PBS 05/31/2015 ) highlighted three recent seminary graduates, all of them male. One is 57 and is currently working at a shopping mall as a security guard. He has been trying to get a call to a church but is concerned that he is too old and that a church would be more inclined to call a younger pastor. Another is a filmmaker working for a non-profit organization, and another is unemployed, staying at home with his spouse and children and trying to survive.
Where is the support from the denominations and from the seminaries and divinity schools for these people ?
For that matter, is anyone doing any research and tracking the data regarding the rates of divorces, financial bankruptcy, the costs for physical and mental health care including any inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations, domestic violence, substance abuse and suicide rates for these unemployed seminary/divinity school graduates and their families ?
Recently, both Eden Theological Seminary Webster Groves, Mo and Austin Theological Seminary Austin, TX have closed their theological bookstores. Luther Theological Seminary St. Paul, MN. has been forced to eliminate half of its full-time faculty due to budgetary challenges.
In the Religion And Ethics broadcast, the Dean of Yale Divinity School Greg Sterling stated:
""We have a big problem when average student debt is fifty thousand ( 50,000 ) dollars and the average ministerial salary is thirty-five thousand ( 35,000) dollars. ""
Currently there are less seminary/divinity school graduates who are going into parish ministry and more numbers are going into chaplaincy including hospital chaplaincy and working for non-profit organizations.
These certainly are very important ministries. That being said, we have a critical need for young and not so young, bright, gifted, talented and well educated local parish clergy to be effective leaders of congregations. This is especially relevant now with the current struggles of urban violence involving police departments, increasing income inequality along with the rise of poverty and homelessness and increasing concern for world climate sustainability due to global warming.
We need to have a radical change in policy in terms of how we prepare persons for ordained ministry.
It's not 1950 anymore.
My recourse is that anyone who I speak to who is interested in pursuing ordained ministry, I'm advising them to only consider applying to dual track programs ( i.e. M. DIV and MSW, M.DIV and JD Law degree, M. DIV and MBA etc. ). Princeton Theological Seminary Princeton, N.J. and Rutgers School Of Social Work, Rutgers University New Brunswick, N.J. have long sponsored such a dual track program. The University Of Texas at Austin,TX and Austin Theological Seminary Austin, TX are sponsoring and offering a dual track program for M.DIV and MSSW and M.DIV and JD Law degree.
This is a far better ethical mode for preparing future church leaders. Here at least, there is a greater opportunity and probability that a graduate will find able and meaningful work instead of long-term unemployment and misery due to the limitations with the present M.DIV alone system.
We need to do better in supporting our current clergy and also supporting and cultivating the clergy of the future. Denominational organizations need to reach out and support their people instead of being concerned about protecting their own positions of power and privilege.
This needs to happen NOW, not another twenty-seven years plus from now.
By the way, I still make a pretty good pizza.

151,RELIGION,China Says Dalai Lama 'Profanes' Buddhism By Doubting His Reincarnation,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/china-dalai-lama-reincarnation_n_6829610.html,,2015-03-09,RELIGION,"Exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama is profaning Buddhism by suggesting that he will not be reincarnated when he dies, the Chinese-appointed governor of Tibet said on Monday, in some of China's strongest comments to date on the subject.
Tibetan Buddhism holds that the soul of a senior lama is reincarnated in the body of a child on his death. China says the tradition must continue and it must approve the next Dalai Lama.
But the Nobel peace laureate, who fled his homeland in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule, has said he thinks the title could end when he dies.
He has also stated that he will not be reborn in China if Tibet is not free and that no one, including China, has the right to choose his successor ""for political ends.""
Speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of parliament, Tibet governor Padma Choling accused the Dalai Lama of flip-flopping with his various pronouncements on the issue, and of hypocrisy seeing as he himself was reincarnated.
""If the central government had not approved it, how could he have become the 14th Dalai Lama? He couldn't. It has a serious procedure,"" Padma Choling, an ethnic Tibetan himself, told reporters.
""I think that, in fact, he is profaning religion and Tibetan Buddhism,"" he said, adding that the Dalai Lama was trying to usurp Beijing's right to decide.
""If he says no reincarnation then no reincarnation? Impossible. Nobody in Tibetan Buddhism would agree to that,"" he added. ""We must respect history, respect and not profane Tibetan Buddhism.""
Exiles worry that China might just simply appoint their own successor. In 1995, after the Dalai Lama named a boy in Tibet as the reincarnation of the previous Panchen Lama, the second highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism, China put that boy under house arrest and installed another in his place.
Many Tibetans spurn the Chinese-appointed Panchen Lama as a fake.
China's officially atheist Communist Party says it has inherited the right of the old emperors to sign off on reincarnations, though how important the custom was is historically disputed.
China routinely rejects criticism of its policies in Tibet, saying its rule, since Communist Chinese troops ""peacefully liberated"" the region in 1950, ended serfdom and brought development to a backward, poverty-stricken region.
Beijing says the Dalai Lama, who fled to India after the 1959 uprising, is a ""wolf in sheep's clothing"" who seeks to use violent methods to establish an independent Tibet. The Dalai Lama says he only wants genuine autonomy for Tibet and denies advocating independence or violence. (Editing by Nick Macfie)

The former capture the headlines, the latter are often overlooked.
Dr. Edward Kessler of Cambridge University is a star of interfaith dialogue. Described by The Times Higher Education Supplement in 2007 as “probably the most prolific interfaith figure in British academia,” Dr. Kessler is the Founder Director of the Woolf Institute at Cambridge, which aims to study relations among and between Jews, Christians, and Muslims. An expert on relations between the Abrahamic faiths, Dr. Kessler has written or edited more than a dozen books and countless articles and partnered with such senior faith leaders as the Pope and the Chief Rabbi of the UK on a number of initiatives. He has received numerous prestigious awards and sits on many important committees.
Dr. Kessler is also a respected visitor in the Arab world, welcomed by scholars and sheikhs. They recognize in him a kindred spirit.
Describing Judaism and Islam as ‘incredibly close and intimate religions,’ Dr. Kessler considers the founding of the Woolf Institute in 1998 to be his most significant accomplishment. He is particularly proud of the new building the Institute has just opened this term, a feat rare on the hallowed grounds of Cambridge: ‘The first new building devoted to interfaith relations for a generation at a time when society most needs it.’
Dr. Kessler and I together launched the popular online course ‘Bridging the Great Divide: the Jewish-Muslim Encounter’ several years back and continue to teach it jointly representing our respective universities. The course studies historical and contemporary relations between the faiths and seeks to provide a space for members of the Jewish and Muslim communities, among others, to transcend their differences and explore paths to building bridges. I have come to truly believe that learning with members of different communities has a profound effect on students, and seeing strangers come together across faith lines during the course of the term and shift their perceptions of the other is one of the greatest and most satisfying joys I can experience as a teacher. I know Dr. Kessler views the experience with similar enthusiasm.
My daughter, Dr. Amineh Hoti, has had the great privilege of working with Dr. Kessler in Cambridge over the years as well. Having received her PhD from Cambridge, Dr. Kessler requested Amineh to serve as the founding director of the first-ever such centre in Europe, the Centre for the Study of Muslim-Jewish Relations, and an extension of his established Centre for Jewish-Christian Studies, shortly after 9/11.Through her courses, lectures, articles and books, she was thus able to bring an Islamic perspective to the teaching of religion in Britain. Rabbis, Imams and priests attended her courses. During her five-year tenure, she made great strides in strengthening relations between the Jewish, Christian and Muslim communities. As a result of activist scholars like her and Dr. Kessler, the perspective of society as Judeo-Christian was seen increasingly as Judeo-Christian-Islamic, which directly challenged the growing Islamophobia.
Dr. Kessler, in an extended interview for my Journey into Europe study, explained how modern Judaism has gained significantly from Islamic philosophy: “I’d say that the whole of medieval Jewish philosophy could not have come into existence without Islamic philosophy. The rules of literature and grammar are basically taken from Muslim grammarians.”
Dr. Kessler also noted the similarities between the Muslim and Jewish experience in the West today, “I think Muslims are still seen as an ‘other.’ And Jews understand this because we have been another for a very long time and remain so. And there is a sense of otherness of Islam. And it beholds, I think, the Muslim community to strive to get across the values of Islam and how it very much fits into the religious landscape of this country.”
Among the many figures who inspire him, Dr. Kessler looks to such key historical leaders in his work as Ibn Averroes ‘because of his willingness to engage with Christian and Jewish interlocutors’ and Pope John Paul II ‘because he showed how one leader can encourage over a billion followers to engage in dialogue with Jews and Muslims and others.’
Dr. Kessler is presently pursuing a new project titled “Fundamentalism Uncovered,” a two-year research project which aims to explore how fundamentalism is expressed in different faith traditions, Abrahamic and non-Abrahamic alike, as well as the similarities within fundamentalist faith traditions. It is the first project of its kind to be pursued in more than two decades.
Ultimately, Dr. Kessler finds that for Jews and Muslims to come together, healthy dialogue, with respect and understanding, must be fostered. But dialogue needs to be approached with patience and empathy for the other.
Dr. Kessler recently told me of a powerful metaphor for promoting relations across faith lines. As a parent of three children who ‘are very different from one another,’ he notes that each child has different needs which he and his wife must respond to accordingly. “If we favored one at the cost of the others, we would have failed as parents.” He then applied the argument to theology: “If that is true of human parents, how much more is it true of God?”

A promotional video accompanying the message says the network will showcase “a new voice.” The e-meter is also featured in the clip, a device described in the video as “the cutting edge of spiritual technology.”
The organization’s reference to telling their side of the story is likely in response to the documentaries and programs focused on the controversial inner-workings of the church reported by ex-members ― including Alex Gibney’s HBO documentary “Going Clear: Scientology & The Prison Of Belief” and Leah Remini’s A&E show, “Scientology and the Aftermath.”
HuffPost’s Yashar Ali previously reported in November that at least three of the women accusing actor Danny Masterson of rape are Scientologists. Despite evidence, sources told HuffPost that investigations into the matters stalled. Masterson is a longtime member of the church, which has been accused of covering up allegations of misconduct against the organization and its members.
Reports on the organization launching a media network have been around since 2016, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

The decisions came in the wake of the Supreme Court's rejection of appeals to strike down same-sex marriage in several states, including Indiana.
On Wednesday Notre Dame notified employees of the change by email, saying: 
""Notre Dame is a Catholic university and endorses a Catholic view of marriage. However, it will follow the relevant civil law and begin to implement this change immediately.""
A spokesperson for Saint Mary's, a Catholic women's school, told South Bend Tribune that the college would also immediately comply with the law and extend benefits to all married spouses of employees.
""Being an out staff member, I feel a lot more confident that my concerns are being heard and responded to,"" Aaron Nichols, an openly gay staff member at Notre Dame, told South Bend Tribune. ""The university is no longer acting in a vacuum. That makes me proud to be ND.""
On Monday the Supreme Court declined to interfere with rulings that allow same-sex marriage in Virginia, Utah, Oklahoma, Indiana and Wisconsin, which many saw as a precedent that could pave the way for further acceptance of gay marriage around the country. 
Despite the announcements from Notre Dame and Saint Mary's, many private religious schools and institutions still refuse to comply with federal rulings on same-sex marriage and employee non-discrimination. Holy Cross College, Ancilla College, Bethel College and Goshen College -- all religious schools in Indiana -- currently do not offer benefits to same-sex spouses. 
In Massachusetts, where gay marriage is also legal, a private Christian school Gordon College signed onto a letter of faith-based organizations in July petitioning the Obama administration for exemption from employee non-discrimination regulations on the basis of religious objection to same-sex relationships.
The debate has also come to bear in cases where employees are fired after coming out as LGBT. In July, Olivia Reichert and Christina Gambaro were asked to resign from Cor Jesu Academy, an all-girls Catholic high school, when the institution learned of the couple's marriage. 
Missouri, where Cor Jesu is located, does not allow same-sex marriages but does recognize those performed in other states. Reichert and Gambaro got married in New York over the summer, but felt they had no legal grounds on which to appeal their firing.
""The law is not on our side, nor is the church,"" Gambaro wrote on Facebook, ""so we have no ground to stand on.”

It’s been called the “love hormone” and the “cuddle chemical,” but doctors and scientists know it as oxytocin, a hormone secreted by the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland during times of love and bonding.
A recent study spearheaded by Duke University social psychologist Patty Van Cappellen found that participants who received doses of oxytocin reported a greater sense of spirituality than those who received a placebo.
“Oxytocin appears to be part of the way our bodies support spiritual beliefs,” Van Cappellen said in a statement.
For research purposes, the study defined spirituality as a sense of connection to a higher power or to the world that gives meaning to people’s lives.
Eighty-three men between the ages of 35 to 64 participated in the study. Each participant received either a dose of oxytocin or a placebo, administered through a nasal spray.
Researchers found that those who received oxytocin were more likely to report feeling that spirituality was important in their lives and that life has meaning and purpose. They were also more likely to give higher ratings to statements like, “All life is interconnected” and “There is a higher plane of consciousness or spirituality that binds all people.”
Participants also listened to a guided meditation, after which those who received oxytocin reported experiencing more positive emotions like awe, gratitude, hope, inspiration, interest, love and serenity than those who received a placebo.
The study’s results held true regardless of whether the participant reported belonging to an organized religion or not, and they remained consistent a week after the hormone and placebo were administered.
Van Cappellen noted that the results of the study could only be applied to men given that the research subjects were all males. Oxytocin produces slightly different results in men and women, she said, and thus further studies should investigate the hormone’s role on women’s spirituality.
Even among men, the effect might not be uniform. The study also showed that oxytocin has a stronger spiritual effect on people with a particular variant of the CD38 gene, which regulates the release of oxytocin from hypothalamic neurons in the brain.
“Spirituality is complex and affected by many factors,” Van Cappellen said. “However, oxytocin does seem to affect how we perceive the world and what we believe.”
But Van Cappellen isn’t alone in her findings. Previous studies have shown oxytocin to have a profound impact on spirituality, as well as generosity, altruism, and empathy. Oxytocin has also been shown to play a role in experiences of spiritual transformation.
But it has a dark side, too.
A 2010 study of Dutch males out of the University of Amsterdam found that male subjects who received a dose of oxytocin were more likely to express ethnocentric prejudice and xenophobia than those who received a placebo.
Luckily, spirituality isn’t bound by hormones alone. It’s how we choose to define our spirituality ― whether as a connection to all creation on our global home or loyalty only to those who look, act and believe as we do ― that makes all the difference.

156,RELIGION,North Carolina Vs. Freedom of Religion,"Fr. Peter-Michael Preble, ContributorMinister in the United Church of Christ, Living Historian & Cu...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-vs-freedom_b_5241402.html,"If we are going to fight for the rights to exercise our faith as our conscience dictates, as is our Constitutional right in the United States, then we must get behind this lawsuit in North Carolina as this is, plain and simple, a freedom of religion question.",2014-05-01,RELIGION,"One of the most prized tenets of our American experience is the freedom of religion. So sacred is this concept of non-interference that it is enshrined in the Constitution of the United States and has been the subject of much debate these last few years. The Roman Catholic Church claims that forcing the Church to pay abortions or contraception is a violation of the free practice of the religion. A group of Roman Catholic nuns have sued for the same purpose and then there is the famous Hobby Lobby case and the case of the baker in Arizona who refused to bake a cake for a same sex couple and was sued by them. But what happens when the government passes, or tries to pass, a law that makes it illegal to practice what someone's faith allows them to practice?
On April 28, 2014 the United Church of Christ filed a law suit challenging the North Carolina's ban on same sex marriage. The lawsuit claims that the first article of the North Carolina law makes it a crime for clergy to officiate a marriage between two people of the same sex and therefore limits the practice of their faith as described by their particular denomination. 
Being a decentralized church the UCC has allowed the congregations themselves to decide if they will allow their clergy to officiate at same-sex marriages and UCC churches in North Carolina do wish to officiate at such marriages. The UCC has recognized same-sex marriage since 2005. This now becomes a freedom of religion case and the question I have is, why are more churches not joining in this fight for freedom of religion?
I am a strict separationist and even though I do not support the idea of same-sex marriage I do support the right for churches to decide for themselves if they will or will not bless such unions. In my mind there is no difference in the ""violation of consciousness"" that the Roman Catholic Church claims by being forced to pay for abortions and contraception, then this ""violation of consciousness"" by making it a crime for clergy to officiate at a marriage that their particular church deems appropriate.
One of the often spoken misperceptions of the anti same-sex marriage group during the run up to the legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, was that the government would force churches to perform same-sex marriages, well that has proven not to be the case, but the truth is the government has made it illegal, in North Carolina anyway, for clergy to perform marriages, so the reverse has come true.
If you study American history, especially history concerning freedom of religion, the legislators and commentators of the day were not afraid of the church interfering in the work of the government, but the fear was of the government interfering in the work of the church! It would seem their fears have been realized.
As a supporter of freedom, all freedoms, I support anyone's right to say anything they want. If it is slanderous they will have to face the consequences, but I support their right of free speech even if I do not agree with what they are saying. The gun lobby claims that the Second Amendment gives them the right to keep and bear arms without restriction. You want to own an Uzi, own one. I don't agree with that philosophy but I do agree they have the right to believe that and say that and fight for that right, that is what makes America, well, America!
Restriction of freedom is a slippery slope and just as the anti same-sex marriage group was warning about the government forcing me to marry same-sex people, I have to ask if this is allowed to stand, what will be next? What will the next intrusion of the government be on the free exercise of religion?
If we are going to fight for the rights to exercise our faith as our conscience dictates, as is our Constitutional right in the United States, then we must get behind this lawsuit in North Carolina as this is, plain and simple, a freedom of religion question. I do not have to agree with what they want the freedom to do, but I do agree with the right to do it!

157,RELIGION,Are You For Us or For Our Enemies,"Jonathan Walton, ContributorFollower of Jesus, Husband to Priscilla, Poet & Author, Direct...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/are-you-for-us-or-for-our_b_6369020.html,"When I found out about the Eric Garner decision, I did not know how to respond. But my first instinct was not to stop. It was to go and do something. And I surely didn't pause to find my favorite worship song or let alone ask, ""Lord, what would you have me to do?""",2014-12-23,RELIGION,"We want to be right, more than we want to be righteous. We live in a divided state of america, in a united state of amnesia, captive to our history and indifferent to the need of a future with room enough for everyone. We SHOUT subtle obscenities in capital letters on social media and evening newscasts at whomever we deem to be the other - not knowing that we have crushed the image of God in our brothers and sisters and hushed His image within ourselves. 
This is painfully evident in the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown and hateful speech from protesters to police, police to protesters and leaders steeped in fear and opposite ideologies and not compassion. This is heart-wrenchingly clear as we mourn the deaths of Officer Ramos and Liu at the hands of an angry, ill and hurting Ismaayil Brinsley. And the pain continues as Pataki attacks de Blasio and the Patrick Lynch coerces officers to turn their backs on our mayor. 
This fighting is not new and was also painfully clear to me as I wrestled with a passage from Joshua. 
Joshua 5:13-14, says ""when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and he saw a man with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, ""are you for us or for our enemies."" He responded, ""Neither, but as the commander of the army of the Lord I have now come."" Joshua then fell facedown to the ground in reverence and asked him, ""whatmessage does my Lord have for His servant.""
First, I am bewildered by Joshua's reaction to meeting the Commanders of the Army of the Lord - who some commentaries say is Jesus.
He stops, worships and then asks His Master, what would you have me to do?
When I found out about the Eric Garner decision, I did not know how to respond. But my first instinct was not to stop. It was to go and do something. And I surely didn't pause to find my favorite worship song or let alone ask, ""Lord, what would you have me to do?""
But what if that was our first response!?!? And, we stopped, worshiped, waited for God to speak AND then did what He said. 
Stop. 
Worship! 
Ask God what to do.
Wait for Him to respond.
Do what He says. 
What if that was our posture towards the next Michael Brown and Darren Wilson? What if instead of drawing battle lines to protect MY money, MY comfort, MY stuff, MY time, MY pride or whatever illusion of possessiveness we have chosen to believe our response was praise to Our Good, Righteous, Just and Mighty God? What if we stopped to worship the God of the Bible who is Our Rock, Salvation, Provider and Sovereign King? The God who split open the Red Sea, turned water into wine and touched lepers to make them clean. What if we put down the god of prosperity and personal wealth that we have made for ourselves and picked up the Cross of Christ and embraced Him as Lord, Savior and Friend?
And then we asked, ""Lord, I am your servant, what would you have me do?"" And then, we waited.
What if we held our suggestions, thoughts and comments back and waited? And we didn't wait for just a day or just one quiet time? What if we didn't just wait for our three day fast or until the end of Lent? No, what if we waited until we heard from the commander of the Lord's Army?
And then -- we did what He said! What if we didn't compromise, edit, accommodate or just make it a little more convenient? 
Joshua did this! He heard from God and went to the great walled city, Jericho. Without a bullet or a bomb, or even a push, those famous walls came crashing down. To some, Joshua's commands probably made no sense. Marching around a wall seven times probably seemed preposterous. And the trumpets were not part of any battle plan that the soldiers envisioned. But because Joshua worshiped, waited, listened to God and obeyed - the city was given over to the Israelites. 
The second element that stood out to me was one word, neither. Joshua asked the Commander of the Lord's Army, ""Are you for us, or for our enemies? and""neither"" was the first word of His answer. 
""Are you for the police or for the protesters?"" 
""Do you think the NYPD is racist or not?""
""Michael Brown was a robber, he's in hell. Right?""
""Do you think white privilege is real or not? 
We live in a land of black and white, where lines are drawn in the sand by people in chains that still hold hands, hearts, minds and an entire country to a fencepost of pride in ourselves at the expense of the other. 
Caught up in the false dichotomies we wage war against our brothers and sisters. Our country is bleeding out on the bathroom floor of the world, numb to the pain of one another.   I believe we must be willing to be ""Neither"". We must be FOR the Kingdom of God and the flourishing of all creation. We must be FOR justice for all and against justice for some, because that it no justice at all.  As I marched with thousands of protesters out of Washington Square Park, I stood and stepped solely for His Kingdom and His Glory as our small band prayed before the protest.
Racist is not spelled N-Y-P-D. 
Black American males are not ""thugs"". 
Police officers are not ""pigs"". 
Michael Brown and Eric Garner were not demons and neither ""got what was coming to them"". 
George Zimmerman, Darren Wilson, and Daniel Palenteo are not white devils. 
White privilege and systemic racism are alive and well; and so is personal accountability for our actions. 
All of these persons are made in the image of God with the mandate to flourish, work, rule and create and ensure the same for all other people and creation. That is true for Darren Wilson and his new wife. And that's also true for Eric Garner's widow and his 6 children. The kingdom of God is big enough for both of them, yet it seems our sound bites, soap boxes, and pundit booths are not.
God help us to grow up to become people willing to stand with the protesters and enter into the complexity of their struggle with grief, humility, compassion, patience and sacrificial love.
AND to be people who stand with the police and the powerful and enter into the complexity of their pain with grief, humility, compassion, patience and sacrificial love. 
Would God make us people like Joshua and shape us into people who have the character and capacity to respond ""neither"" in the face of such division, strife and turmoil because we know who we are, who Our God is, and the Gospel He has entrusted us with. 
I close with this prayer. Father, forgive us for not stopping to worship before we jumped onto our bandwagons and off of yours. Forgive us for going on Facebook and Twitter to respond to the injustices around us before consulting with You, our commander so that we had something nourishing to share. Forgive us for protesting and counter-protesting before meeting with You. Forgive us for taking Yourname in vain and using our privilege, power and authority to destroy, denigrate, discourage and condemn. Help us to stop and stand in awe of Your Goodness so that this world can be put into perspective and we might see ourselves and all people as You see them. Help us to wait for Yourclear direction, however long that may be. And help us to obey Your command to love our neighbors as ourselves in the way that You command. We ask these things in the strong, beautiful, freeing name of Jesus. Amen!

158,RELIGION,Trump Should Not Encourage Politics In Church,"Celia Wexler, ContributorCatholic feminist, journalist, former public interest lobbyist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-should-not-encourag_b_13392982.html,"Frank discussion is good for the church. But not when disagreement descends into something mean and nasty, as it often does in the political realm. That's what makes one of President-elect Donald Trump's pledges so upsetting to me.",2016-12-03,RELIGION,"In previous columns, I've made clear when I disagree with Pope Francis. But the pope was absolutely right when he called out the ""virus of polarization and animosity"" that is beginning to permeate the church. ""Little by little,"" the Pope told 17 new Cardinals on November 26, ""our differences turn into symptoms of hostility, threats and violence."" 
The Pope recognizes that people of good will can disagree, that in our efforts to address the world's problems, we can come up with different solutions. But he cautions us not to take those disagreements into the realm of judgement, where we believe ourselves the ""good guys"" and demonize those who disagree.
Frank discussion is good for the church. But not when disagreement descends into something mean and nasty, as it often does in the political realm.
That's what makes one of President-elect Donald Trump's pledges so upsetting to me. He would throw all restraints off churches from engaging in full-throated political activism. As a Catholic, I don't want to belong to a church riven with political dissension. 
During the Republican National Convention, Trump promised to repeal the Johnson amendment. The amendment, quietly tucked into the Revenue Act of 1954 by then-Senator Lyndon Johnson, barred churches and other tax-exempt charitable groups from engaging in partisan political activities. 
Partisan activity jeopardizes two big benefits churches - and other charitable organizations receive - exemption from paying federal corporate and income taxes, and the ability to raise contributions that the donors can deduct from their federal taxes. 
For more than half a century, the Johnson amendment has restrained churches, including mine, from issuing partisan calls to action from the pulpit. It also has meant that the contributions I make to my church are not going to be used to elect political candidates or support political parties I oppose.
  The faith we celebrate when we come together in prayer ideally will help us treat everyone we encounter in our workaday world with empathy and respect, even when it's hard to see beyond their party preferences.   
The Johnson amendment isn't perfect. A lot of churches get away with a lot of partisan activity without the Internal Revenue Service levying any penalties. Nevertheless, it has been a good way to moderate what religious leaders do in public. 
If we remove these restraints, I worry what will happen. As a Catholic, I am aware that U.S. bishops often take positions that differ greatly from the views of the Catholic laity. For example, while U.S. bishops consistently support a legal ban on abortions, roughly half of all Catholics express support for keeping abortion legal. Surveys have shown that Catholics in the pews have far more tolerance for gay marriage, couples living together, and birth control than church leaders. 
Hillary Clinton lost the Catholic vote in 2016. But Catholics supported President Obama. The Catholic vote in 2012 is particularly telling, given that by then, the U.S. bishops had been engaged in a lengthy legal battle over the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act. 
Certainly the Johnson amendment hasn't stopped bishops from hinting very broadly about their political preferences. But Catholics don't usually get threatened with hell fire if their votes don't reflect the bishops' public policy views.
And the Johnson amendment has never prevented any church from getting involved in policy fights over specific issues such as abortion, contraception, gay marriage, immigration or our obligation to help those in poverty. 
But to bring partisan politics directly into our houses of worship seems like a terrible idea. Right now, by and large, when I attend Mass, I leave my politics at the door. What would happen if our pastors started taking sides in elections and using the pulpit to do it?
Yes, there are churches where overwhelming majorities of members lean towards either the Republican or Democratic parties. But scores of religious denominations, including Catholicism, include members with varying political views. 
In my parish, I know I am worshiping with people with political beliefs that disagree with mine. Part of my faith experience is meeting my fellow Catholics in a ritual that transcends politics. We all need love, forgiveness and tolerance. The faith we celebrate when we come together in prayer ideally will help us treat everyone we encounter in our workaday world with empathy and respect, even when it's hard to see beyond their party preferences.

The decision comes while Team USA’s governing body continues to face sharp questions over patterns of sexual abuse uncovered throughout the U.S. Olympic program. 
USOC said the move was made out of consideration for Blackmun’s health. He is currently being treated for prostate cancer.
“Given Scott’s current health situation, we have mutually agreed it is in the best interest of both Scott and the USOC that we identify new leadership so that we can immediately address the urgent initiatives ahead of us,” USOC Chairman Larry Probst said in a statement provided to HuffPost.
Current board member Susanne Lyons will oversee day-to-day operations while a search is conducted for Blackmun’s replacement. The group is continuing to evaluate what steps it can take to prevent abuse of its athletes and said it intends to form an advisory committee of abuse survivors and advocates. 
Observers have been particularly critical of the USOC’s relationship with former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar, who was handed a prison sentence of at least 40 years in January for serial sexual misconduct. In the wake of the scandal, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) called for Blackmun’s resignation. Other Olympic groups, including USA Swimming, had also called for him and other USOC leaders to step down.
“The USOC is at a critical point in its history,” Probst said. “The important work that Scott started needs to continue and will require especially vigorous attention in light of Larry Nassar’s decades-long abuse of athletes affiliated with USA Gymnastics. We will be working with key stakeholders to help identify a permanent successor to Scott. In the meantime, I am confident that Susanne is the right person to help us navigate this critical transition period.”
Blackmun had earned praise for his efforts to repair relations between the USOC and the International Olympic Committee.
“Serving the USOC and its many stakeholders and working with our board, our professional staff and many others who support the Olympic and Paralympic movements has not only been immensely rewarding, it has been an honor and the highlight of my professional life,” Blackmun said in a statement.
California attorney Robert Allard, who represents USA Swimming abuse survivors, said in a statement Wednesday that Blackmum’s departure would be good for the USOC.
“Scott Blackmun refused to protect athletes from predator coaches even though he knew for decades that sexual abuse was a major problem with USOC National Governing Bodies,” Allard said. “His legacy, along with USA Swimming CEO Chuck Wielgus, will be that of a sexual abuse enabler. Moving forward, the culture that allowed sexual abuse to fester and thrive under Blackmun must be destroyed. We will not rest until all of those that have been part of the childhood sexual abuse problem for decades are removed from the USOC and its National Governing Bodies. Only then will young athletes truly be safe. With Blackmun now gone, it is imperative that the USOC put someone in charge who places the safety and welfare of athletes as its top priority.”

The NFL Network suspended Faulk, a retired running back who is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and fellow analysts Heath Evans and Ike Taylor after the allegations surfaced, spokesman Alex Riethmiller confirmed to HuffPost in an email. Evans and Taylor also are former players.
McNabb and Davis, who used to work for the NFL Network, were suspended by ESPN, their current employer. Sapp hasn’t worked for the NFL Network since 2015, when he was fired after being arrested for allegedly soliciting a prostitute. Those charges were later dropped.
The sexual misconduct allegations against the ex-players were detailed in an amended lawsuit filed in Los Angeles on Monday by Jami Cantor, a former wardrobe stylist at the NFL Network
In the complaint, first reported by Bloomberg News, Cantor accused Faulk of fondling her breasts and exposing his penis as he demanded oral sex. She said that Evans, a former fullback, sent nude pictures and made unwelcome propositions, and that Taylor, an ex-defensive back, sent her a video of him masturbating in the shower.
“The supervisors knew about it, the supervisors observed it,” Cantor’s lawyer, Laura Horton, said, according to The New York Times. “It was insidious in this particular environment.”
She alleged another man, former NFL Network executive Eric Weinberger, groped her and pushed his genitals against her. Weinberger has been suspended by his current company, The Ringer.
The suit alleges McNabb, a longtime NFL quarterback, sent her lewd messages and that Davis, who played 13 seasons in the NFL as a defensive back, groped her. Both men most recently have been hosting radio shows for ESPN.
Sapp, according to the suit, gave Cantor sex toys as Christmas gifts three years in a row and showed her nude photos of other women with whom he claimed to have had sexual relations. He also is in the NFL Hall of Fame.
Cantor asserts that she was wrongfully terminated by the NFL Network, where she worked 10 years until her dismissal for allegedly stealing in 2016. Cantor, then 51, said she complained about the working conditions to no avail and was replaced by a woman 21 years younger than her.
Cantor originally filed her suit in October.

“I have difficulties to hold back my tears,” Elistratov said at a press conference following his third-place finish in the men’s 1500m short track speed skating event on Saturday, according to The Guardian. “I am incredibly happy that I did it, in spite of all the circumstances around Russian sport. I dedicate this medal to all guys that have been excluded from these Games in such a hard and unfair way. This medal is for you.”
The BBC reported that the IOC ― which banned Russia from competing at the Winter Olympics over its state-backed doping program ― was investigating Elistratov’s comments because of their apparently political nature. As one of the athletes competing at Pyeongchang under the banner of the Olympic Athletes from Russia team, Elistatrov must follow strict IOC guidelines, including not wearing his country’s colors and refraining from “any public form of publicity, activity and communication associated with the national flag, anthem, emblem and symbol.”
“We have a surveillance program looking at the action and behavior of the OAR team and they will report back at the end of the Games to the executive board to see if not just the letter but the spirit of the law has been breached,” IOC spokesman Mark Adams told the BBC. “It’s for that expert team to look at it.”
As CNN noted, Elistratov was suspended from skating in 2016 after the banned heart drug meldonium was found in his system. He was later granted amnesty by the World Anti-Doping Agency, which determined that low concentrations of the drug found in samples before March 1, 2016, were acceptable.

What if the media provided honest, often outspoken, and comprehensive commentary about our wars, coverage that lasted for months and months, featuring clear-eyed metrics based on relentless analysis? I know ― dream on.
If you’re not familiar with NFL football or ESPN coverage of the same, you should be, because it says much about the American moment. The first round of the draft kicks off on Thursday night in prime time, followed by the second and third rounds on Friday night in prime time. The draft concludes on Saturday with rounds four through seven, roughly 250 total picks.
Yet this quick summary vastly understates the coverage devoted to the draft. From the end of the Super Bowl early in February to the draft itself at the end of April, coverage of the draft on ESPN is virtually non-stop, with innumerable “mock” drafts for each team and a parade of “experts” speculating about the prospects of each player and team. Exhaustive (and exhausting) is the word to describe this coverage.
When Round One finally kicks off, it’s essentially a parade of soon-to-be millionaires. These players, selected from various college football teams, can count on multi-year contracts and signing bonuses in the millions of dollars. ESPN and the NFL stage-manages the selection process, turning it into an extravaganza complete with musicians, cheering (or booing) fans, and plenty of past NFL greats, along with the draftees and their families and friends. Coverage includes shots of the “war rooms” of the various NFL teams as they decide which players to pick, which draft picks to trade, and so on.
The war room — isn’t that a telling phrase?
Indeed, let’s push that further. Most red-blooded NFL fans would be hard-pressed to find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map, but they can tell you about their team’s draft picks, rattling off statistics such as times in the 40-yard dash, vertical leap, even the size of a player’s hands (considered especially pertinent if he’s a quarterback or wide receiver). What astonishes me is the sheer wealth of detail gathered about each player, the human intelligence (or HUMINT in military terms). Players, especially those projected to go in the first few rounds, are scrutinized from every angle: physical, mental, emotional, you name it.
With millions of dollars at stake, such an exhaustive approach is not terribly surprising. Yet even with a wealth of data, each year there are major draft busts (e.g. Ryan Leaf, a quarterback selected #2 overall in the first round and a flop) and major surprises (e.g. Tom Brady, a quarterback selected late in the 6th round as the 199th pick, meaning not much was expected from him, after which he won five Super Bowls). Results from the NFL draft should teach us something about the limits of data-driven “intelligence” in wars, yet our nation’s intelligence agencies (17 of them!) continue to believe they can quantify, predict, and control events in places we and they know little about.
But again what wows me is the thoroughness as well as the slickness of ESPN’s coverage of the draft. When a player is selected, ESPN instantly has video of his college highlights, together with his vital statistics (height, weight, performance at the draft combine in various drills, and so on). Video and stats are backed by interviews with a draftee’s previous coaches, who extol his virtues, along with interviews with those “war rooms” again as to why they decided to draft that player and not another. Once the draft is completed, teams are then awarded “grades” by various commentators, even though these players have yet to play a snap in the NFL. (Imagine if your kid received an instant grade in college — before he attended a single class or completed a single assignment — based upon his performance in high school.)
You have to hand it to ESPN: their coverage of the draft is an exercise in total information awareness. It’s blanket coverage, an exercise in full-spectrum dominance. It’s slick, professional, and driven by a tireless pursuit of victory by each team (and a relentless pursuit of ratings by ESPN).
So, a modest proposal: To win the war on terror, let’s put ESPN in charge of it. I know: It’s a frivolous suggestion to treat war like a sport. But is it? After all, America currently treats the NFL draft with all the seriousness of a life-and-death struggle, even as it treats its wars with comparative frivolity. Small wonder America continues to lose its wars while fielding some winning NFL teams.

When the Steelers linebacker and fellow NFL players Clay Matthews and Julius Peppers were cleared of wrongdoing by the league Wednesday after an Al Jazeera documentary linked them to performance-enhancing drugs, Harrison posted an Instagram collage of headlines declaring his innocence.
“It’s only breaking news cause you thought I was guilty,” he wrote. “I have my father’s name and I have WORKED for EVERYTHING I have since DAY ONE.”
The NFL said in a statement it had found “no credible evidence” that the players used drugs prohibited by the league, Reuters reported.
The three players, who were threatened with suspension if they did not meet with investigators, were interviewed by the league last week about the doping allegations included in the documentary. In the film, a pharmacist claimed to have supplied steroids to the players, but publicly recanted his statements.
The now-retired Peyton Manning was cleared in July by the NFL in an announcement that was met with some skepticism.

United to Montreal and Philadelphia, it was the turn of Bastian Schweinsteiger and the Chicago Fire to roll into town. After failing to score in their last two games, and with Luis Acosta suspended after his sending off the previous week, United went with both Patrick Mullins and Sebastien Le Toux up front for the first time. It didn’t make a difference, as United, once again, failed to score.
The first half of the game was full of end to end attacking
...with neither side managing to secure an advantage, and Schweinsteiger showing that he’s still more than good enough to play top level football.
Bill Hamid, in the United goal, was called upon on several occasions to keep the ball out of the back of the net.
United continued to press, in their best half of this three-game home stand.
...while throwing themselves into tackles to prevent Chicago from scoring.
But the same was true at the other end, with Chicago’s defense holding strong...
...and Schweinsteiger doing what he does best.
While Dax McCarty continued to show why the Red Bulls shouldn’t have traded him.
Which meant that Hamid was called upon again... 
...and again.
...as Chicago went closer and closer.
...but still Hamid stood strong.
United did have their chances too, but nothing that challenged Matt Lampson in Chicago’s goal.
As the half wore down, Hamid made another save, to keep the score at 0-0.
When the second half started, it was Chicago that started out the more livelier of the teams... 
...and in the 52nd minute David Accam slid the ball past Hamid to give Chicago a lead they’d not relinquish... 
...which he celebrated by leaping at, and kicking the corner flag.
This spurred United on to attack... through Le Toux... 
...Lloyd Sam... 
...and Marcelo.
...but none of the three managed a shot on goal, despite these attacks.
United defender, Steve Birnbaum, did manage to actually get the ball on target, but the ball was saved by Lampson.
Chicago weren’t idle, they continued to attack, in some cases breaking away after a United attack, but they were unable to extend their lead.
United’s continued to press forward, but Chicago’s defense held strong...
...not allowing United access to shooting lanes.
Even Sam’s Karate kid impression was to no avail
...and while substitute Jose Guillermo Ortiz managed a shot on goal, the equalizer was not forthcoming, and Chicago took the 3 points, while United managed 0 points from their 3 home games, scoring 0 goals, with 6 against.

But he would still like one last shot in the NFL anyway. 
“I want to hang them up on the field,"" Rice told ESPN’s Jemele Hill. ""I just want to hang them up the right way.”
Rice told Hill that he has come a long way since video emerged last September of Rice knocking out his then-fiancee, which he called “the worst decision I’ve ever made in my life."" Rice also admitted that at one point after the video was released he ""actually felt what it felt like to feel like it wasn't worth living.”
Rice said he ""can understand why some people will never forgive"" him, but hopes to use his position to advocate for survivors of domestic abuse. “I have to go out there and help people,” Rice said. “I have to help [people] understand that domestic violence … of any kind is not allowed.”
“To the survivors of domestic violence, I understand how real it is and I don’t want to ever take that for granted because it’s a real issue in our society,” he added.
Rice has been eligible to sign with an NFL team since he won an appeal of his indefinite suspension late last year, but he remains unsigned. Rice has worked extensively since his suspension to rehabilitate his image, speaking at both the college he attended and his former high school about what he has learned through his experience. 
“I understand that being an NFL player is a huge, huge responsibility,” Rice said. “We should as professional athletes hold ourselves to a higher standard.”
One of the anti-domestic violence organizations with which Rice has closely worked stated in an interview with ESPN’s Adam Schefter last week that Rice deserved a second chance in the league. But the organization, A Call To Men, then retracted the endorsement just days later and apologized for recommending an NFL team sign Rice before talking with the larger anti-domestic violence community. 
Rice said his biggest regret is leaving his wife on the elevator floor. “I didn’t help my wife up. I did everything wrong … I was out of my mind,"" he said. ""How could you not help her up in that moment? That’s the part that I wrestle with today.”
 A recent HuffPost/YouGov poll found that Americans are split overall on whether Rice is deserving of a second chance in the NFL. Men and self-professed footballs fans, however, are generally in favor another shot. Women are much less likely to feel the same way.
“My wife and my kids believe in me so they're pushing me harder sometimes than I can push myself,"" Rice said. ""I’m just really hopeful for a second chance.”

171,SPORTS,Odell Beckham Jr. Has Reached The Tipping Point,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/odell-beckham-jr-tipping-point_us_57f3c8ece4b0d0e1a9a9cbad,"There is a fine line between passion and overzealousness, and Beckham has been toeing it all year.",2016-10-04,SPORTS,"The NFL has often been called the grown man’s league. Good players ― great ones, even ― see their will tested every Sunday. Mental toughness is often more important than physical ability. And in the case of Odell Beckham Jr., we are finding out exactly why.
In Beckham’s first two professional seasons with the New York Giants, it all came too easily. He burst onto the scene with that gravity-defying catch against archrival Dallas on “Sunday Night Football,” and went on to become a weekly one-man highlight reel for an otherwise hapless Giants team.
In just 12 games as a rookie, the first-round pick from LSU amassed over 1,300 yards and 12 touchdowns while earning Offensive Rookie of the Year honors. Then, last season, Beckham’s numbers improved across the board and he was recognized as a second-team All-Pro. In fact, no receiver in league history ― not even the spectacular Jerry Rice ― totaled more receiving yards through his first two seasons. Just last year, Beckham had 1,450 yards, while the rest of the Giant receivers had 1,405 combined.
Naturally, 2016 was supposed to be yet another one for the record books for Beckham, with the Giants drafting Sterling Shepard to help No. 13 shoulder the load.
At the quarter pole of the 2016 season, however, the 2-2 Giants have looked mostly anemic offensively, and Beckham has had a measly 22 catches for 303 yards and zero touchdowns ― the worst four-game stretch of his young career. He hasn’t found the end zone since Dec. 20, 2015. That’s five straight games played for Beckham without a touchdown, the longest streak of his career. In fact, prior to this stretch he had gone two games without a touchdown only once.
But arguably more concerning is his behavior on the field and the sidelines. Long praised for his fiery personality, the mercurial Beckham has become a distraction.
During a 24-10 Monday night loss to the Vikings ― a game in which he had a career-low 23 yards receiving ― he once again let his emotions get the best of him. Going back and forth with cornerback Xavier Rhodes, Beckham was hit with yet another unsportsmanlike penalty, an all too familiar pattern.
“Nobody on another team bothers, upsets me,” he told reporters after the game.
Of course, when we watch Beckham play, that hardly seems to be the case. Perhaps it all started during last year’s on-field debacle with then-Carolina Panthers All-Pro cornerback Josh Norman. Beckham was suspended for one game (thus ending the Giants’ playoff hopes) and the controversy spilled over into the offseason.
“He has got to be aware,” quarterback Eli Manning said. “They’re looking for him, and he has got to play smart. We can’t afford to do anything. They’re going to call him, and he brought that on himself.”
The hardest part when evaluating the 23-year-old Beckham is that he’s just so damn talented and passionate. You throw in his admirable work ethic, and there is no question that he can ― that he should ― go down as one of the all-time greats. 
While we can certainly make the argument that referees aren’t treating him fairly, we must also note that he isn’t exactly giving them a choice, either.
There is a fine line between passion and overzealousness and Beckham has been toeing it all year. He talked incessantly about how “it is what it is” following Monday’s game. The harsh reality, though, is that “it is what it is” only because of Beckham’s petulant actions.
“I just have to understand if I sneeze the wrong way, it’ll be a flag, it’ll be a fine,” Beckham said. “If I tie my shoe the wrong way, it might be a fine or a flag.”
At their core, these statements sound like denial and stupidity from a player widely recognized as a thoughtful and brilliant young man. Surely, Monday night will not be the last time players attempt to throw Beckham off by baiting him and trying to get him thinking about anything but football. And surely the referees will keep an eye out for any little misstep he might make. 
Beckham needs to understand that he’s too talented and too valuable to continually fall into this trap: Causing brawls, as he did against the Rams in 2014. Fighting kicking nets, as he did last week. Getting suspended with the season hanging in the balance.
Go back and look at the recent history of the truly great wide receivers in this league. Plenty of them were known hotheads with questionable on-field antics ― think Randy Moss, Michael Irvin, Terrell Owens ― and yet for the most part they were able to put aside the emotional outbursts and play great football. 
It’s time for Beckham to take accountability and turn this thing around before it spirals completely out of control.

I can't think of anyone, really. I am troubled by the notion that since we've discovered cloning, we perhaps could or should try cloning someone. A person is a result of a life lived with other people at a certain time in history. It's not a reproducible product. 
Cloning a person is a bad idea, because the offspring would be one evolutionary step behind his or her contemporaries. The key feature of sexual reproduction is that we get an offspring that is inherently different from the parents. Germs and parasites, which (or who) reproduce at extraordinary speeds, can't quite deal with the new mixture of genes. My O my…
3. Imagine there's an open seat on the first mission to send humans to Mars. Would you sign up? It would depend on who's mounting the mission. A few of the proposals of late seem underfunded, to put it generously, and just unrealistic.

4. If time travel were possible, what day/era would you want to get to? Why? What would you do? Whom would you meet?  I'd go for 250 years from now, after steps have been taken to address climate change and the world's human population has stabilized. I think my English would be intelligible that many years hence. I'd like to meet the human woman with the best smile and the best sense of humor on Earth. I claim that to have a good sense of humor, one has to be smart. A man can dream.
5. If you could be any animal but a human, which animal would you be and why? A well cared for dog.
6. If scientists were to create a real-life ""invisibility cloak,"" how would you use it? I'd disrupt climate change denier meetings.
7. Would sex with a robot be cheating? In my view, we have sex robots already. Sex toys or ""marital aids"" are sold by the millions, to a large extent, as a substitute for cheating.

When a probe passes near,2013-07-21,TECH & SCIENCE,"Ever wonder if aliens have been spying on us? You're not alone. In a provocative new paper, a pair of astrophysicists consider the possibility that intelligent alien beings could have built a fleet of self-replicating space probes that use gravity to sling themselves from star to star.
""We're saying that if aliens build self-replicating probes, they could explore the entire Milky Way in about ten million years,"" study co-author Dr. Duncan Forgan, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Edinburgh’s Institute for Astronomy, told The Huffington Post in an email. 
Ten million years is a relatively short timespan, given that scientists estimate the universe is around 13.8 billion years old.
How could such probes make copies of themselves? Dr. Duncan said that we humans seem to be closing in on the necessary technology ourselves, and ""with current 3D printing tech, it might only be a century or two before humans figure it out!"" 
Travel by slingshot effect -- also called gravity assist -- isn't as wacky as it sounds either. When a probe passes near a planet, it can get a boost in speed from the planet's gravity. NASA has exploited the phenomenon on many occasions--perhaps most notably with the Voyager I and II space probes. Launched in 1977, the probes used gravity assist to reach the edge of our solar system.
Alien probes using the same slingshot maneuvers wouldn't have to depend on powerful engines or massive amounts of fuel. And they could explore the galaxy 100 times faster than probes navigated by powered flight, Dr. Duncan said.
The paper, entitled ""Slingshot Dynamics for Self-Replicating Probes and the Effect on Exploration Timescales,"" was published in the International Journal of Astrobiology.

 The impact of comets crashing into Earth's surface may have provided the energy to create simple molecules that formed the precursors to life, a new study suggests.
 That conclusion, published in the June 20 issue of the Journal of Physical Chemistry A, was based on a computer model of such an impact's effect on a comet crystal initially made up of water, carbon dioxide and other simple molecules.
 ""Comets carry very simple molecules in them,"" said study co-author Nir Goldman, a physical chemist at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California. ""When a comet hits a planetary surface, for example, that impact can drive the synthesis of more complicated things that are prebiotic — they're life-building.""
 Comet collision
 The notion that life-building molecules were carried to Earth via comets or asteroids, a hypothesis known as panspermia, has been around for decades. But the idea that the comet impact itself could have created the molecules is newer.
 When the Earth was young, comet bombardments may have brought 22 trillion pounds (10 trillion kilograms) of carbon-based material to the planet every year, Goldman said. That would have provided a rich source for the building blocks of life to form. In a separate recent study, scientists zapped a mini-comet in the lab to prove that precursor molecules could form far from Earth. [7 Theories on the Origin of Life]
 To test their hypothesis, Goldman and his colleagues used a computer model to simulate a single comet crystal of hundreds of molecules. Comets are mostly ""dirty snowballs,"" Goldman said, so the simulated crystal started with mostly water molecules, but also included methanol, ammonia, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.
 The researchers then simulated the effects of the crystal hitting the Earth's surface at various angles, from crashing into it directly to making a glancing blow. They followed the chemical changes in the crystal for about 250 picoseconds, about the amount of time the system needed to reach a steady state, where the proportion and type of chemicals in the system is stable. The huge jolt from the impact provided the energy needed to make complicated chemicals.
 ""Certain conditions were a sweet spot for complexity,"" Goldman told LiveScience.
 For instance, at pressures of about 360,000 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level and temperatures of 4,600 degrees Fahrenheit (2,538 degrees Celsius), the molecules in the crystals formed complex species called aromatic rings. These types of circular, carbon-based molecules could have been precursors to the letters in DNA.
 At higher pressures, the molecules produced methane, formaldehyde and some long-chain carbon molecules.
 ""Every time there was an impact hard enough to get chemical reactivity, it produced interesting stuff,"" Goldman said.
 As a follow-up, Goldman and his colleagues want to test different initial chemical concentrations in the comet to see how that affects the formation process.
 No way to prove
 The findings are fascinating, said Ralf Kaiser, a physical chemist who studies astrochemistry at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
 ""It opens another pathway to explain how these biological, or precursor molecules can be formed,"" Kaiser, who was not involved in the study, told LiveScience.
 The team has shown that such precursor molecules ""absolutely could be formed this way, no question,"" Kaiser said.
 But it's not all or nothing: Some molecules could have been carried here by comets from outer space, while some formed on impact, and still others formed completely from home-grown materials. The tricky question is to determine what percentage of life's building blocks arose during each process, Kaiser said.

Mathematicians sometimes",2014-02-17,TECH & SCIENCE,"What's beautiful to you? A sunset? The face of a loved one? A favorite poem or song? 
Mathematicians sometimes say they find beauty in mathematical formulas, and a new brain scan study confirms that equations can activate the brain in much the same way that great art does.
""To many of us, mathematical formulae appear dry and inaccessible, but to a mathematician an equation can embody the quintessence of beauty,"" study author Dr. Semir Zeki, professor of neuroesthetics at University College London, said in a written statement. ""The beauty of a formula may result from simplicity, symmetry, elegance or the expression of an immutable truth.""
For the study, which was published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, Zeki and his colleagues recruited from local colleges 16 male and female mathematicians between the ages of 22 and 32. The mathematicians were asked to review 60 mathematical formulas and to rate them on a scale ranging from minus five (ugly) to plus five (beautiful). Two weeks later they re-rated the equations while in a functional MRI (fMRI) scanner.
fMRI scanners show neurological activity by measuring changes in the flow of blood inside the brain. The scans in the study showed that appreciating beautiful formulas is correlated with activity in the medial orbito-frontal cortex, a region at the front of the brain. Appreciating art or music is correlated with activity in that same region.
Srinivasa Ramanujan's infinite series (below) and Riemann's functional equation didn't fare well in the study. They were rated ugliest.
 Srinivasa Ramanujan’s infinite series of 1/pi, which was rated as the ugliest mathematical formula.
Which of the 60 math formulas were rated as especially beautiful? There were three: the Pythagorean identity, the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and Leonhard Euler's identity (see above, top).
""It's a real classic, and you can do no better than that,"" Dr. David Percy, a professor affiliated with the Institute of Mathematics and Its Applications in the U.K., told the BBC about Euler's identity. ""It is simple to look at and yet incredibly profound, it comprises the five most important mathematical constants... It also comprises the three most basic arithmetic operations--addition, multiplication, and exponentiation.""
Dr. Steven Strogatz, professor of applied mathematics at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, offered a different take on the new research. ""Some beautiful equations are like art, but others are more like great jokes,"" he told The Huffington Post in an email. ""They're surprising and true at the same time. That's what makes them so delightful.""

It may go into remission and come back later. Fortunately, the California stem cell program is pretty tough too.",2014-01-25,TECH & SCIENCE,"""Scoot your bottom over,"" said the nurse as I lay on my side in the backless hospital gown.
I felt a sudden inclination to resist. Maybe if I just said no, got up and put my clothes on, I could walk out of there, and life would go back to normal.
But the moment passed. I did as requested, and the Roto-Rooter sample takers invaded, taking 12 little chunks out of me. If that sounds gross and terrifying (and mildly painful), you have an accurate assessment of the situation.
The test results came back, and an appointment was set up -- immediately.
""You have cancer,"" the doctor said by way of greeting.
Since an estimated 90 percent of all males get prostate cancer if they live long enough, I was not immediately concerned. But when he mentioned some actual numbers, he had my undivided attention.
This year, roughly 240,000 male Americans will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 30,000 will die of it.
Because prostate cancer is generally slow-growing, many don't know they have it, and they die of old age; the cancer was there, but it just did not give them problems.
But for some, the cancer must be dealt with. One important measuring device is called the Gleason score, which ranges from 1 (no problem) to 10 (the worst).
With my score of 7, some form of action was required. Options included surgery to remove the offending prostate gland, or radiation, hormone therapy, or possibly even chemotherapy, or some combination thereof. 
I went with the surgery, a ""radical prostatectomy,"" and a little robot did the cutting.
It was a nightmare with moments of comedy. My wedding ring had to come off before the surgery, and when I woke up, my first words came out in a squeaky Elmer Fudd ""you wascally wabbit"" kind of voice: ""Where is my wedding 'wing'?"" There were also some hopefully temporary side effects, like incontinence, etc.
When the prostate was dissected, it showed a more aggressive cancer than they'd hoped to find: On the Gleason scale it was an 8 instead of a 7.
Best-case scenario? Hopefully the cancer is gone, removed with the prostate gland. 
But if the cancer has spread, I will probably need radiation therapy. This is not fun: six weeks of daily sessions, with such possible side effects as rectal cancer.
If I need it, the highly targeted radiation should kill most of the cancer, maybe enough to keep me healthy for five, 10, 15 years or more. It's hard to tell. 
Cancer is tough to kill. It may go into remission and come back later.
Fortunately, the California stem cell program is pretty tough too. 
The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) has several projects that have suddenly become of great interest to me. 
One is pioneering Stanford scientist Dr. Irv Weissman's work, which I wrote about previously.
Another, led by Dr. Owen Witte of UCLA, involves signals that turn cancer on -- and, hopefully, off.
To say Witte is a qualified researcher is like saying Mount Everest is a decent-sized hill. The author or co-author of 363 published papers, Dr. Witte is the director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research.
If I were to list all his awards, accomplishments and responsibilities, there would be no room for the blog post. 
The research that may one day save lives or ease suffering? Let's take a look.
With a CIRM Basic Biology IV grant (#RB4-06209) of $1,254,960, Dr. Witte is studying the pathways of cancer.
Do you know how the male hippopotamus fights? The giant water mammals come up on dry land and charge each other on paths worn down by their bodies, crashing together. The winners get to mate, so they fight hard -- but they do not kill each other. When one loses, it just leaves the pathway.
Dr. Witte identified ""important signaling pathways that regulate (the) growth of normal prostate tissue stem cells ... Human cancers utilize these same pathways to promote malignancy and ... tumor progression.""
When cancer comes, it ""dysregulates"" the pathways.
How to stop the cancer and let the good stem cells control the pathways?
Our recent studies have uncovered an important ... molecule (Trop 2) that is expressed on ... prostate cancer cells ... [It] is selected for ... advanced disease and predicts poor prognosis for many tumors including prostate, ovarian, pancreatic, breast, gastric and colorectal cancer. 
Dr. Witte gave me a highly scientific explanation of how Trop 2 activates cancer, which I will share in a moment. 
But I understand it like a video game my granddaughter plays, which I call ""Fruits and Bombs."" On the screen pop up a bunch of watermelons, pineapples, grapes -- and cartoon bombs. You run your fingers across the screen, slashing the fruits, but if you touch a bomb, it explodes, and you lose.
For Trop 2 to activate the cancer, it has to be slashed (cleavage) by enzymes called proteases. If we can prevent the slashing, we might also block the cancer.
Now, for the scientists in the audience, here are Dr. Witte's words.
Trop 2 requires cleavage ... to activate its growth-promoting (including cancer-causing--DR) properties.Trop 2 is a molecule that crosses the cell membrane. ... To send its growth signal, a sequence of cuts have to be done on the molecule. These are carried out by enzymes called proteases. One is located outside the cell and it cuts first. Then a second protease cuts inside the cell and a fragment of the Trop 2 moves to the nucleus and signals for growth ... (personal communication)Our goal is to use very specific antibody molecules to block the first protease cleavage event on Trop 2 ...[Therefore] ... we are generating antibodies that will block Trop 2 activation ... We predict that blocking Trop 2 ... will be an effective strategy to prevent disease progression in prostate and other human cancers....
Dr. Witte points to the pressing need for better cancer treatments, saying: 
[Currently] advanced stages of prostate cancer are treated with hormonal therapy, which causes significant changes in mood, body weight and composition, impotence and gynecomastia [men growing breasts], in addition to the pain and suffering from the disease....
His goal? ""[T]o significantly extend life and minimize suffering of men with advanced prostate cancer."" 
And he adds, ""Many of the molecules that we are investigating are implicated in a range of tumors, suggesting that our findings may provide benefit to patients suffering from numerous cancers.""
With determination, intelligence, and passion, CIRM scientists like Owen Witte fight to solve diseases like prostate cancer -- which potentially threatens every male on the planet.
Is it any wonder I consider the California stem cell program to be the pride of our state, the glory of our nation, and a friend to all the world?

183,SCIENCE,How Mindfulness Is Revolutionizing Mental Health Care,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neuroscience-mindfulness_n_6531544.html,,2015-01-23,TECH & SCIENCE,"More than 350 million people globally suffer from depression, and 1 in 13 people around the world have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Overall, the World Health Organization estimates that roughly 450 million people suffer from some form of mental or neurological disorder -- and that roughly one in four people will be affected at some point in their lives. 
These numbers are staggering. With the rise of mental illness and the increasingly pressing need for effective treatments, there's never been a more important moment for mindfulness -- the ability to cultivate a focused, non-judgmental awareness on the present moment. Research has shown mindfulness and meditation-based programs to hold promise for treating a number of psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
As research has mounted in recent years, mindfulness has migrated from spiritual retreat centers to medical facilities. Now, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) -- the largest scientific organization in the world dedicated to research on the understanding and treatment of mental illness -- is getting serious about investigating mindfulness as a complementary treatment for a range of mental health conditions. 
On Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, University of Wisconsin neuroscientist Richard Davidson and NIMH director Tom Insel joined a conversation hosted by NPR science correspondent Joe Palca about how mindfulness affects the brain and might lead to improved clinical applications for the treatment of a range of mental health conditions.
So what exactly is mindfulness, and how can it improve psychological well-being? 
""Mindfulness is about being fully aware in the present moment,"" said Davidson. ""It's about bringing our attention back to the present moment and not getting carried away by our thoughts.""
Attention is highly trainable through various mindfulness practices like meditation, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), according to Davidson. ""We can actually educate our attention,"" he said. 
Mindfulness helps to train individuals in bringing back the attention time and time again when it has wandered. And it is precisely through helping individuals to not get carried away by their thoughts that mindfulness has been shown to be so effective for conditions like anxiety and depression. In fact, a landmark recent study  from researchers at Lund University showed a group mindfulness treatment to be as effective as traditional talk therapy for treating anxiety and depression. 
Evidence of the efficacy of these mindfulness-based treatments continues to grow. According to Insel, there are now nearly 500 scientific studies on mindfulness/meditation and the brain in the National Institute of Health's PubMed database. 
Mindfulness makes a whole lot of sense as a therapeutic intervention for these conditions. 
""When they're depressed, people are locked in the past. They're ruminating about something that happened that they can't let go of,"" said Insel. ""When they're anxious, they're ruminating about the future -- it's that anticipation of what they can't control."" 
In contrast, when we are mindful, we are focused on the here and now. Mindfulness trains individuals to turn their attention to what is happening in the present moment. 
On a neurological level, we're beginning to have a better understanding of the brain changes that underlie the improvements in psychological well-being and reduction of mental health symptoms that have been documented with mindfulness trainings.
Importantly, research has shown mindfulness to increase activity in brain areas associated with attention and emotion regulation. Mindfulness also facilitates neuroplasticity -- the creation of new connections and neural pathways in the brain.
""What we call meta-cognitive learning -- learning to watch your own mind and to be introspective in that sense -- does have an impact on brain pathways long-term,"" said Insel. 
This knowledge about the neurology of mindfulness could one day lead to improved clinical treatments. 
But it's important to note that the beneficial effects of mindfulness also extend to non-clinical populations. Anyone can stand to benefit from learning to cultivate a focused, non-judgmental awareness on the present moment -- particularly in our busy modern lifestyles that are often characterized by stress, sleep deprivation, multitasking and digital distractions. 
Mindfulness research pioneer and founder of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, Jon Kabat-Zinn, who was in the audience at Davos, stood up at the end of the conversation to share his thoughts on the mindful revolution in mental healthcare, which he noted has been well underway for several decades. As Kabat-Zinn explained, research and testimonials from patients and clinicians suggest that we can turn ""the medication down and the meditation up."" 
""We've seen this in the clinical domain for many years. People, in concert with their physicians... actually going off their medications for pain, for anxiety, for depression, as they begin to learn the self-regulatory elements of mindfulness,"" said Kabat-Zinn. ""They discover that the things that used to be symptomatically problematic for them are no longer arising at the same level.""

 A new fossil discovery reveals the duck-billed dinosaur Edmontosaurus regalis sported a fleshy comb on its head, similar to the ones on modern-day roosters. 
 A reconstruction of Edmontosaurus sporting a fleshy ""rooster"" comb.
No such comb has ever been discovered before on a dinosaur.
 ""We're never short of being surprised by what these animals looked like,"" said study researcher Phil Bell, a paleontologist at the University of New England in Australia. [Paleo-Art: Colorful Images Bring Dinosaurs to Life]
 Finding the fossil
 Duck-billed dinosaurs, or hadrosaurs, were large herbivores that filled the same ecological niche as deer or kangaroo today. In the past century, paleontologists have discovered several hadrosaur fossils with skin impressions pressed into the rock around the bones. These ""mummy"" specimens, so dubbed because they reveal more than just bone, show that hadrosaurs had pebbly skin not unlike that of today's crocodiles and birds.
 Edmontosaurus regalis, found fossilized in Alberta, Canada.
 But skin impressions rarely preserve well around the skull, Bell said.
 Bell's colleague, Federico Fanti, discovered the new E. regalis fossil in west central Alberta, about 45 miles (75 kilometers) from the town of Grande Prairie. They were surveying a well-known fossil site when Fanti noticed a string of vertebrae peeking out of a coffin-size boulder, Bell told LiveScience. The researchers had not found many bones still articulated in their original configurations, so they decided to collect the specimen.
 ""Because the block was too big to move on its own, we used a rock saw in an attempt to trim it down,"" Bell said. ""But no sooner did we start cutting into it than we found the first skin impression. We kind of had to bite the bullet and collect the whole block.""
 It was seven months before the team could get to the site with a truck and trailer, because the nearby Redwillow River was so high. But in 2011, the researchers drove a truck across the river, winched the boulder onto a trailer and brought it out of the field.
 While Bell was preparing the fossil, he discovered something even more amazing than skin impressions.
 ""Having a good idea of the outline of the animal, I put my chisel into the rock, not expecting to hit anything, and lo and behold, I realized I'd put my chisel straight through the middle of some skin impressions that shouldn't have been there,"" he said.
 Surprising skin 
 Bell had found a fleshy dome extending off of the duckbill's skull — something that had never been seen before. The dome included no bones and extended from the front of the eye sockets to the back of the head. It was almost 8 inches (20 centimeters) tall at its highest point and about 13 inches (33 cm) long.
 ""You can actually see the wrinkles in the skin that indicate that it had some flexibility to it,"" Bell said.
 Edmontosaurus skin impressions.
 In modern birds, such combs are typically used for sexual display. They're found in both sexes in birds, so the presence of the comb tells researchers nothing about their dinosaur specimen's sex. The bones they do have belong to the neck and head, and don't reveal sex either.
 ""What we need to find now are additional specimens that show this structure, and perhaps by comparing their sizes or relative development, we might get an idea of their sex,"" Bell said.
 It's not clear whether the comb is a feature only of E. regalis or if other duckbills might have had similar fleshy accessories. Skin associated with the head may not preserve well, meaning that other combs have vanished without a trace, Bell said. Or, they may have been overlooked. In the past, paleontologists considered skin impressions less interesting than bones, so they ignored them.
 ""People would actually remove and destroy the skin that's been preserved in order to get to the bones,"" Bell said.
 Modern preparation has the potential to lead to a deeper understanding of dinosaurs, he said. ""There's going to be no end of new and very surprising discoveries to come,"" Bell said.
 The researchers report their findings today (Dec. 12) in the journal Current Biology.

 Venus, Jupiter and the moon will gather together in the early morning sky Sunday (July 15), and provided the weather conditions cooperate, the celestial show will be well worth getting out of bed.
 Should weather conditions be favorable, set your alarm clock for around 4:30 a.m. local time on Sunday, and then proceed to a location where you will have a clear and unobstructed view of the east-northeast sky.
 Rather than partake in the usual ""inside-the-eyelid show"" at that somewhat ungodly hour, you can instead be rewarded with a view of a beautiful celestial gathering, as the slender crescent moon, just 13-percent illuminated, appears in close proximity to the two brightest planets in our sky. 
 Early risers who are up an hour or two before sunrise, and who are unaware or have no advance notice, will almost certainly wonder, as they cast a casual glance toward the skinny moon that morning, what those two ""large silvery stars"" happen to be. 
 Sometimes, such an occasion brings with it a sudden spike of phone calls to local planetariums, weather offices and even police precincts. Not a few of these calls excitedly inquire about ""the UFOs"" that are hovering close to our natural satellite.
 If bad weather or clouds spoil your view, you can also watch the planetary sky show online via live telescope views from the Slooh Space Camera website.
 All together again
 This cosmic scene between the two brightest planets and a crescent moon will be somewhat reminiscent of a similar three-way gathering that took place in the evening sky on the last weekend of February. 
 The brightest of the dynamic planetary duo that will keep company with the moon Sunday morning will be dazzling Venus, which has adorned the east-northeast twilight sky since it emerged into view following its rare transit of the sun in early June. [Bright Planets in Summer Sky Explained (Infographic)]
 No other star or planet in the night sky can come close to matching Venus in brilliance. Right now Venus is shining at its peak brilliance for its anticipated morning meet-up, and is more than 17 times brighter than Sirius, the brightest star in the sky. 
 This summer, Venus is the unrivaled morning star, and will soar from excellent to magnificent prominence in the east-northeast sky at dawn. The planet will be visible 2.5 hours before the sun rises on July 15, with that period growing to 3.5 hours by August 15.
 In fact, if the air is very clear and the sky is a good, deep blue, try looking for Venus shortly after sunrise. Once you know where to look, you should be able to see it in the daytime long after the sun has come up, appearing as a tiny white ""speck"" against the blue sky. 
 Meanwhile, Jupiter, dazzling in its own right, though just 1/9th as bright as Venus, is also becoming increasingly prominent in the morning sky, rising about 3.5 minutes earlier and climbing progressively higher each morning.
 On July 15 at sunrise, Jupiter will stand 35-degrees above the horizon. As a benchmark, 10 degrees can be visualized as roughly the equivalent of your clenched fist held at arm's length. By August 31, Jupiter will be twice as high, soaring more than three-quarters of the way up from the horizon to the point directly overhead. [Video: Planet Jewels of the Summer Night Sky]
 An Earthlit ball
 Also on Sunday evening, you may be able to see the full globe of the moon, its darkened portion glowing with a bluish-gray hue interposed between the sunlit crescent and only a bit of darker sky.
 This vision is sometimes called ""the new moon in the old moon’s arms."" Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) was the first to recognize it as what we now call ""Earthshine."" The effect is caused by sunlight bouncing off the clouds and ocean waters of our planet that is reflected up toward the part of the moon not illuminated by sunlight.
 But that's not all.
 As a bonus, this arrangement of the moon together with Venus and Jupiter will be positioned below the famous Pleiades star cluster, and will also be set against a fine V-shaped cluster of stars known as the Hyades. 
 Note the bright orange star at the end of the lower arm of the V, which represents the angry, fiery eye of the constellation of Taurus, the Bull. This colorful star is Aldebaran, ""the Follower;"" for it rises soon after the Pleiades and seems to pursue them across the sky. 
This skymap shows the position of Venus and Jupiter, in relation to the bright star Aldebaran and the Hyades and Pleiades star clusters, in the eastern sky on July 15, 2012.
 Keeping it all in perspective
 Keep in mind that this head-turning display will be merely an illusion of perspective: on Sunday, the moon will be only about 249,000 miles (401,000 kilometers) from Earth, while Venus is 175 times farther away, at 43.6 million miles (149.67 million km).
 Meanwhile, Jupiter is almost 2,115 times farther away than the moon, at 526.7 million miles (847.4 million km). Meanwhile, the Hyades — the nearest example of an open star cluster relative to our solar system — is located about 150 light-years away.
 Aldebaran, which from our vantage point appears to be a part of the Hyades, really isn’t. The star just happens to be an innocent bystander, merely located by chance in the line of sight between us and the Hyades star cluster. Aldebaran is, in fact, 65 light-years away, which is less than half the distance of the Hyades cluster.

186,SCIENCE,Unusual Asteroid Could Be An Interstellar Guest To Our Solar System,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unusual-asteroid-could-be-interstellar-guest-to-our-solar-system_us_5b02dd86e4b0463cdba4a1de,"The supposed ""interstellar immigrant"" is located near Jupiter but has an atypical orbit.",2018-05-21,TECH & SCIENCE,"Researchers postulate that a peculiar asteroid spotted near Jupiter is a permanent guest from a completely different solar system.
In an article published Monday in the U.K.’s Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, the researchers say their studies indicate that asteroid 2015 BZ509 (nicknamed BZ) is actually an “interstellar immigrant” that has been circling the sun ever since our solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the researchers, Fathi Namouni of France’s Côte d’Azur Observatory, told HuffPost that would make the discovery the first of its kind. 
“There is no other asteroid in the solar system that moves around the sun and is known to have been born outside the solar system,” he wrote in an email. 
BZ was discovered in 2014, according to The New York Times. The asteroid, a little less than two miles wide, is located near Jupiter and circles the sun every 11.6 years.
Scientists noticed that BZ has an unusual orbit. Instead of circling around the sun in the same direction as Jupiter, BZ has a retrograde orbit, meaning it circles the sun in the opposite direction. 
Namouni and the co-author of Monday’s article, Helena Morais of Brazil’s Universidade Estadual Paulista, were curious about why the asteroid moved in this unusual way. Using a time machine-like simulation, they recreated BZ’s possible movements over the past 4.5 billion years using their knowledge of the asteroid’s current orbit. 
“Surprisingly we found going back 4.5 billion years in the past, that the asteroid was moving exactly where it is now,” Namouni wrote. “But at 4.5 billion years in the past, all solar system objects, planets, asteroids and comets moved exactly in the same direction around the sun. This tells us that the asteroid was not born in the solar system but captured from outside it.”
Other astrophysicists have come up with alternate explanations for BZ’s retrograde orbit and suggested, for example, that the object could have come from the Oort Cloud, an icy mass of debris that some astronomers propose exists near the outer reaches of the solar system. Others say BZ could have come from Planet Nine, a hypothetical, hidden planet that some claim could lie beyond the dwarf planet Pluto. 
Regardless, Namouni believes BZ holds a wealth of information for scientists. Its relative proximity to Earth means scientists could analyze an object potentially from an alien solar system without needing to leave our own. Namouni said a robotic mission to BZ is “perfectly possible” with current technology.
Analyzing the asteroid’s chemical composition could help scientists understand how our own solar system formed ― and even provide insights into the origin of life. For example, if scientists discover that BZ contains water, it could signal that interstellar asteroids can deliver water to Earth and “hence indirectly contribute to the appearance of life,” Namouni wrote.

187,SCIENCE,"Scientists Scan 100,000 Galaxies But Find No Evidence Of Alien Life",Macrina Cooper-White,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/search-for-alien-life-100000-galaxies_n_7063232.html,,2015-04-15,TECH & SCIENCE,"Just how realistic is it to believe that humans will someday find evidence of extraterrestrial life?
NASA's chief scientist recently predicted that we'd find signs of life beyond Earth within a decade or so, but a new study by researchers at Penn State -- one of the most exhaustive of its type -- isn't very encouraging.  After surveying tens of thousands of galaxies surrounding our own Milky Way galaxy, the scientists turned up no sign of advanced alien civilizations.
""These galaxies are billions of years old, which should have been plenty of time for them to have been filled with alien civilizations, if they exist,"" Dr. Jason T. Wright, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the university's Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds and one of the researchers, said in a written statement. ""Either they don't exist, or they don't yet use enough energy for us to recognize them.""
Turning up the heat. For the research, Wright and his colleagues analyzed a vast catalog of observations made in 2010 by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) space telescope. The team looked at the heat emitted by the 100,000 ""most promising"" candidates of the all-sky catalog's nearly 100 million entries.
""The idea behind our research is that, if an entire galaxy had been colonized by an advanced spacefaring civilization, the energy produced by that civilization's technologies would be detectable in mid-infrared wavelengths -- exactly the radiation that the WISE satellite was designed to detect for other astronomical purposes,"" Wright said in the statement.
The hypothesis that advanced civilizations could be recognized by their waste heat was first put forth by renowned theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, according to Space.com.
Time to give it up? Despite his negative findings, Wright said his study, published April 15 in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, was ""just the beginning,"" and that further research may yet turn up evidence of alien technology.
And other experts involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) told The Huffington Post that they're far from discouraged.
Dr. Avi Loeb, a theoretical physicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., told HuffPost Science in an email that it's possible alien civilizations are hard to detect because they use much less energy than Dyson proposed.
""The limits reported in this study rule out the most extreme environmental impact possible for an extraterrestrial civilization that harvests a significant fraction of the starlight in its host galaxy,"" he said. ""For comparison, our civilization processes only a thousandth of a trillionth of the energy output of the sun. Less visible civilizations are much more likely to exist, both in terms of the technological feasibility of energy harvesting as well as in terms of their energy needs.""
Legendary astronomer Dr. Jill Tarter, the former director of the Center for SETI Research in Mountain View, Calif. and the astronomer on whom Jodie Foster's character in the 1997 film ""Contact"" was loosely based, agreed that efforts to find extraterrestrial life should continine.
""It's absolutely not time to stop,"" she told The Huffington Post in an email. ""It's time to improve the sensitivity and specificity of these searches to be able to discriminate between signals produced by Mother Nature and those produced by engineers.""

 ""I'm thrilled to share some exciting news,"" Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos wrote Friday (July 19) on his Bezos Expeditions website. ""44 years ago tomorrow [July 20] Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon, and now we have recovered a critical technological marvel that made it all possible.""
 In March 2012, the billionaire entrepreneur underwrote a private — and secret — expedition to find and recover the Apollo engines that launched astronauts Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins to the moon. [Apollo 11 Moon Rocket's F-1 Engines Explained (Infographic)]
 After their fuel was spent, the 12.2-foot-wide-by-18.5-foot-tall (3.7 by 5.6 m) F-1 engines were allowed to drop into the Atlantic Ocean. The force of the impact with the water and their ensuing plunge to the seafloor 14,000 feet (4,300 m) below the surface ripped apart the massive structures, leaving them almost unrecognizable.
 Corrosion removed from the base of a Saturn V engine thrust chamber recovered by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has exposed the serial number ""Unit No 2044"" stamped into the part's surface.
 In March 2013, Bezos revealed that his team had raised the parts for at least two F-1 engines, but they didn't know if they were from Apollo 11 or one of the 12 other Saturn V rockets that flew between 1967 and 1973, each equipped with five of the engines.
 ""There was one secret that the ocean didn't give up easily: mission identification,"" Bezos wrote on his website. ""The components' fiery end and heavy corrosion from 43 years underwater removed or covered up most of the original serial numbers.""
 The job of identifying the heritage of the thrust chambers, gas generators, injectors, heat exchangers, turbines, fuel manifolds and dozens of other F-1 engine artifacts fell to the conservation team at the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center in Hutchinson, Kansas. In addition to their work cleaning and stabilizing the parts for public display, the conservators were tasked with meticulously inspecting and documenting each component.
 ""One of the conservators who was scanning the objects with a black light and a special lens filter has made a breakthrough discovery – '2044' – stenciled in black paint on the side of one of the massive thrust chambers,"" wrote Bezos. ""2044 is the Rocketdyne [company] serial number that correlates to NASA number 6044, which is the serial number for F-1 Engine #5 from Apollo 11.""
 After removing more corrosion from the base of the same thrust chamber, the conservator also found ""Unit No 2044"" stamped into the massive engine part's metal surface.
 ""Huge kudos to the conservation team,"" Bezos exclaimed on his Expeditions site. ""Conservation is painstaking work that requires remarkable levels of patience and attention to detail, and these guys have both.""
 The team at the Kansas Cosmosphere expects that it will take about two years to complete the conservation of the engines. During that time, the public can view the parts and see the work being done to preserve them through a special tour offered at the museum's SpaceWorks facility.
 A website with a live camera view of the same facility is also being developed.
 The conservation work is being done under an agreement between Bezos and NASA. The space agency is retaining ownership of the artifacts and will ultimately decide where they go on museum display.
 In addition to the National Air and Space Museum, Bezos earlier expressed interest in having one of the engine's parts displayed at The Museum of Flight in Seattle, which is located near Amazon's headquarters and the offices of Blue Origin, the commercial spaceflight company founded by Bezos in 2000.
 That at least one of the F-1 thrust chambers is now known to have flown on Apollo 11 adds to the historical significance to the engine parts' eventual exhibit.
 ""This is a big milestone for the project and the whole team couldn't be more excited to share it with you all,"" Bezos stated.
 Take a look at the F-1 engine parts being conserved at the Kansas Cosmosphere's SpaceWorks Observation Gallery.

NASA says the probe will continue its mission into the Kuiper Belt, the vast region of primordial debris that encircles our solar system. 
It will be lonely out there for sure. But maybe not as lonely as you might imagine. As McClatchy D.C. reported, the New Horizons probe won't be the only spacecraft at our solar system's edge -- it will be joining four other unmanned spacecraft that are already speeding their way out of the solar system: Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2.
(Story continues below images.)
The venerable Pioneer 10 spacecraft was launched in 1972 to explore Jupiter. It sent its last signal to Earth in 2003.
The Pioneer 11 spacecraft was launched in 1973 to explore Saturn. It sent its last signal to Earth in 1995.
The Voyager 1 spacecraft, which launched in 1977, made the historic entry into interstellar space in 2012 and continues to send signals back to Earth.
The Voyager 2 spacecraft, which launched in 1977, also continues to transmit data back to Earth.
While in the Kuiper Belt, New Horizons will examine celestial objects found in the region until it runs out of fuel, the Guardian reported.
""We have a chance to go further and explore the deep reaches of the heliosphere, like Voyager did, and to do that with much more modern instruments,"" Dr. Alan Stern, the principal investigator of New Horizons, told USA Today, ""and hopefully return data that will really add to the storehouse of what we know about our environment in the solar system.""
New Horizons has enough power to keep operating until the mid-2030s, Stern said. By that point it will be roughly 9.3 billion miles from the sun--and will continue on its way even after it falls silent.

Evolutionary biologist and author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-ideas-about-the-evolution-of-same-sex-attraction_us_5baeb39fe4b014374e2dffa7,"The idea is that when the epi-marks on genes that affect sexual orientation get passed from father to daughter, then some traits end up more masculinized. Likewise, mother-son transmission of epi-marks can result in the feminization of some traits.",2012-12-15,TECH & SCIENCE,"When I give talks about the relevance of evolution to modern life, I can count on one regular question interrupting an orderly transition from lecture theater to bar. Sometimes it comes with a ""bet-you-didn't-think-of-that-one"" sneer. Far more often it is asked earnestly and with palpable empathy. The question? ""How do you explain homosexuality?""
The very real fact that a large proportion of people across the world are sexually attracted to members of the same biological sex provides a giant obstacle to a Darwinian view of life. And I am always happy to field this question, because it allows me to explore, with the audience, some of the layered complexity of evolution. But a simple, definitive answer remains, for now, beyond reach. That may start to change, however, with a paper published yesterday in The Quarterly Review of Biology.
Born This Way
Evolutionary biology can be a bit of a blunt instrument, especially when it seeks to explain big, categorical differences -- like sex differences. Focusing at a broad scale means a lot of nuance and individuality gets ignored or trampled, which is why so many authors -- quite unfairly -- write off all biology as determinism.
Fortunately, biological ideas about homosexuality tend to be more welcome than biological ideas about, say, gender. That may be because so many gay people strongly feel that they were ""born this way,"" and because ideas about homosexuality being a choice or a curable condition proliferate in all but the most enlightened places.
But being ""born this way"" isn't necessarily the same thing as the traits involved being genetically determined. Genetic claims require genetic evidence. In support of a genetic basis, sexual sexual orientation has a moderate to high heritability, heritability being the statistic that describes how much of the variation in a trait is due to genetic differences among individuals.
But despite the statistical vapor trail indicating a substantial genetic basis, the search for major genes involved in homosexuality has been far less fruitful. And then there remains the problem so beloved of seminar questioners: How could any such genes have persisted through millenia of selection if they lead to sexual orientations that do not produce offspring?
The idea that ""gay people don't have children"" is simplistic and, historically, wrong. Being gay does not necessarily mean not having a family, and throughout history many -- perhaps most -- homosexuals spent time in heterosexual unions, having children. And yet even if a small proportion did not, this could have exerted strong evolutionary selection against any genes involved.
But perhaps those genes provided some other kind of evolutionary advantage that outweighed the direct cost of having fewer kids. Here, theories lie thick upon the ground. First, there is the idea that homosexual relatives provide exceptional help to their heterosexual relatives who are raising families. Any genes that raise the chances of homosexuality, then, are passed on through relatives. And the extra help means more nieces and nephews carrying those genes.
The second group of ideas hinges on the idea is that genes that make reproductively successful females can increase the likelihood of homosexuality when they find themselves expressed in males. And the opposite can happen for genes that enhance male fitness. Some support for this idea exists, as well, including evidence that families in which females tend to be highly fertile also have a higher proportion of gay men than one might expect by chance.
And Brendan Zietsch has written here about his own work showing that psychologically feminine men and psychologically masculine women who are heterosexual also tend to be more sexually attractive. He argues that genes that raise the chances of an individual being same-sex attracted also massively raise the mating success of heterosexual bearers being reproductively successful.
Each of these ideas has some empirical support, but not such strong support that the case can be closed. It remains likely that there is no single explanation and that several biological influences together shape sexual orientation.
The New Idea
But yesterday's big story is an entirely new idea that hinges not on traditional genetics but instead on epigenetics. The fact that gene expression is modified by molecules that attach to particular genes but can later be removed is revolutionizing almost every biological field, including evolution.
Genetics defies metaphors, but I'll try to mangle one for folks who prefer J. K. Rowling over modern molecular genetics. If we think of a person's DNA as a recipe book -- say Advanced Potion Making by Libatius Borage -- then the epigenetic marks (or epi-marks) are the annotations and corrections made in pencil by the owner. Epi-marks have many functions, many of them tailoring the DNA instructions to suit the circumstances in which an individual finds himself or herself.
Most epi-marks get erased before the recipe is copied and handed down to an individual's offspring, but that isn't always the case. Sometimes there are good adaptive reasons that offspring inherit epi-marks from a parent. And sometimes, like Harry Potter inheriting the Half-Blood Prince's potions book, they receive annotated instructions that were not intended for them.
Bill Rice, Urban Friberg and Sergey Gavrilets recognized that epi-marks are an essential component of sex differentiation. Males and females share an entire genome, and so development is fraught with instructions intended for embryos of one sex but not the other. One class of epi-marks protects female fetuses from the masculinizing effects of fetal testosterone. Another protects male fetuses from being feminized when estrogen signals would otherwise trigger female development.
Different genes are involved in the development of genitals, reproductive organs, body shape, sexual orientation and every other trait where genes shape sexual differentiation. And so epi-marks to these different genes will have different influences on those traits.
Mostly, these kinds of epi-marks should not be passed from parent to offspring, but occasionally some are. And when the epi-marks on genes that affect sexual orientation get passed from father to daughter, then some traits that would normally develop in female-specific ways end up more masculinized. Likewise, mother-son transmission of epi-marks can result in the feminization of some traits that would normally develop in a more masculinized fashion.
I should stresss that the new paper is a mathematical model showing that this scenario can work. The authors marshal plenty of circumstantial evidence that it probably does work. But the idea needs to be directly tested.
Apart from the fact that this is one of those rare ideas that completely changes how we look at the evidence, I am most excited by the way this idea reframes how we look at sexual development. I suspect that this idea will, in time, also shake up the science of sex differences and our understanding of how gender arises.

194,QUEER VOICES,Is Denver The New San Francisco? Denver's PrideFest Makes You Think So,"Mark A. Thompson, ContributorA member of SATW and New York Travel Writers Association, Mark...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-denver-the-new-san-francisco-denvers-pridefest_us_5949bc8ce4b0710bea889a59,"Though Denver is the nation’s 19th most populous city, its annual PrideFest is the third largest Pride festival in the nation.",2017-06-21,VOICES,"It’s possible that Denver has become the 21st-century equivalent of San Francisco in the Sixties: a utopian vison where the default setting is a blissed-out optimism about the future.
Nearly 400,000 people attended this year’s Denver PrideFest, the city’s annual two-day celebration of Pride that transforms Denver’s Civic Center Park into a kaleidoscopic mash-up of Woodstock and Burning Man. For as far as the eye could see and the telephoto could capture, Denver’s vast Golden Triangle of culture was a sea of happy people surfing the chilled groove and cheering for entertainers who included Jennifer Holliday, Peppermint, and Chad Michaels. 
“I remember my first PrideFest and just being so overwhelmed by the spectrum of humanity and the rainbow of our community,” says deejay Alyson Calagna of Remix Your World who moved to Colorado six years ago. “From baby dykes to bears, the entire gamut of humanity and everyone so colorful and expressive and unique. It’s everything.”
One of the fastest-growing cities in the States, Denver is in the midst of another construction boom. According to the Denver Post, the city’s latest population surge, which commenced in the 1990s, has been driven by millennials who comprise more than half of new residents. 
“I wanted to see the sky, but I still wanted a city with a metropolitan feel,” says Calagna. “I’m originally from Louisiana and when I moved out here, it felt like home again. People are so friendly. You talk to strangers, the people in line at the grocery store. To have all that in a progressive city, I have just embraced this community more than any other place. It’s such a conscious city. A forward-thinking, conscious city.”
Colorado’s legalization of marijuana in 2014 has resulted in cannabis tourism, with Denver hosting a smorgasbord of recreational and medical cannabis dispensaries. To step into this world of edibles, topicals, extracts, concentrates, and proprietary strains is to recognize how quickly the blissed-out future has expanded.
Soon after I landed in Denver, I heard from several friends back East, millennials who texted “Why didn’t you tell me you were going to Denver? I love Denver”—which reminded me of the wanderlust inspired by San Francisco in the Seventies.
More than a thousand newcomers arrive in Denver each month, which has helped make Colorado the second-fastest growing state in the US. “We’re really glad you’re here, but just don’t stay too long,” joked the concierge at the Art Hotel. 
Regarding Denver’s welcoming spirit, Jayne Buck, Vice President of Tourism at Visit Denver, says, “It doesn’t matter if you’re a grandma or a twenty-something, the city is open to difference and new perspectives. What I hear most often from people who come here is, ‘I feel at home.’ In either 24 or 48 hours, they tell me, ‘I feel at home here.’ I think it starts from the Gold Rush, that sense of seeking an adventure, embarking on a new chapter, and then finding yourself in the process. You take on a new skill. It’s a place where people are encouraged and allowed to be themselves.”
Though Denver is the nation’s 19th most populous city, its annual PrideFest is the third largest Pride festival in the nation—which says a lot about Denver’s LGBT community. According to Rex Fuller, Vice President of the GLBT Community Center of Colorado, “Denver has a real live-and-let-live attitude; LGBT folks feel comfortable here. We held our first Pride event 42 years ago.”
“We appreciate the individuality of people,” says Buck. “We really embrace that—and the LGBT community is something that inspires all of us because of what they have had to overcome. I think it makes you want to be more accepting.”
PrideFest is the largest annual fundraiser for the Center, which has served the LGBT community since it opened in 1976. One hundred percent of PrideFest’s proceeds support the programs and services of the Center, a non-profit organization whose mission is to empower, engage, enrich, and advance the LGBT community of Colorado. 
As Fuller attests, “Denver is the largest metropolitan area in this part of the country, so we serve as a hub for rural areas of Colorado and neighboring states—we have the same draw for isolated LGBT folks that other urban cores have. People come here to find acceptance and to build a community.”
Under the umbrella theme of Viva La Vida, nearly 200 organizations marched in the 42nd annual PrideFest Parade, which traversed a 1.5-mile route from Cheesman Park along Colfax Avenue to Denver’s Golden Triangle. At Civic Center Park, more than 250 vendors offered a plethora of rainbow accoutrements. 
According to Buck, “The common denominator throughout Denver is that it’s open-minded and welcoming to new perspectives and the ability to integrate them. There’s an entrepreneurial spirit and the sense that you can be who you want to be and that spirit is infectious and contagious. It’s relaxed, but at the same time, it’s energized.” 
Denver’s erstwhile mayor, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper addressed the Pride Rally for Equality, reminding the audience of the importance of voting and of Colorado’s ongoing commitment to equality. 
“Denver’s LGBT scene is so diverse,” says Calagna. “We have One Colorado, and there’s a huge lesbian scene between Denver and Boulder, and we have all the greatest deejays—and DragNation and Tracks. You ask any of the queens from RuPaul and they’ll tell you, DragNation is the greatest show in America. The scene, the crowd, the diversity. It feels old school and yet still very modern. What can I say, Denver is the shit.”
The future is coming, in spite of the current Presidential administration’s desire to turn back time—and, more than ever, the future looks like Denver.

In addition to competitive NFL post season match-ups and the annual Golden Globes taking place this weekend, Adult Swim’s hit animated series, “Black Dynamite” will also air its season finale titled, “The Wizards of Watts.”
The hour-long musical special, which will feature guest appearances from the likes of Tyler The Creator, Erykah Badu, Tim Blake Nelson and J.B. Smoove, will follow the show’s lead character, Black Dynamite, as he finds himself in the middle of a police infused riot during his one-day vacation. And despite the topic of police misconduct leading news headlines in recent months, show writers ironically insist it wasn’t in their intent to be “current.” 
“This episode was written over a year and a half ago so it was never with the intent and purpose to be current,” writer-director, Carl Jones, revealed in a email statement to the Huffington Post. “It started as a parody of the Wizard of Oz that dealt with the pre-existing epidemic of police brutality.”
“It’s always important to me to tell stories that are honest and that not only speak to me but the human condition,” he added. “Police brutality itself is a byproduct of black people’s socioeconomic disposition in this country. Institutionalized racism is interwoven into the fabric of the country, police brutality is just one thread.” 
Black Dynamite’s “The Wizards of Watts” will air Saturday, January 10th, at 10:30 PM ET/PT on Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim.

197,QUEER VOICES,A Mother's Personal Story About Her Trans Child and Public Bathrooms,"Janna Barkin, ContributorMom, trans ally, activist and consultant, yoga teacher, nature...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ill-go-with-you_b_8604466.html,"Our kid looked like he belonged in the men's room, but it is not okay in our society to take one's daughter into a men's room after a certain age. We were confused and so was our child.",2015-11-22,VOICES,"
How do you know which bathroom to use? 
For cisgender people this is a simple question to answer: You use the men's room if you're a man, and you use the women's room if you're a woman. (""Cisgender"" refers to people who identify with their birth sex.) But for transgender and other gender non-conforming individuals, just going into a public bathroom can be a challenging and even dangerous experience. 
There are many people who want to legislate which bathrooms people get to use. These bathroom police want laws that say a person's gender as recorded on their original birth certificate is the only basis for determining whether a person uses the men's room or the women's room. Such laws are discriminatory against transgender and gender non-conforming people. They also are a violation of privacy -- who's going to be checking?!
I am a mom to a transgender child. He is almost 18. His birth sex was female. (To be clear, I will use male pronouns for Amaya throughout this blog. Our family and community used female pronouns for Amaya until he asked us to switch at age 14.) His transition from female to male was gradual, starting when he was 3. He says his transition is ""complete for now."" 
When he was very young, bathroom trips with our little tomboy were easy. Either my husband or I could go into any bathroom with him. But as he got older, he began to look out of place in the women's room. 
In our culture it is acceptable for a parent to take a child of opposite gender into the restroom when they are very young. Tolerances shift around age 5 or 6, and certainly by age 9 children are expected to use the facilities that match their birth gender. Things can get tricky for children whose outward appearance or inner gender identity differs from the gender they were assigned at birth, and for their parents as well. 
Very early on, our ""girl"" looked out of place in the women's room. When I took Amaya to a restroom, it was clear many people were concerned. Some stared and whispered. I often noticed surprise and even shock on people's faces. I know they were thinking: there's a boy in the girls' room. I would even call out to my child, ""Hey girl, you can wash your hands over here,"" to subtly assure these people that everything was okay. I felt uncomfortable, to say the least. My child was well aware of the commotion and would hold my hand very tightly. 
My husband and I discussed our problem. Our kid looked like he belonged in the men's room, but it is not okay in our society to take one's daughter into a men's room after a certain age. We were confused and so was our child. 
Using the restroom at school caused anxiety that only increased as the years went by. Amaya would frequently have stomachaches. We realized he was not using the bathroom at school. When we spoke to the school about it, he was offered use of the office bathroom as an option. He didn't like doing that, as it made him ""different."" When he got older, he figured out that going during class made it less likely that there would be others in the bathroom. 
I remember the day Amaya took matters into his own hands. He was about 14, just beginning his transition, and we were on a family trip to New York. We were at a Broadway show and the bathroom lines at intermission were incredibly long. While standing in the line for the women's room, I looked over at the men's line and saw my husband -- and to my surprise, Amaya was in line just a few people ahead of him. Gabriel and I looked at each other in acknowledgment of what we were witnessing. This was our child affirming his gender as male. Amaya was looking forward and didn't notice us noticing him. 
No one else seemed to notice either. 
He had made a conscious decision to stand in that line. It was clear he felt more comfortable in the men's line. It was also clear that everybody else was also comfortable with him being in the men's line. Had my child been waiting in the women's line with me he would have only received confused looks and stares. Not one person in the men's line that day batted an eye.
Most individuals know instinctively which bathroom they feel is right for them, and they will choose the one that most closely corresponds to their gender identity. Denying a trans person the right to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity is an act of discrimination, one that can have devastating consequences. Social movements such as #wejustneedtopee and #Illgowithyou  have brought internet attention to the absurdity of laws that would force trans men into the women's room and vice versa. For photos click here.
Everyone goes. Everyone should feel safe when they do. 
It is a huge misconception that cisgender people are in danger from transgender, intersex, gender fluid, non-binary or other gender non-conforming people in public bathrooms. There is not one substantiated incidence of a trans person committing any type of crime against anyone in a public bathroom. In contrast, there are many documented incidents of violence against transgender people, especially trans women. Click here for the most recent statistics.
According to the National Center for Transgender Equality, only 17 states have laws that specifically prohibit discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation in public accommodations. Some cities and towns have similar municipal laws. It's a start but it is not enough. 
The Equality Act of 2015 is currently in Congress and supported by President Obama. This sweeping act would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to ban discrimination nationwide based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Please read about The Equality Act and consider contacting your local Congresspeople to encourage them to vote for it. Click here to view the document.

Until there is full protection under the law, if you are transgender or gender non-conforming and you feel unsafe using a public restroom I'll go with you.

As of Tuesday, “Get Out,” a psychological thriller about racism, has earned $110 million in box-office sales, making Jordan Peele the first black writer-director to break the coveted $100 million threshold with a feature debut.
Peele humbly acknowledged his accomplishment Tuesday:
There have been several black directors who have had their feature debut pass that mark, as noted by BlackFilm.com, however, none have earned that status with their own screenplay. “Get Out” is also the fastest film from production company Blumhouse to reach the $100 million mark, earning that status in just 16 days, according to Deadline.
Peele, a comedian widely known for his Comedy Central show “Key & Peele,” made his directorial debut with “Get Out.” The film was made on just a $4.5 million budget and has since become a real standout in Hollywood. 
“Get Out” follows the experiences of a young black man who heads to a rural town to visit his white girlfriend’s family for the first time. The weekend away turns out to be a puzzling and suspense-filled trip where the young man realizes that the white people who live in and visit the home don’t have the best intentions. 
The movie has earned much acclaim among moviegoers and critics alike, who have praised the film’s brilliant and mind-bending take on race. Some film reviewers have called it a “watershed feat,” while others credit Peele for directing a clever thriller that explores various aspects of being black in America. The film even earned a 100 percent score on the film review site Rotten Tomatoes in its first 40 reviews, and the good news doesn’t stop there. 
Peele said he plans on releasing an entire series of “social thrillers” that fuse horror with daily human experiences. He plans to unveil four more films that follow this theme within the next decade.
“There’s several other ideas that have been germinating for the past eight years, and I’d like to do all of them,” Peele told The Verge in a recent interview. “As far as I’m concerned, my next decade or so — along with helping other untapped artists, or untapped identities, find their own platforms as a producer — I want to write and direct these four other social thrillers.”

I'm told I inspire, if that's true what's the next step? Do you listen to your body and take action? There has to be the desire, the energy, the love for what you are doing.",2015-05-14,VOICES,"Your body is a Stradivarius and for it to respond with a beautiful tone, you have to love it and practice on it every day. My body is my Stradivarius. I say thanks every waking and sleeping moment for the amazing gift, my mother gave birth to. Even at birth I had such energy, curiosity, and elasticity. The world was a wonderland; a treasure and it belonged to me. 
Now nearly 100 years later, I experience not only the same feelings, curiosity and energy, but something more; desire and love for the gift of life. I experience living and realize the wisdom that only comes with living.
Age is a gift. If you think of age as a gift you will understand what to do with it. How to love it, to use it, to appreciate it. You will be creative in every physical and mental even spiritual way. I think of my body, as a musical instrument. It has to be tuned, polished, balanced and loved. Developing a beautiful tone is like developing a beautiful and powerful muscle. And silence, you have to learn how to listen to your instrument. Your wonderful instrument not only speaks to you, it demands that you listen. Your instrument has incredible memory, it knows silence and dislikes your impatience. If you listen to your instrument, it will find the knowledge it needs to move with grace, power, and energy. When that happens you will take a huge step into a life that everyone would give a million bucks for.
I don't do the things that I do because I think I should do them. I jump rope four minutes every day because it feels so good to jump rope. I practice yoga because it makes me feel better and I practice tango, because I'm in love with the dance form and the music. All this produces incredible joy and a creative and healthy life and body. So if you go to the gym because you feel you must go to the gym, instead of, I love all the exercises and those exercises give me and my body the breath of life, what more can one ask. It's basically all about loving what you do and why you do it. The reason you don't move? You get in the way. You were born to move. Give your beautiful instrument a break. Love it, teach it, and train it. Allow the energy it owns to have a life. Now it's possible for you to have a life. And above all, listen, listen, listen to your body. It wants to be heard.
It only takes one step to change your sedentary life and that step is do it because you want to, not because you have to. I'm told I inspire, if that's true what's the next step? Do you listen to your body and face the challenge and take action? There has to be the desire, the energy, the love for what you are doing. Or my inspiration is a zero. It's simply a word. Wouldn't I love to know that my inspiration has created energy and dedication? And a better life. A life of quality. 
It starts with the listener, then the doer and the love of what you are doing. Then comes the reward. You have created energy, strength and balance. If there is fatigue, it's good fatigue, that comes with satisfaction. You've answered the call of your first instrument. That you did something physical and now you are on a therapeutic road of less pain. I didn't say no pain, that comes with perseverance and time. The reward is worth it.
When your body is out of tune it's painful. You have to face the challenge. No one can do this for you. This is what I hear: ""I cant do that because?"" The word 'because' is a killer and does nothing to correct the problem; ""because I'm too old"", ""because I have arthritis"", ""because I have osteoporosis.""
Almost all can be improved with activity. Arthritis responds to activity. I know because my body is full of arthritis. Shoulders, knees, feet, hands. I will not allow arthritis to take over my life. The only solution is major activity and the best way to practice major activity is yoga. With a huge Y! Take the first step ""a yoga class."" Your body will be hooked. You may not be, but your body is talking. So listen. 
Your Stradivarius is so expensive there is no number on its value. Only you know its value. So keep it well tuned. The music it will produce will be beautiful, powerful, and rewarding. 
You have been given this incredible instrument. Your first and only instrument. Love it and give it the life it deserves. What a gift! WOW!!!

The video, uploaded to YouTube Aug. 29, shows excerpts from news stories in which students of color across the country have been harassed at school. 
In one of the scenarios vandals hung a banner that read “build a wall” inside of an Oregon high school, imitating the Republican presidential candidate’s infamous immigration proposal.
“This is our school and this is where we learn. This is our environment. This is our second home, and it’s not fair that some of us don’t even feel safe coming,” explained a student featured in the video. 
In other cases highlighted in the ad, students chanted Trump’s name or waved cutouts of his face directed at students of color ― a move easily seen as intimidation. 
“Donald Trump is endangering our kids,” reads text featured in the ad. 
Trump’s rhetoric has incited an alarming level of fear and anxiety among children of color, many of whom worry they or a loved one will be deported, according to a report by the nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center titled “The Trump Effect: The Impact of the Presidential Campaign on our Nation’s Schools.”
The report also found some students have been “emboldened” by Trump’s divisive rhetoric:
 “Teachers have noted an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities have been the verbal targets of candidates on the campaign trail.”  
MoveOn’s ad aims to encourage viewers to protect kids from Trump’s hate speech by voting on November 8.
Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.

Oh, and that other one about 60 being ""old"" and too late to make changes.",2015-04-29,VOICES,"Yesterday at the gym while stretching post-workout, I overheard two women talking about Bruce Jenner's recent announcement that he was transitioning into a woman. (I wasn't exactly eavesdropping; if you saw the small area devoted to stretching, you'd understand why it isn't easy to ignore nearby conversations.)
""Why do you think he waited so long to come out with that?"" asked one. (I had often wondered that myself, but was pretty sure I understood the possible answer.)
I was already getting annoyed.
She lifted one leg effortlessly into a yoga-like pose, adjusted her stance slightly, then continued. ""I mean, he's old! He's in his sixties, at least! Why even bother to live your life over at that point?""
Now I was really annoyed.
""Well,"" answered the other, adjusting her posture as she bent down to lay her palms flat onto the floor. ""It's obvious he's going through some sort of midlife crisis.""
I had to remind myself to breathe and hold myself back from hurling obscenities her way.
I've heard people call Bruce Jenner's announcement a publicity stunt. I've heard some say that he's doing it just for the money. I've seen them roll their eyes. And then again, I've turned a deaf ear to the ones who like to ramble on judgmentally and equally without sympathy about the insanity of it all.
Everyone seems to have an opinion. And they're entitled to it.
I don't usually get involved in politically-charged conversations, especially with perfect strangers. Come to think of it, I don't like heated discussions even with close friends and family. Call me meek, but I'm happy to call it a typical Libra trait: non-confrontational; valuing fairness and justice above most things; steering clear of conflict or argument.
But I really had to fight to keep my mouth shut when I heard that midlife crisis comment. Oh, and that other one about 60 being ""old"" and too late to make changes.
First, midlife is not a crisis. Rather, it's a time when we are able to reevaluate our choices in life and realize that there is time to change those choices, turn things around, learn from the past and step forward with renewed wisdom and vigor -- and confidence. I like to call it Midlife Opportunity. In fact, when I started my other blog, MidlifeMatters, in 2009, it was one of the very first things I wrote about.
So it's possible, after all, that Bruce Jenner waited all these years because -- simply put -- he realized that now was the right time to do it. Which brings me to my next point about 60 being ""too old."" Banish that thought! I wanted to scream out that day in the gym. I went back to school when I was in midlife and I also ran my first half-marathon at 60. I don't think I'm so special or an aberration, either: there are people in midlife all over the place who are stepping out and starting new and important chapters in their lives. With great accomplishment, I might add.
While Jenner admitted that his feelings dated back more than 50 years to when he was 8 or 9 and shamefully tried on his sister's clothes, carefully putting them back exactly where they hung in her closet so he wouldn't be found out, can you imagine coming to real terms with his confused feelings, or even coming close to understanding them, in that era? He, like that entire generation, was caught up in the shame of being different and swept up by the urgent need to conform and belong. And he played that game to its extreme by becoming a idealized physical symbol of a male: athletic, muscular, strong and bold.
To me, Jenner is taking the precious years he has left and giving himself -- and many other transgender people -- a precious gift: to live a life in which they are comfortable and secure in who they are. Finally.
Crisis? I think not. I think any ""crisis"" Jenner might have been experiencing is a thing of the past. 
That male/female battle is no longer so tightly locked.

And as she has grown into herself, so too have those around her.",2014-11-15,VOICES,"Dear family and friends,
Many of you already know that, over the past year, my youngest child, who has been known to us all as ""Jon"" since birth, has been questioning, exploring, and, more recently, affirming her gender identity. (Yes, I have used the female pronoun here correctly. It turns out that for all these years I was using the wrong one. My bad!) What my child has come to understand is that she is transgender and identifies as female. She has chosen to call herself ""Elana,"" a name she feels more aptly reflects the person she knows herself to be.*
I realize that some of you might not be familiar with the term ""transgender"" or what it means to live as a transgender person. I have learned that a full understanding can be both deceptively simple and extraordinarily complicated at the same time. Thinking back to the moment of Jon's birth 15 years ago reinforces this observation. Toward the end of my labor, my husband and I experienced some moments of terror when the monitor showed a slowing heartbeat and the doctor declared, ""We have to get this baby out."" I remember hunkering down into a primal space and pushing for dear life, and although I did succeed in pushing this baby out, the room was leaden with silence as we all waited for that first cry of life, which was notably, frighteningly absent. When the wail came, the room seemed to explode with a palpable measure of joy. This is the simple part: I had birthed a healthy baby.
What followed is what follows the natural sequence of all births: the proclamation of the baby's sex -- in our case, a boy! Within seconds of the birth, everyone in the room had begun making and acting on assumptions about the significance of our child's genitalia. Since our baby quite visibly had a penis, we did not give the matter a second thought, and we forged ahead along the gendered path before us, as we had with our three older children, and as our parents had done when raising us. On a very basic level we assumed that the genitalia wholly determined the gendered direction of our child's life, and we also assumed that our child's identity would naturally align with maleness.
So here is where it gets more complicated. Most children are born with a penis or a vagina (and some are born with genitals that don't fall neatly into either category). For the majority of children, the brain and the body will match; that is, the interior -- the brain, or neuroendocrine system -- will work in tandem with the exterior, the physical body. These children will typically grow up aligned with the gender assigned to them at birth, and they will be comfortable in their skin, so to speak. For other children, the brain/body relationship is differently matched, complicating the relationship between the two. This can simply mean that that an individual with male genitalia knows herself to be female, and another with female genitalia knows himself to be male. (There are many other variations along the gender spectrum, which I will not go into here, but I would be happy to point you in the direction of more in-depth information, should you wish to learn more.) And now back to the simple part of this story and the most important truth of my life: I gave birth to a healthy baby, a human being, not a prepackaged promise of a predictable gendered life. 
And now I am the fortunate parent who lives in awe of her 15-year-old child, whose courage and conviction to live authentically in a largely unfamiliar and often less-than-friendly world is humbling. And as Elana has grown into herself, so too have those around her. I have watched our family's love deepen as we've traveled alongside Elana on her journey. I have seen the care with which our friends have made the switch from male to female pronouns and from ""Jon"" to ""Elana"" without blinking an eye or missing a beat. I have watched our community -- neighbors, teachers, doctors, nurses, and, yes, even police officers -- unequivocally agree to see and address my child as the person she knows herself to be. I have been blessed to see humanity outshine ignorance again and again. 
I am writing to you today to thank you for being a part of this amazing community we are fortunate to call home, and to ask you to join us in using the name ""Elana,"" along with her chosen corresponding pronouns, ""she"" and ""her.""
Much love to you all, L.
*I have used the pseudonym ""Elana"" to protect my child's privacy.

This expat is right. There's some planning...and a whole lot of commitment...and yes, some panic...involved in expatriation, that's certain. But certainly, not as much as parenthood involves.
When it's all said and done, the feeling of accomplishment you have as a successful expat is a badge to wear with honor. (And just like your childbirth stories, the tales you will have to tell!)
Much like the first stages of pregnancy, as you begin your expat journey -- especially if it's the first time you are moving to a foreign country--you won't know quite what to expect. You're sure to be a little nervous, but excited and happy, too.
And just as awaiting the birth of your first child, there will be many similar questions you will have: What will it be like? What will it look like? Will you love it? Will it love you? Will it be painful? How many years will you have together? Is there any way to make the unknowns a bit more certain? How much work and preparation will need to (or can) be done beforehand? And how much work and commitment will be required long term? 
(Oh, dear first-time parents, if you only knew the answer to that last one...)
Parenthood is the great unknown. And no matter how much you prepare, your expat life will be the same. There will be ups and downs and ins and outs, but at the end, you'll be better for it. You will have something uniquely your own, but in the case of living overseas, instead of making a mark on someone else's life, the mark you make will be on your own.
Is there a way to prepare for expat life... a way to be as sure as you can be that you'll love it and that, in return, it will love you back?
We've said it before: when contemplating a life abroad, do your research. Start here. Or better yet (and shameless plug), spend $20 and buy our book. (Think of us as your midwives.)
Most importantly, include yourself in that research. You are, after all, the most critical element in all of this. Your success or failure is in your hands. So think deeply about you and what makes you happy. 
We call this ""profiling yourself."" We mention it over and over again in our book and we've written about it many times in this blog and for others. 
Once you've identified where it is you want to go on your expat journey, you need to figure out how to make it happen; how to get there and how to stay there, what you'll take with you and what you'll leave behind. Not to mention all those nuts and bolts issues you'll need to address...like health care and mail and finances and taxes and... well, you get the picture. Those are the labor pains. And thankfully, you'll quickly get through them.
Importantly, you'll need a plan for what you'll do once you get where you're going. This is a crucial step that too many would-be expats overlook. There is only so much snorkeling, sunbathing and hammocking you can do... 
To go back to the parenting analogy, you usually have big plans for your children... plans you begin to formulate long before they are born. So do the same for your expat life. Think about the kind of community you want...not necessarily the scenery or the physical structures, but the people who live there. 
Make sure the community you are considering is a place that will contribute to your quality of life. Likeminded people, a safe environment, plenty of activities you enjoy and a pleasant climate in which to do them: these should top your list.
Come to think of it: aren't these the things we want for our children? A stimulating environment and a safe place to play.
It occurs to us that the analogies and similarities between impending parenthood and a move overseas are strong, indeed.
So here's some final food for thought: Those who fear parenthood don't understand that it's not something perfect people do, but something that perfects you. The end product isn't the child but the parent.
Likewise, those who fear living in a different culture will never experience the personal transformation that will result from that experience. 
And here's one more: As a parent, it's said that if you can give your child only one gift, let it be enthusiasm. 
The same is true about expatriation. Approach it with eyes wide open. With wonder and enthusiasm and affection. You will be rewarded.

Well, sort of. 
Artist Isaiah Stephens reimagined what a handful of Disney princesses would look like if they dressed like the late Queen of Tejano music. The result was nothing short of magical. 
Disney’s Tiana, Pocahontas, Snow White, Esmeralda, and Mulan each slay in their Selena-inspired getups, rocking everything from the singer's iconic purple jumpsuit to her famous ""bra with little sprinkly things on it.""
Stephens, a Massachusetts-based illustrator, told The Huffington Post the idea for the series came from Cosmo For Latinas’ web editor, Alanna Nuñez. “I was more than happy to do it,” he explains. “[Selena’s] story is so inspiring and beautiful, yet tragic. It makes it kind of lovely that even today she is still so… loved.” He would know. 
The self-confessed Selena fan told the Latin Times his illustrations were a labor of love, explaining that each drawing took between two to eight hours to create. Suffice it to say, his hard work paid off. Check out his beautiful illustrations below.

206,BLACK VOICES,Here's How To Support Minority Communities Right Now,Zahara Hill,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heres-how-to-support-minority-communities-right-now_us_58261529e4b0c4b63b0c6f95,"""We can’t stand divided.”",2016-11-14,VOICES,"Donald Trump’s victory, and the numerous hate crimes that have come after it, has left many minorities fearing for their safety and in need of support. 
HuffPost’s Jay Shetty sat down with HuffPost Voices editors, including social media editor Rowaida Abdelaziz, last week to discuss how allies can support the millions of minorities in this country who are left feeling vulnerable in the wake of Trump’s win. Abdelaziz, who is Muslim, explained why it’s important for people who haven’t been historically oppressed to be involved in the fight for change and equality. 
“Marginalized communities have been [mobilizing] for a very long time,” she told Shetty. “And we’ve always had a voice. So, it’s not that we’re just starting out. It’s that we need to be amplified and that’s where the allies come in.”
One way to become involved, Abdelaziz said, is to surround yourself with different types of people and ask questions to educate yourself. She added that even the smallest demonstrations of support ― like leaving a kind note for your neighbor ― are invaluable during difficult times. 
“It doesn’t take very much to find a local mosque, to find a local Islamic school, to just walk into any community center and say, ‘I’m here to learn. I don’t agree with what’s going on out there. I don’t agree with the hate. I think this is wrong,’” Abdelaziz said.
Queer Voices editor Curtis Wong raised another point about how being an ally doesn’t mean making others your enemy ― regardless of how different opinions may be. “It’s important to remember not to necessarily fight with people but fight for people,” he said. 
Since Trump’s election, there has been a spike in hate crimes around the country. A University of Michigan Ann Arbor student reported last Friday that someone threatened to set her on fire if she didn’t take her off her hijab. On the same day, a Baylor University student was escorted to class by a group of student allies after tweeting that she had been pushed and called a “n****r” on her way to class earlier in the week. 
Latino Voices editor Carolina Moreno addressed how allies should react when they witness hatred. “What we need now is empathy and not apathy, especially in the face of hate and violence,” she said. “You don’t have to start throwing punches, you can walk the person home. When you’re the victim and you’re being attacked, you feel alone in that moment.”
In addition to the presence of allies, the editors agreed that minority groups also need to come together for continued progress. 
“Our own individual struggles are still there,” Black Voices senior editor Lilly Workneh said. “But now we have a collective struggle and fight and we all have to band together and attack that...we can’t stand divided.”

207,LATINO VOICES,Stop Saying 'Not My President',"Nancy A. Ruffin, ContributorMother, Wife, Writer, and Life Strategist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stop-saying-not-my-president-and-do-something_us_582a11a3e4b057e23e314869,"Now isn’t the time to point fingers.
Now is the time we turn our anger towards something productive with tangible results.",2016-11-14,VOICES,"It’s been almost one week since Donald Trump was elected President in probably what’s been the most shocking Presidential election in American history. Since then, I’ve watched people blame the DNC, Hillary Clinton, non-voters, third party voters, women, Florida, Latinos, and each other for Trump’s win. 
I’ve watched friends admonish family members for voting for Trump. I’ve seen hate crimes against Latinos, Blacks, Muslims and other minorities increase. The Southern Poverty Law Center has documented over 200 incidents in the first 48 hours after the election alone. These are alarming numbers considering Trump hasn’t even taken office yet.
I’ve watched thousands of people in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and other major cities mobilize and protest against Donald Trump. There are Inauguration Day protest marches being planned and never have the American people been as opposed to a U.S. President as they are against Donald Trump. It is a moment in time unlike anything I’ve ever seen. 
The actions many are taking to voice their anger, rage, and fear speaks volumes of the division a Donald Trump presidency has already created in this country. He speaks of unifying the nation but his failure to address the recent blatant acts of racism by his supporters doesn’t support his rhetoric. 
Furthermore, his appointment of Steve Bannon, the Breitbart News Network executive chairman known for having white nationalist views, as chief strategist and senior counselor, does nothing to instill hopes of a unified nation under a Trump administration. Trump cannot expect the American people to believe his words when his actions are not aligned with what he is saying.
To say that passions are at an all-time high with Americans is an understatement. People are outraged, especially considering that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. It has caused many to challenge the current Electoral College process and question if it’s time to do away with it altogether. Donald Trump as president is not what the majority of Americans want, yet that is what we are left to deal with for the next four years. Carrying signs and hash tagging “Not My President” doesn’t change that. Trump is our President and we are stuck with him despite how much or how loud we protest. The question is what are we going to do now that he is? Did I vote for Trump? Absolutely not. Do I think he is the wrong person to lead this country? Unequivocally yes. But now isn’t the time to point fingers.
Now is the time we take our outrage and turn our anger towards something productive with tangible results. We cannot change the Presidential outcome, but we can mobilize in our communities. We can roll up our sleeves and do the hard grassroots work that is required of us. We can take responsibility for our neighborhoods and engage with our local representatives on a real level through deliberate dialogue. We can hold them to task by making our faces seen and our voices heard at every town hall meeting. We can get to know our local police chiefs, and our school superintendents. We can get to know our assembly men and women and educate ourselves on policies they’ve advocated for or against. We can call out injustice every time we see it and not just rant about in a Facebook post. 
The time is now for all disenfranchised groups to band together for the greater good of this country. If we try to fight for each group’s equality individually we will be fighting forever and we will never know what equal rights for all looks like. This division among us is precisely why Trump is our President. Divide and conquer is a real tactic and it’s the reason we need to stop dividing the fight for equality into sub groups for Blacks, Latinos, Women, LGBTQ, Muslims, Native Americans etc. Now is the time for all of us to unite if we indeed do believe in equality for all. 
Considering the country’s current political climate when it comes to race relations, women’s rights, police violence, healthcare, immigration, among the many other issues that plague this country, Trump’s inability to inspire unity, acceptance, and hope is dangerous. He says he wants to make America great again for all Americans, but in the short week since he’s been elected, he’s done nothing by way of his actions, to give me hope that he will indeed do great things for all Americans. In fact, this past week he’s already begun back peddling on some of the key campaign promises that got him elected like building that wall along the Mexican border.
In his first interview since his election, Trump told Leslie Stahl from 60 Minutes, that the infamous wall he plans on building across the Mexican border could be part fence. Part fence? Interesting how he never mentioned that during his campaign. His plan to immediately deport all undocumented citizens is another strategically fabricated lie. What he meant to say was, undocumented citizens who have committed crimes. 
What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate, Trump said. 
Are you deporting them or incarcerating them Mr. Trump? Which one is it? This sounds very different from what he was spewing on the campaign trail. Moreover, Obama has already deported 2.5 million undocumented criminals during his Presidency so Trump doing the same is no different from what the current administration is doing. I’m not quite sure how this is the change those who voted for Trump were seeking. 
What this proves to me is that a large segment of this country was so desperately seeking change, that they sided with the individual who seemed to present themselves as such. Trump isn’t doing anything differently, but the way he delivered his message sure made it seem like he was. Despite his more of the same politics on certain issues, the fact he is placing White supremacists in some of the key roles in his administration is what we should be concerned with. 
In my opinion, those who have his ear and those who are his advisers are greater cause for alarm as they will be instrumental in how Trump leads this country. To me, that is more frightening. If it were only Trump we had to worry about I wouldn’t be as concerned, because though Trump made a lot of promises during his campaign, considering his history with flip flopping on certain issues such as abortion, and considering how he is already deviating from some of his most popular campaign promises, it seems like he himself doesn’t know where he stands on certain issues. The only thing I am sure of when it comes to Trump is that he cannot be trusted. 
His ego centered narcissism is a direct contradiction of his ideology of wanting to make this country great again for all. He has never done anything for the greater good. His history proves that. His elitist mentality that has spanned over his 70 years doesn’t simply go away because he now finds himself elected President. Later this month he is scheduled to stand trial for the Trump University case. Not surprisingly his lawyers are asking for a postponement because, 
The President-Elect should not be required to stand trial during the next two months while he prepares to assume the Presidency. The time and attention to prepare and testify will take him away from imperative transition work at a critical time, Trump attorneys Daniel Petrocelli, David Marroso and David Kirman wrote.
We acknowledge plaintiffs have a right to trial of their claims, but their rights will not be abridged if trial were continued to a date after the inauguration to allow the President-Elect to devote all his time and attention to the transition process.
Once again Trump is trying to use his position, power, and privilege to his benefit. This is what we have traditionally seen from Trump and it is what we will continue to see for the next four years as he leads this country.Even though I would like nothing more to say that he is not my president, it still remains that he is. I can continue being angered by it and do nothing or I can use that anger and channel it towards working to create solutions that will challenge some of Trump’s policies designed to attack the most disenfranchised populations of this country. Come January the person chosen to lead us will change. The work I do, will not.
