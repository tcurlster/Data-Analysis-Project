0,ARTS,How One Woman Is Turning Her Online Harassment Into Art,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-davis-roth_n_5813070.html,,2014-09-13,ARTS & CULTURE,"This post originally appeared on Slate. 
By Phil Plait

My good friend, Amy Davis Roth, is awesome.
Or, more properly, awe-inspiring. On her own she is quite a person: A dedicated artist who produces cool jewelry, who creates wonderful paintings, who is an outspoken supporter of critical thinking and science, and who is also an intelligent, thoughtful, and vocal feminist.
She does all this—and much more—every single day while slogging through an unbelievable miasma of misogyny.
And I do mean unbelievable. For having the temerity to say that women should have equal rights, opportunities, and treatment as men, she gets a tsunami of hatred, venom, death threats, rape threats, and more. It would be enough to break down hardened people, and it has. But not Amy. She manages to not only deal with this horrifying onslaught but also turn it into art.
I mean that literally. With the help of several other atheist and skeptical women, Amy has created an exhibit called A Woman’s Room Online: a free-standing 8x10 foot room that is being installed in the L.A. Center for Inquiry office. It will look superficially much like any office in which a woman might work, with the usual accoutrements.
But each object will be covered with messages these women have received on Twitter, Facebook, and email. Real messages, actual things sent to them that are the vilest, most hateful examples of the worst humanity has to offer.

I recently visited Amy and stayed with her for a few days. She showed some of the individual pieces to my wife and me, and they are as powerful as the words plastered on them are repellent.
The words are hard to read, so difficult to imagine an actual human sending them to another human. They run the range from self-satisfied and arrogant to graphic and explicit threats against body and life. Sexism and misogyny had been brewing in the atheist and skeptical movements for some time but exploded when Rebecca Watson brought attention to them, and people were further polarized after Richard Dawkins made his “Muslima” comments in response. That was years ago, and things are no better ... as we've also seen in so many other online communities as well.
Perhaps sunlight is the best disinfectant, and art has a way of focusing that light. Over at Skepchick, Amy herself wrote a description of her installation, and I strongly encourage you to read it.
I think this is an important piece of art. I suspect a lot of people really don’t have any idea just how much filth women (not only feminists, but just women on the Internet guilty of Posting While Female) have to slog through every day just to exist online. It’s horrifying—and sadly, used as a way to shut women up; read Amanda Marcotte's recent post about this.
A Woman’s Room Online will hopefully open a lot of eyes. And minds. And, hopefully, hearts.
The exhibit opens this weekend, running from Sept. 13–Oct. 13 daily. For more information, contact the L.A. Women’s Atheist and Agnostic Group (a group Amy founded, and they're accepting donations through there as well).

Fortaleza, Brazil-- where Hélio Oiticica: Estructura Corpo Cor (Structure Body Color) is on view through May 1 at the University of Fortaleza's Espaço Cultural Airton Queiroz
FOR A MEETING last week, I flew three-and-a-half hours from São Paulo to Fortaleza, a beautiful city located in Brazil's northeast, and once more I was struck by how vast, rich and diverse this nation is. Geographically, the country is approximately the same size as continental United States, and though I've visited Brazil more than a hundred times, I'd never, until this trip, visited Fortaleza, the country's fifth-largest city. Brazilians in the nation's huge metropolitan areas of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro sometimes make disparaging remarks about nordestinos, the people from the northeast, thinking of them as poor and under-educated. But even a brief visit puts those slurs to rest. I'm so glad that I no longer think about Fortaleza as a fly-over city!
Facing the ocean, Fortaleza has a hyper-modern skyline of sparkling high-rise buildings-- think Toronto-meets-Miami Beach. Its multiracial population of more than three million drives a robust and diverse economy. And Fortaleza is a big tourist destination for the domestic Brazilian market. People are drawn by its tropical climate whose high humidity is made manageable due to its steady, pleasant ocean breezes. From a tourist's standpoint, the city serves up beautiful beaches, a fine cuisine, a world-class soccer stadium that put it in the FIFA World Cup series, a range of diverse music attractions and museums, and some of Brazil's most important universities and research centers.
On my visit, I had the pleasure of touring the 25,000-student campus of the University of Fortaleza. This included a visit to the Espaço Cultural Airton Queiroz to view Hélio Oiticica: Estructura Corpo Cor (Structure Body Color), a superb retrospective-like exhibition of sixty works. Unquestionably one of Brazil's most important artists--whose influence is felt in the U.S. and in Europe-- Hélio Oiticica had a diverse and active practice through to his death in 1980. The exhibition's curators Celso Favaretto and Paula Braga take you on his journey from formal, geometric abstract painting of the 1950s to three-dimensional abstractions in the early '60s and progressively more ephemeral, dynamic and performance-oriented works of the '70s.


Above, installation views, Hélio Oiticica: Estructura Corpo Cor (Structure Body Color), at the University of Fortaleza's Espaço Cultural Airton Queiroz
Physically, the exhibition space acts like a three-pointed star that nicely complements a reading of the artist's development-- as one wing presents the collaged sense of the relationship between his beautiful abstract paintings from the Metaesquema series, Oiticica's floating Spatial Relief sculptures, and performative boxes called Bólide; another wing draws out the relationship between the floating sculptures and his costumed performance works known as Parangolés, which are essentially wearable abstract paintings. Less familiar for me were the Bólide, and I came to really enjoy these performance boxes that might be described as the kind of Cornell box that would be made by a lunatic clown. One of my favorite bólide in this exhibition included a photo of a fallen figure and a small version of the artist's famous red banner with the words ""Seja marginal, seja herói"" (""Be an outsider, be a hero""), which is quite possibly one of my Top Ten favorite contemporary art works.
Below, Hélio Oiticica: Seja marginal seja herói (Be an outlaw be a hero), 1968; ink on cloth

The exhibition's third wing is devoted to one of Oiticica's Cosmococas--a series of immersive, multimedia installations in which viewers, said the artist, may ""discover their inner creative center, their dormant expressive spontaneity, subject to daily life."" There is something simply joyous in witnessing Oiticica's work, as he constantly engages us-- by inviting us to dress up and perform, or simply hang out in a mattress-filled ""chill-out"" lounge featuring photo projections and Jimi Hendrix songs. This entire show is a crowd-pleaser for audiences of all ages. Even a curmudgeon will leave with a smile. The show continues through May 1st.
I don't know how many of you will be able to consider Fortaleza on your next trip to Brazil, but you should...!

2,ARTS,"A Love Letter To Louise Bourgeois, A Feminist Icon Whether She Likes It Or Not",Katherine Brooks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/louise-bourgeois_n_5600404.html,,2014-07-19,ARTS & CULTURE,"Louis Bourgeois is a feminist art icon, even if she -- in some mythical afterlife populated by giant spiders and contorted, alien figures -- would hate the label. When she was alive, she was aloof on the subject. ""Some of my works are, or try to be feminist, and others are not feminist,"" she proclaimed in an interview with the San Francisco Museum of Art. 
""I am lucky to have been brought up by a mother who was a feminist and fortunate enough to have married a husband who was a feminist, and I have raised sons who are feminists,"" Germaine Greer quoted her as saying in The Guardian, not long after Bourgeois' death in 2010. The artist, famous for her mammoth sculptures of spiders, pointedly leaves herself out of the list, insinuating not a rejection of the -ism, necessarily, but perhaps a bit of condescension toward critics eager to associate her with the term, no matter her opinions.

Bourgeois does owe a lot to the feminist movement. Born in Paris in 1911, she spent many of her early years known merely as the wife of Robert Goldwater, the American art historian with whom she moved to New York in the late 1930s. Though she drew, painted, sculpted and printed throughout the 1940s and '50s, Bourgeois didn't receive real art world attention until her 50s. She had to wait more than a few years before she moved from the periphery of art critics' minds to somewhere closer to the center. During that time, the feminist movement was blooming.
""The specific agent of change was feminism, the most pervasive and radical of the many 'pluralist' constituencies of the last ten years,"" Robert Storr wrote in Art in America back in 1983, around eight years after she graced the cover of Artforum and one year after her retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. ""And more particularly the insistence of feminist artists and critics we look hard at for whatever was formerly considered 'marginal' in art, and hardest of all at the very notion that a 'mainstream' existed.""
For a woman who loathed the term ""woman artist,"" it seems to many so important that she was a woman artist at the time she rose to recognition. Amidst the hyper masculine aesthetic of the Abstract Expressionists and the coy fraternity of Surrealism, she quite literally forged ahead, casting ""anti-form"" creatures from marble and bronze. From her ""Femme Maison (Woman House)"" paintings created circa 1946-47, in which the bodies of nude women are forcefully squished into the confining spaces of a home, to her 1968 sculpture, ""Janus Fleuri,"" a piece curiously sexualized if not for its inclusion of imagery that resembles both male and female genitalia, themes of femininity and gender roles reared their heads.
 Louise Bourgeois, Lady in Waiting, 2003. Collection The Easton Foundation. Photo: Christopher Burke.
A fascination with the body is apparent throughout her career. While men like Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman were swimming in color fields, she rendered her self-portrait as a torso, pieced together with bizarre bulges and crevices that seem endlessly out of place. ""That, she said, was how she felt about her physical self,"" Michael McNay wrote, ""and by extension, how women generally felt, even while they studied copies of Vogue or Harper's Bazaar.""
The list could go on: There's the 1968 piece, ""Fillette,"" which was obviously a massive penis sculpture, one that happened to make its way into a photograph by Robert Mapplethorpe. There's the 1974 tableau, ""The Destruction of the Father,"" a gathering of mammary-like objects and penile knobs said to represent the ""sacrificial evisceration of a body,"" more specifically ""a pompous father, whose presence deadens the dinner hour night after night."" There's the 1984 ""Nature Study,"" appearing like a headless sphinx covered in breasts and equipped with Doberman Pinscher-esque claws.

She might not have been singing the song of feminist sirens, but her work relentlessly juxtaposed male and female forms, revealing hybrid bodies and aggressive amalgamations of phallic and yonic imagery; sexual subject matter from a woman's gaze. 
Her vocalized stance on a woman's social position versus that of a man's was at times confusing. She seemed simultaneously angry at the idea that masculinity and its own brand of ego were wrapped up in a penis, and disappointed that feminine beauty often went hand-in-hand with passivity. 
""It's a dialogue between a man and a woman,"" Bourgeois recounted in another interview with SFMOMA, cryptically titled ""Louis Bourgeois on Gender Roles."" She outlines an interesting, if not depressing scenario attached to a phantom piece of art, a retelling that's almost incomprehensible as a total story, but a strange exchange nonetheless that gives glimpses of her own sentiments toward men and women.
 Louise Bourgeois, Untitled, 2002. Collection The Easton Foundation. Photo: Christopher Burke.
""You know what men are like,"" she says to an unidentified male companion. ""For example, it's about a man who discovers a vaccine. He discovers a vaccine, he's a bigwig. As for her, she stumbles upon a little sofa at the auction rooms. Understand? That's the relationship. If that doesn't convince you, I can give you other examples. For example, when he speaks. Of course, when he speaks the world stops in its tracks. Whereas she, she just chitchats. And when it's time for dinner, he's the chef. He prepares this wonderful meal! Whereas she, she just cooks. Just cooks. And he feels good, he whistles. He whistles like a blackbird. Whereas she whistles to herself. And when he feels good he touches you, right? He touches you. Whereas she, she brushes against you. To no effect... like pissing in the wind.""
It wasn't until the 1990s that she went the way of the spider. Sculpting for heights of 35 feet, she created her first arachnid in 1999 and they quickly proliferated, as spiders are wont to do. Titled ""Maman,"" the spindly creatures and their egg sacs, made from stainless steal, marble and bronze, stood as tributes to Bourgeois' mother, Josephine. ""The Spider is an ode to my mother. She was my best friend. Like a spider, my mother was a weaver... spiders are helpful and protective, just like my mother.""
 Louise Bourgeois, Untitled, 2001. Collection The Easton Foundation. Photo: Christopher Burke.
Dark, ominous, and absent of the smooth curves of femininity, ""Maman"" projected a very different female object in places like Bilbao, Tokyo and Ottawa. Frightening yet maternal, sinister yet life-giving, antagonistic yet martyred -- these contradictions seemed Bourgeois' way of breaking through the gender binary, up until her last days at the age of 98. ""I have fantastic pleasure in breaking everything,"" she once said. Yet towards the end of her life, she created, with delicacy, particularly in the realm of tapestry. This was yet another way of honoring her mother, and achieved a sense of ""reparation.""

Her defiance, her arguably unmatched persistence, her visual tenacity -- these qualities will forever cement Bourgeois' place in feminist art history. Not because she's a woman artist -- a label hardly derogatory -- but because she pushed the boundaries of what it meant to make art. 
“Feminist art is not some tiny creek running off the great river of real art,"" as Andrea Dworkin declared. ""It is not some crack in an otherwise flawless stone. It is, quite spectacularly I think, art which is not based on the subjugation of one half of the species."" Bourgeois should be proud to count herself amongst those who made feminist art.
""Louise Bourgeois L’araignée et les tapisseries"" is currently on view at Hauser & Wirth Zürich until July 26. All images included in this post are courtesy of Hauser & Wirth unless otherwise noted.

3,ARTS,Atlanta Symphony Lockout Is Enforced Silence,"Alan Fletcher, ContributorComposer, commentator, President and CEO of the Aspen Music Fe...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/atlanta-symphony-lockout-_b_5883036.html,"What is needed, in Atlanta and everywhere, is the recognition that all sides play a part. It's how philanthropy works -- a partnership, an investment, a shared good. It's how artistry works. Dare I say, it's how excellent management works.",2014-09-25,ARTS & CULTURE,"More than a year ago, the Minnesota Orchestra lockout, which would become the longest such anti-labor action in modern musical history, prompted many in the music world who weren't used to public comment to become involved. Community organizations and blogs were created and played a meaningful role in the dispute, its resolution, and the rebuilding process that continues in Minneapolis.
Because I took a modest part there, it seems important to take part in the discussion of the current Atlanta Symphony lockout. I have much more at stake personally in Atlanta: the Atlanta Symphony Music Director, Robert Spano, is also Music Director of the Aspen Music Festival and School, where I am CEO; I have good friends and valued colleagues both among the musicians in Atlanta and in its administration.
The only place to begin is by affirming that the tactic of a lockout is wrongheaded. Wrongheaded not because it cannot ""work"" -- the previous Atlanta lockout two years ago might be said by management to have worked.
Just after that earlier Atlanta lockout, I was backstage at Carnegie Hall after a concert given by the Atlanta Symphony. I was struck by the enmity shown to Atlanta's CEO by virtually every musician. It was a chilling example of the outcome of a lockout.
It doesn't bring about a shared sense of participation in the mission of the organization. It doesn't emphasize the respect that all parties in such a mission ought to have for each other's contributions. It doesn't build for the future. In Atlanta it did bring about concessions and prepared a platform for future similar actions, in Minneapolis and now again in Atlanta, for instance.
It's like saying war clearly works, by looking at the model of World War I and the Treaty of Versailles.
A strike is a tactic in which passionately partisan people sacrifice their own incomes and family well-being for what they believe. I have not liked any of the strikes we have seen, as the tactic is so peremptory.
But a lockout is very different: it is a tactic by which those in power -- both governing boards and management -- deprive others, not themselves, of a livelihood as a way of imposing their beliefs. It depends on might making right. It negates the mission of the organization, which is to make music. To make music, not to make money, not to perpetuate a political view of culture, not to produce social cachet, though all of those might be interesting by-products.
We need negotiations that do share participation in the mission, that do incorporate respect for differing views of what is best for the organization and for its constituents, and that do leave the door open for future working together. In many recent high-profile negotiations, both sides trampled on these principles (often by proxies or representatives of musicians rather than the players themselves). When, over a number of years and through different economic situations, an orchestra has a continuing deficit, something indeed must change. San Diego Opera and the Met are working out hybrid solutions: cut costs in all areas, maintain a vital artistic presence, renew the commitment of existing donors, and bring new energy to fund raising. A negotiating stance that pins all the problems on one part of the budget, whether that's labor costs, ticket sales, or contributed income, is not likely to succeed and damages the credibility of those advancing it.
In an old-fashioned business model, all arts organizations run at huge deficits all the time, because the sales revenue of the product has never come close to matching its cost. People talk about fund raising as if it were a spigot that turns freely -- I myself have heard the comment ""Well you just didn't raise enough money!"" (I felt like knocking my head and saying, ""Oh, that's what I was forgetting!"") Raising money is not a simple transaction; it depends on belief and confidence.
It's important to differentiate the goals of a board, in this case the board of the Woodruff Center for the Arts (a board not primarily committed to music) and the management of the orchestra. The Atlanta Symphony's president, Stanley Romanstein, is someone for whom I feel much friendly regard. I am persuaded that he is in his position because of his love for music, and that he wants the orchestra to succeed.
That doesn't make reasonable or correct his adherence to tactics perhaps dictated by the boards to whom he reports. The tremendous majority of board members I have known in the non-profit world -- and I have known a great number, and have served on numerous boards - are in it for true philanthropic reasons. Even if they are not able to be the most important donors, they can make essential contributions. If they are business people, they can bring significant value in their knowledge of marketing, of outreach, of financial best practice, of investment expertise. If they are able to make large donations, they reasonably expect to help in the direction of the organization as well.
This doesn't mean that non-profits should act like corporations. They should, through thick and thin, stay true to their missions.
Friends in the arts world, for whose opinion I generally have respect, have disappointed me by taking a harsh view of all administrators. There is a disdain, which can almost feel like hatred, for the very role of administrators. We (because, even if I appear to be a traitor to my class, I am through and through an arts administrator) are vilified for doing nothing and being paid too much for nothing.
There is a serious problem when a board, especially one at a remove from the artistic mission, dictates operating policy. To require success, measured in deficit reduction or audience size, for instance, is a reasonable charge to an executive, who will stand or fall on the result. To require success based on breaking a union is not a reasonable charge.
But not many months ago, a local Aspen official (for whom I feel much respect, apart from this), told a local group that non-profits whose administrators were paid more than, say, five figures, should not be supported, because talented management should serve for the public good of it. This is really the same reasoning that leads people to say that teachers shouldn't be paid much, since they do it for love. A non-profit operating at a world-class level, and such is the Atlanta Symphony, needs world-class administration.
Of course, it also needs world-class musicians, and that will and should also be a significant cost.
When non-profits are not led by philanthropists, but are guided by misapplications of business models, trouble is inevitable. A watchword in Atlanta is ""a sustainable business model,"" and that seems inevitably reasonable at first. But the heart of a great orchestra's business model should be an investment in great musicians and a belief in their work, supported by essential pillars of earned and contributed revenue. The flaw in Atlanta's business model is not the expense of great musicians, but rather the structure of revenue support. If its leadership does not believe they can persuade the community to support the orchestra, the answer may be as stark as losing the orchestra, or losing the leadership.
I was part of board meetings at a different major American orchestra that chose to have earnest debate on this very question: ""Do we really have to be this good?"" It was absolutely right to confront all opinions. The upshot was a strong new commitment to the role a first-class orchestra plays in a city committed to high-tech, medical, and academic industries.
There are two sides to this. To say that the orchestra must have 106 full-time positions at a nationally competitive salary, or 96, or 86, may or may not be right. To say that any compromise along this axis is the end of the orchestra is surely wrong. But it is the essence of the importance of a collective bargaining agreement that it should ensure the voice of the musicians in decisions about the size and scope of the organization.
In Detroit, as in Minneapolis, there were important voices saying that it didn't matter if leading musicians left the orchestra. To say that any loss of musicians decimates the orchestra would also be wrong. Orchestras are constantly renewing themselves, and even the most legendary players leave, and become part of a legendary history. But there is a fulcrum, and when too many are leaving, the seesaw flips with a vengeance. Robert Spano has had a particular genius for finding the best young brass players, and orchestras including the Chicago Symphony and the New York and Los Angeles Philharmonics have consistently recruited from Atlanta. This is a healthy thing for an orchestra in Atlanta's position. If the top young talent cannot be recruited, because they understand that Atlanta might no longer be the perfect place to incubate their skills, then something infinitely precious is being squandered.
It's hard to have faith that the leadership of the Woodruff Center understands any of this.
What is needed, in Atlanta and everywhere, is the recognition that all sides play a part. It's how philanthropy works -- a partnership, an investment, a shared good. It's how artistry works. Dare I say, it's how excellent management works. 
A lockout is an enforcement of silence. It doesn't work.

4,ARTS,Return of the Artisan?,"Phil Simon, ContributorSpeaker, author, professor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/return-of-the-artisan_b_6049790.html,"The digital revolution in music has always faced outspoken critics. Some have complained about harsh digital sound. Many lament illegal downloads.

Some have complained about harsh digital sound. Many lament illegal downloads. These days, musicians protest paltry revenue from streaming sites like Pandora.
Fortunately for dedicated listeners, some of these critics are also famous artists who seek to deliver a more engaging experience. Count Steven Wilson among them. Yes, we live in an age of overwhelming quantity, but sound quality often suffers. Examples include HBO's new mini-series Sonic Highways. It follows Foo Fighters as they make a new album in America's most revered recording studios. The ""Ultra LP"" version of Jack White's new album Lazaretto rethinks the way that music is pressed on vinyl.
You may have heard of these folks, but what about lesser-known artists? I'm talking about those who can't afford camera crews, large studios, and vinyl pressings? Is there a way for them to provide their audience with the same experience?
John Roccesano, known to friends as Johnny Rock, is a 32-year-old drummer and project studio owner in northern New Jersey. His new album, Johnny Rock & Friends: For The Record, takes an ensemble cast of unsigned talent and gets them into the grooves of a full-length LP. Roccesano recorded and mixed the album over two years on analog tape, and the entire process is documented in a series of in-depth YouTube videos.
I sat down with him recently to talk about the process. 
PS: When and why did you launch For The Record?
JR: In 2012 I was getting really into playing vinyl records and researching everything I could about them. I've been on Steve Hoffman's Music Forum for years, which gave me a fantastic primer on vinyl, and also influenced me to buy different versions of the same albums for comparison. My friend and now co-producer Jonathan Bross and I would compare analog and digital recordings at his studio with critical ears (analog always sounded better). That's the kind of audience I had in mind when we started - people who care just as much about sound quality as they care about the music.
I learned that an all-analog album is actually very rare to produce. Very few mastering studios in the world today can cut a lacquer without first converting the source tape to digital. My friends are fantastic local musicians, and I knew most had never been recorded on 2-inch tape, let alone had their music pressed on vinyl. So I conceived a new album that could provide the analog experience to my friends, and together we could all make it onto a vinyl record.
What are you doing to drum up interest?
JR: We've just launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the manufacturing process and take pre-orders. More than that, last year I launched a YouTube channel that gives viewers an immersive experience. My two main features have been Artist Spotlights, where I interview most of our main cast about their musical journeys and how we all connect. Then there are videos which explore each song's conception and all the stages it went through in the studio. I've recorded over 60 hours of footage, so these videos will continue even after the record arrives in 2015.
PS: Unlike most compilation albums, yours is not a promotional record. It's an artistic one. Do you think it can find an audience without an accompanying live act?
JR: Well it's really not a ""compilation"" album, it's actually a ""collaboration"" album. The submissions were admittedly unrelated, but they were then arranged, recorded, and sequenced to be cohesive. As for a live adaptation, a live public concert is entirely feasible with a small group of us. But it would certainly be limited, and that's why I'm making such an expansive online universe that includes all of us. I think as long as we can keep our respective fan bases engaged and as long as they like the music, we can reach more people. By the way, we are offering private concerts in one of our Kickstarter rewards.
PS: What were the challenges you faced with analog recording?
The artists had to be present in a recording studio, lest a tape machine end up in their home. The limitations of the medium force you to think differently as well. There's a song on the record I co-wrote with my cousin Meagan, who lives over a thousand miles away in south Florida. I booked a recording studio there in March and flew down, but when my plane landed I had a voicemail from the studio saying their tape machine was broken. Everywhere else I looked didn't get back to me in time or was too expensive. But rather than cop-out and use a digital rig, we just scheduled another trip. So I went back in August with a cassette machine and we recorded in her dad's living room. People told me I was crazy for not doing that digitally, or that doing it on cassette was senseless. But I didn't care - I wanted a live performance caught on tape, and we did it.
PS: Do you think that digital recording and distribution is a blessing or a curse?
JR: Digital recording (on computers, not digital tape) is absolutely a blessing. It's much more versatile, practical, affordable, and portable. I find it lacking that extra bigness that tape adds, but it's still really good. Some people misuse or overuse the options available in digital recording, but others make it sound beautiful, so I'll take the bad with the good. Digital delivery on the other hand is awfully paradoxical. It seems miraculous to have so much content just a click away, but the quality is usually bad, if not terrible. We have immediate access to a worldwide audience, but get lost in a bombardment of information.
I co-wrote a song on the record called ""Window To The World"" about the paradox of technological advancements. I half-sarcastically sing ""We can buy and sell the tangible things / We can buy and sell our dreams / Or we can steal it all with style and with ease / We're really ghosts in the machine."" We've come a ways since the days of Napster, but the bottom line is most music ends up somewhere for free now; it's a given. And now that everything's free, nothing seems special.
PS: And yet vinyl record sales have increased every year since 2007. Why do you suppose that is?
I'd like to think it's because people had the same experience I did. I had some records laying around for years and I finally decided to get a turntable and play them. The experience was really great, and so I bought more records, old and new. Records sonically and visually have an allure about them, as does analog recording. The sales increases don't surprise me.
PS: What's been the greatest thrill of this experience?
It hasn't happened yet I'm sure. The greatest thrill will be watching a record spin on my turntable that my friends and I made. Now was the right time to do it, because it is prohibitively expensive for most working class musicians. And this technology won't be here forever; the machines in use are almost all from the 20th century. I call this project ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,"" because at the rate the old studios and true craftsmen are closing shop, it is.

Gruessing's direction for the Norris Center for the Performing Arts, ""The Drowsy Chaperone"", written by Bob Martin and Don McKellar, with music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison, is a spectacular production. It's funny and wistful. It's vibrant and extravagant. And it's guaranteed to wipe a frown off any face. Its costumes, songs, and dances reflect the stylish look and larger than life feel of the Roaring Twenties. They also capture its rhythm and verve.

The ensemble cast is outlandish. It includes frantic Robert's best man George (Chris Daniels) and Janet's bibulous Drowsy Chaperone (Tracy Lore). They face the impossible task of keeping groom and bride on track. There's Broadway producer Mr. Feldzieg (Greg Nicholas). He wants to stop the marriage lest two Gangsters (Jon M. Wailin and Adam Trent) fill him full of lead. There's aspiring actress Kitty (Noelle Marion), who wants to take Janet's place on Broadway. There's the ludicrous Latin lover Adolpho (Jeff Max). He doesn't cuckold Robert but sure made someone happy. There's the long-suffering house staff, Mrs. Tottendale (Lindsay Brooks) and the Underling (Danny Michaels). And, because you can't have a Roaring Twenties Musical without an aviatrix, there's Trix (Lindsey Martin). 

Then there's Raben's Walter Mitty-esque Man. His is the most spectacular performance in an evening full of spectacular performances. For most of the production, he's flamboyant, impassioned, and opinionated. Raben nails the contrast between the Man's vivid imagination and his dull, house mouse life. When he soars, he's infectious, hilarious, and affectionate. You can hear it in his voice. You can see it in his gestures and the way he moves around the room to watch the story. But when life, in the person of a building superintendent coming to fix a fuse, interrupts his rapture, he shuts down. It's like watching someone cycle through a bipolar episode. The effect is chilling.
 ""The Drowsy Chaperone"" is a love letter to musical theatre. With spot-on casting and evocative staging, it shows how musical theatre can transform a daily grind into a breezy love story. Just like the Man in the Chair, we become enchanted spectators, at least until we have to leave.
Performances are 8pm, Friday and Saturday, 2pm, Sunday. The show runs until May 11. Tickets are $45 adults and $25 children 12 and under. The Center is located at 27570 Norris Center Drive, Rolling Hills Estates, 90274. For more information, call (310) 544-0403 or visit www.norriscenter.com.

6,ARTS,Learning to Live Outside Your Comfort Zone,"George Heymont, ContributorSan Francisco-based arts critic",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/learning-to-live-outside_b_8907746.html,Children can be remarkably resilient. But what about adults who struggle to cope with the demands of their personal and professional lives? Will they happily go with the flow of new-found freedoms and technology? Or will they dig in their heels and resist change with the angry determination of a frightened adolescent?,2016-01-03,ARTS & CULTURE,"Fifty years ago I spent my summers working in a YMCA sailing camp on Point Judith Pond. Each summer brought distinct demonstrations of people being forced to live outside their comfort zone. 
It wasn't just the youngest campers who sulked and cried because they were homesick. Often it was teenage boys who, instead of wanting to be with their parents, wanted to watch television or missed the family's dog. There were always several campers who had never had a chance to go swimming in their lives and were terrified of the water. After listening to their terrified screams, two members of the waterfront staff would usually pick one of these kids up in their arms, walk him out into the shallow water, and let go. By the end of their stay at camp, you couldn't drag those kids out of the water. Then, of course, there were the doting helicopter mothers who ""just happened"" to bake too many brownies or cook too many spare ribs and felt compelled to drive 45 miles (and navigate a dangerous dirt road) to deliver the food to their son. The staff gleefully gobbled up such contraband.
The child who learns to rise to a challenge will often embrace a new experience with open arms. Conversely, the child who is taught to fear change will have to be dragged kicking and screaming into new environments and unfamiliar situations. Some will insist on eating at McDonald's while traveling abroad. Others will choose a more determined pathway to the future.

During the initial stages of World War II's shameful internment of Japanese-Americans, GeorgeTakei's family was taken from their middle-class home to the Santa Anita racetrack in Arcadia, California (which had become a designated holding place for families while an internment camp was being built). Takei recalls that:
We were housed in the horse stables. Can you imagine, for my parents to be taken from a two-bedroom home in Los Angeles, with their three children, and to sleep in this smelly horse stall? For my parents, it was degrading, dehumanizing; it was a horrible experience. But my memory is that it was fun. As a five-year-old kid, I thought 'I get to sleep where the horsies sleep! I can even smell them!' 
How a child reacts to a stressful situation depends on what s/he learns from parents, family, friends and teachers. Consider the way this Parisian father explained the November 15 terrorist attacks to his young son.

Children can be remarkably resilient. But what about adults who struggle to cope with the demands of their personal and professional lives? Will they happily go with the flow of new-found freedoms and technology? Or will they dig in their heels and resist change with the angry determination of a frightened adolescent?

The New Conservatory Theatre Center recently presented the West Coast premiere of The Kid Thing. Written by Sarah Gubbins and powerfully directed by Becca Wolff, the play depicts the growing tensions between two middle class lesbian couples living in Chicago.

Nate (Jaq Nguyen Victor) is a young, baby butch dyke who dresses like a skater boy and is eager for her partner to have a child. Nate's enthusiasm is matched by her naivete and periodic inability to hold onto a job. Margo (Kimberly Ridgeway) is Nate's older, wiser, and much wealthier partner who doesn't mind being pregnant as long as she can make Nate happy by bringing a child into the world.

Leigh (Sarah Coykendall) is the kind of control freak who makes the overly ambitious Tracy Flick (from 1999's Election) seem like she's on Quaaludes. Competitive, impulsive, self-involved, easily obsessed by an idea, and achingly insecure, Leigh's modus operandi is basically ""Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!"" Watching her nervously offer several flavors of gelato to her dinner guests (or a drink to her former college classmate) is a case study in frenzied overcompensation. Darcy (Desiree Rogers) is Leigh's partner. When the couple first met, they had very little income. But when Darcy got a job with a high-powered public relations firm, she ended up working long hours wooing corporate clients (which often left Leigh's insecurities spinning out of control at home). While Darcy has an admirable amount of patience for some of Leigh's antics, she does not like to be railroaded into a project.
What starts out as a friendly dinner party where Darcy is handling the background music while the others are cattily dishing about Michael Jackson takes a sharp turn when Nate and Margo inform their hosts that they are expecting a baby. Leigh soon becomes determined to become pregnant using the same sperm donor that Margo used -- a former college classmate of Leigh's and Nate's named Jacob (Nick Mandracchia).

By the end of Act I, two things have become painfully clear:
Leigh and Nate are trying to set Darcy up for a meeting with Jacob in the hope that both couples can share the same sperm donor. Margo and Darcy have been having an affair behind Leigh and Nate's backs.

Kimberly Ridgeway (Margo) and Desiree Rogers (Darcy) in a scene from The Kid Thing (Photo by: Lois Tema) 
As Gubbins explains:
I wrote The Kid Thing in response to the question all childless women in their mid-thirties face: 'So, are you thinking about the kid thing?' Being a gay woman, the question seemed even more complicated. But this play was also a response to the deep questioning I observed from so many women on the brink of motherhood -- educated, middle-class, career-oriented, and partnered women wrestling with whether they had the resources to be parents. This play examines how gay individuals and couples make life-altering decisions and how ideas about child-raising are often exacerbated by economic insecurities and internalized homophobia.
The underlying conflict in The Kid Thing is how much each of these women wants to become a parent. Nate is eager and optimistic; Margo is willing and able. Leigh is determined to the point of being ruthless. Darcy however, is surprisingly reluctant to join in the fun.
The reason for Darcy's fear of commitment turns out to be much more complex than her friends could ever have imagined. In addition to being an old school and very masculine dyke, Darcy's long work hours mean that Leigh would be saddled with most of the childcare responsibilities. The Utopian visions Leigh and Nate conjure up about the two families sharing the same sperm donor and being completely transparent with each other quickly set off Darcy's bullshit alarm.
When Darcy starts doing some sarcastic ""truth telling,"" the shit hits the fan. Deeply hurt by her behavior, Margo and Nate leave Darcy and Leigh's apartment in anger. Meanwhile, Leigh drops a bombshell on her partner, which effectively becomes the straw that breaks Darcy's back. Furious at Leigh's betrayal, Darcy leaves the apartment in a near-speechless rage. At the end of the play, Leigh is alone, possibly pregnant, and very much the unintentional victim of her manipulative tactics.
Under Becca Wolff's direction, NCTC's ensemble did a superb job of riding the ebb and flow of emotions which had little, if anything, to do with maternal instinct. They were helped by James Ard's sound design and Emily Ann Holtzclaw's costumes.

Imagine, if you will, that Sheldon Cooper (the biggest nerd among the scientists in The Big Bang Theory) was reborn as a virginal Asian American college senior who was terrified of her vagina. An ardent online gamer with fearsome battle skills, Evie Malone (Monica Ho) earns her spending money by writing love letters for people who have broken up with their lovers and are hoping to get back together as well as advising those who wish to break up with their lover on the most effective ways to achieve their goal.
On paper and in theory, Evie is brilliant at what she does. But when it comes to interacting with real live human beings, she is completely lacking in basic social skills.

Custom Made Theatre is recently presented the Bay area premiere of Madhuri Shekar's riotously funny play, In Love and Warcraft, in a production that has been merrily directed by James Nelson. The production's opening night took place under strained circumstances because the company's lighting board had been stolen earlier that day and all of the show's lighting cues had to be reprogrammed into a borrowed lighting board. Working on Devin Kasper's unit set (with costumes by Brooke Jennings and sound design by Liz Ryder), the audience had no problem getting into the spirit of Shekar's farce. Opening night was [almost] ""all systems go"" from start to finish.
Although Ryan (Drew Reitz) may be Evie's online partner in their World of Warcraft guild, in real life he's an overgrown man-boy living in the basement of his parents' home. Like Evie, he assumes that World of Warcraft is more important than anything in real life. A unexpected change in Evie's life, however, suddenly changes all that.

Ryan (Drew Reitz) challenges Raul (Ed Berkeley) in a scene from In Love and Warcraft (Photo by: Jay Yamada) 
Unlike her roommate, Kitty (Laura Espino), Evie has no interest in touching people, especially if it could lead to sex. But when a new client shows up asking for help in getting back together with his girlfriend, he finds Evie incredibly attractive and asks her out to dinner. One thing leads to another and pretty soon, Evie and Raul (Ed Berkeley) are happily snuggling together and holding hands -- as long as there is no sex.

Raul (Ed Berkeley) and Evie (Monica Ho) embark on a platonic  relationship during In Love and Warcraft (Photo by: Jay Yamada) 
In her clueless approach to sexual desire, Evie tells Raul that since their relationship is strictly platonic, she understands that he might need to look elsewhere to fulfill his sexual needs. Raul, in turn, asks Evie to stop playing World of Warcraft and try to focus on life in the real world.

Evie (Monica Ho) gets a gynecological examination from a female physician (Amanda Farbstein) in a scene from  In Love and Warcraft (Photo by: Jay Yamada) 
One night, when Raul runs into a very drunk Kitty at a local bar and ends up driving her back to the apartment and having sex with her, Evie loses it. The only way for Kitty to win back her friend and for Raul to win back the woman he loves is to join Evie on her own turf: virtual reality. As Custom Made Theatre's artistic director, Brian Katz, explains:
The moment I heard about this play I immediately wanted to produce it. What's better than a rom-com that is absolutely current (set in the exploding world of online gaming), but also has its roots in classical comedy? Upon reading the script, it was easy to see Shekar is the real deal. Her dialogue sparkles, the situations she sets up are hysterical, and on top of that the play has real heart. The gaming world is just the skin in which this play is wrapped. Our director, James Nelson, has told his cast that in the end it is about intimacy, and I completely agree. I think everyone can relate to Evie's journey because she faces one of our greatest fears and, in trying to overcome it, finds what can be our greatest joy in life.

Evie (Monica Ho) dresses as her avatar as Kitty (Laura Espino) looks on in a scene from In Love and Warcraft (Photo by: Jay Yamada) 
Custom Made assembled a winning ensemble that, under James Nelson's direction, made the most of Shekar's hilarious script. From the scene in which Evie undergoes a gynecological examination (because she's convinced that her vagina stopped working) and experiences her first orgasm to the blossoming of Raul's character into a hot and hunky leading man who's not gay, but admits to occasionally liking to dress up, each character's individual journey was filled with sight gags and snarky dialogue. Monica Ho was a total delight as Evie and, in her scene with a male hair stylist (Sal Mattos), underwent a stunning yet highly comedic transformation.
Although Laura Espino did a fine job as the hypersexual Kitty, I was most impressed with Ed Berkeley's performance as Raul. An extremely hot and hunky actor, he is a welcome addition to the Bay area's theatre community.

7,ARTS,The Wack Donald's Project,"Jaime Rojo & Steven Harrington, ContributorCo-Founders, BrooklynStreetArt.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wack-donalds-project-_b_5195124.html,,2014-04-23,ARTS & CULTURE,"The actual street and the digital version of it are now intrinsically linked and often if you see new occurrences of street art it takes just a bit of searching online to find out more about the artist and what they are up to. This week we were surprised to find these posters that incorporate Ronald McDonald into their messaging, and to find out how they appear to be marketed just as thoroughly through social media online.
It's all about the subtleties of course, and many street artists leave a breadcrumb of clues digitally to lead you to their work on the street or in the gallery or on a t-shirt. And everyone is familiar with large ""urban"" brands that traverse the transgressive vibe through adroit social messaging that invariably leads to a product you may purchase. Nonetheless, sometimes it gets very confusing.
 Mr. OneTeas (photo © Jaime Rojo)
A French illustrator/painter/graphic designer from Nice who also has had shows in galleries in Monaco, Mr OneTeas is known to some as a graffiti artist who samples pop culture on his canvasses and appropriates commonly recognizable images of Hollywood names like Liz Taylor, Princess Grace, and Alfred Hitchcock. He also presents 80s television culture ironically (spotlighting Gary Coleman, Alf, Mr. T), inverts meanings with global brand logos, critiques consumerist culture, and interprets his subjects using the visual language of street art and the commercial finesse of artists such as Mr. Brainwash, for example.
 Mr. OneTeas (photo © Jaime Rojo)
That said, some people on the street here have been intrigued by these posters with the Mr OneTeas name on them which have popped up on street walls around Brooklyn appearing to skewer the fast food giant and consumerism - both because it has been a little while since we've seen a satirical bashing of a world brand on the street and because mroneteas appears to be so publicly documenting it on his Instagram and Facebook page.
If you consider the artist name as a brand (for the sake of argument), this is culture-jamming that is being re-jammed; a guerilla-advertising campaign-style series of postering that attacks a huge brand and is critical of consumerism which then employs common social media advertising techniques of promotion to get its message out. Is this still détournement?
In a brief email interview with the artist we learned that ""The Wack Donald's Project"" began in 2011 when he first merged the Mona Lisa with Ronald McDonald. Influenced by the documentary ""Supersize Me,"" Mr OneTeas says that his illustrations began to equate the ubiquity of the friendly clown in the minds of children as something far more sinister than he originally thought.
 Mr. OneTeas (photo © Jaime Rojo)
""McDonald's use Ronald the clown and they made him so friendly and attractive for the children customers,"" he says. Describing the piece entitled, ""Ronald's Daughter / My Father Is A Terrorist,"" the artist says, ""Today we all are scared about terrorism, suspecting everybody around us, but no one is suspecting McDonalds to hurt us. We've been conditioned by it because we have grown up with it, and now if you're looking at the Mc D restaurant world map, you will be surprised that they are everywhere.""
He says he started his campaign last month in Prague and this month he was in New York with five more posters. But the New York campaign was just a small one. ""100 different Wack Donald's characters are waiting to pop up, each one chosen for special reasons for different countries."" You can expect the social campaign will also follow the postering campaign closely because Mr OneTeas considers the fast food to be on par with tobacco. ""On the cigarette packs in France you can read 'Smoking Kills'. My thoughts are that I would like to make people realize that eating junk food can kill as well,"" he says.
Guess we'll just have to follow his Instagram to see how the campaign progresses.

8,ARTS,Everything You Need To Know About Mike Kelley,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-kelley-moca_n_5065789.html,,2014-05-03,ARTS & CULTURE,"At long last, Mike Kelley's gargantuan retrospective has come to Los Angeles, and in case you haven't yet seen the overwhelming display of fuzzy friends, wonky low-budget films, aggressive drawings and dizzying installations, we'll warn you: it's quite an overwhelming experience. Around 20 new pieces have been added to the exhibition since its stay at MoMA PS1 in New York. And, like so many who journey from the East Coast to the West, the works have room to stretch.

Sprawled across the massive space of MOCA's Geffen Contemporary in Downtown LA, Kelley's works forge a topsy-turvy landscape that resembles an alternate Los Angeles with all your fears and fantasies made flesh. Divided into self-contained pockets, not all too unlike the disparate components of the city, Kelley's exhibition features a nearly endless variety of media, ideas, styles and affects. Viewers go from a bubbling vault of mythical Superman utopias into a rainbow tunnel that leads to the artwork of a local murderer. Reactions fizzle with a visceral heat, the art as tangible inside as your morning's breakfast;; this is not a show you stroll calmly through.
Kelley moved to California from his hometown of Detroit, Michigan in 1976, to study art at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts). He lived and worked in LA for over 35 years, his work mirroring in many ways the fractured persona of the city -- a suburban replica of a metropolis, dressed up yet shattered, utterly unapologetic. His artwork branched in infinite directions of style and technique, while often returning to themes of sexuality, shame, childhood, memory, and the monstrous inside. Throughout his career, Kelley revealed the always lurking proximity of blue collar tastes and the avant-garde, innocence and perversion, the banal and the absurd, the bedroom and the nightmare. Behind every pair of tattered stuffed animals in flagrante delicto, there's an idea hungry for a new mind to infiltrate. When he committed suicide two years ago at 57 years old, Kelley had become one of Los Angeles' most influential and experimental artists. His legacy is everywhere, from the current crop of art school grads to the shiny displays at the 99 Cent Store.
If you're in the LA area, Kelley's retrospective is a must. To relieve you of some of the delicious burden ahead, we've provided a timeline of our favorite Kelley works. Enjoy.
Mike Kelley's retrospective runs until July 28, 2014 at The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA in Los Angeles.

9,ARTS,'Portrait Of A Quiet Girl' Celebrates The Private Madness Within Us All,Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/portrait-of-a-quiet-girl-_n_7673906.html,,2015-06-29,ARTS & CULTURE,"What are your secret single behaviors? In the season 4 episode of “Sex and the City,” “The Good Fight,” Carrie Bradshaw reveals that when she’s home alone, she makes a stack of saltine crackers with grape jelly and eats them standing up in the kitchen while reading fashion magazines -- not the most shocking habit, but certainly a bit unexpected. 
In a photo series called “Portrait of a Quiet Girl,” artist Chrissie White, in collaboration with Elvia Carreon, zooms in on our secret solitary habits, in all their weird, quirky glory. 
The series, first published in The Photographic Journal, might at first seem to be a surrealist take on mental illness; in fact, White has cited “The Yellow Wallpaper” by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, a story about isolation-induced madness, as an inspiration for the project. 
In an email to The Huffington Post, however, White explained that the photos are not necessarily meant to show a mental health condition, but rather the freedom shy people can find to be fully themselves within the safety of their own homes. “Others might see this women as being mentally unstable,” said White of the “slightly agoraphobic” character she created with Carreon. “But she enjoys her solitude and finds comfort in her home where she can play without fear of judgement.”
Though introverts typically shy from the spotlight, introversion has enjoyed a wave of public attention following the publication of Susan Cain's book on introverts, Quiet. Self-identified introverts have eagerly shared listicles like 23 Signs You're Secretly An Introvert and celebrated the recognition that needing plenty of time alone or being uncomfortable in huge groups doesn’t necessarily make you flawed -- just different. 
“Portrait of a Quiet Girl” goes a step beyond, celebrating “how strange and unreserved people can be when they aren't being watched,” as White put it. The series invites us to think of our own odd, solitary behaviors from a new distance, confronting us with the reality that we all might look a little absurd if outsiders could see how we act when we are totally alone. “I believe that everyone has some ‘quirks’ that could be diagnosed as illness,” said White. “People are just really good at hiding them when they are out in public.”
If, as the Cheshire Cat told Alice, we’re all mad here, in our own safe, unwatched spaces, the meaning of “madness” becomes far less cut-and-dry. In “Portrait of a Quiet Girl,” White and Carreon invite us to question what we think of as mad, and to embrace the kaleidoscopic range of quirks and emotions we all experience as humans.

Ending an amorous relationship with an often clichéd string of characters through the internet or a mobile phone ia about as impersonal and anti-romantic as it gets. Artist Allison L. Wade explores the bizarre and ubiquitous practice with a bright and biting series entitled ""It's Not You."" The artworks explore the awkward space where the infinite ether meets your intimate parting words -- be they poetic, overdramatic or borderline deranged. 

Wade takes inspiration from texts she's received in dissolving relationships, from rom rom-com ready lines like, ""I knew you would do this to me"" to more bizarre gems like, ""WTF!!! YOU LEFT FOR IBIZA WITHOUT ME"" and ""ON ZANAX AT THE AIRPORT HAD A PANIC ATTACK PLEASE STOP CALLING ME"". She juxtaposes these profound textual snippets with a variety of backdrops -- from solid, bright colors to psychedelic washes to color print test patterns -- each in some way conveying the cold and empirical nature of technologically-assisted communication.

""With the paintings I want the viewer to feel a mixture of feelings but mainly irony,"" Wade explained to The Huffington Post Arts. ""I really want the viewer to discover through humor a universal recognition and the absurdity of how we shield ourselves with technology.""
Somewhere between the Platonic ideal of the perfect breakup and the awkward reality that often must suffice, Wade's dry artworks capture the bizarre status of romance in the digital age. Through electric colors and awkward stock imagery, Wade showcases the peculiar state of contemporary romance -- simultaneously made all the more readily available by technology and, in some ways, impossible. 
""It's Not You"" runs from November 6 to January 10, 2015 at Rick Wester Fine Art in New York. Get a preview of the works below.

This year that wasn't so. My opinions haven't changed since the announcements.",2014-05-20,ARTS & CULTURE,"I've been getting a lot of calls in the last few weeks asking me what I thought of the Tony nominations. Often I am surprised with something right as the nominations come out, but, upon reflection, my surprise changes to understanding. This year that wasn't so. My opinions haven't changed since the announcements.
My reactions are few, but I'll share them with you en masse.
Aladdin's design team got robbed. I believe Natasha Katz, Gregg Barnes and Bob Crowley all should have received nominations. Yet not one got one? This would be more easily understandable to me had the show garnered no nods -- then I would consider their omission part of a backlash. But here the musical received a nod as Best Musical and even one for its book (which I found meh). Who thought Howell Binkley's After Midnight lighting was better than Natasha Katz's Aladdin work? That show rises and falls on its look -- the magical cartoon landscape created is what makes the production. I believe Katz, Barnes and Crowley all deserved to be singled out.
The Best Revival of a Musical category was just as I would have picked it, as my readers know. So I was happy with that one. Someone on Talkin Broadway wondered why this battle was important to me. In a world where we are constantly debating the importance of critics and awards, the Tony Awards still mean a good deal. Yes, not every show needs a nomination to propel it. There are those with winning names or marquee talent that sell themselves. But it can be significant to smaller shows. As a community, we should support creativity. We should want to help new productions. That is why I believe re-mountings of revivals should not be eligible.
Yay, Anika Larsen and Jarrod Spector! I was rooting for them, but neither of them were definite.
I must have seen an off performance of After Midnight. I didn't get Adriane Lenox's performance and neither did the crowd the night I saw it. When I was there, it was all about the trio of ladies and the tappers (and of course Fantasia). Lenox's numbers really didn't get any squeals. So I am surprised at that nomination. Marin Mazzie deserved it more, in my mind.
I was very pleasantly surprised by the nomination of Mare Winningham. I am still upset she didn't win an Oscar for her performance in Georgia.
Of course the real story, as Michael Riedel will keep reminding us, was Realistic Joneses being omitted from the nominations. Most of my calls ask me to weigh in on that in particular. I liked Realistic Joneses more than many. I was happy I saw it. I think it had a unique point-of-view, one worthy of being heard. However I was not surprised that it didn't garner any nominations. As a play, it turned many people off. (I wrote down reactions of some folks coming out, most of which were hilarious.) The performances were all solid, but I didn't leave thinking any actor was a shoo-in. I wouldn't have been surprised if it did receive nominations. I just also was not very surprised by this outcome.
As we enter the Tony Awards, many categories, including the two big ones, remain up-for-grabs. It is an odd season without clear front-runners. It will be interesting to see what happens on Tony night. Tune in June 8.

Remarkably, memories from years gone by keep surfacing -- like this long-cherished memory of an evening in Los Angeles during November, 1980.
There I was, sitting in a gay bar in West Hollywood, watching the sun set over the Pacific Design Center. The arbiters of taste flocked from the Blue Whale to The Blue Parrot in droves. Most looked tired, a bit jaded, and anxious to get home.
But I was on edge. I was about to embark on the maiden voyage of the greatest ocean liner ever built by man. When a faux cowboy leaned over and whispered in my ear ""Don't forget yer Mae West in case the ship sinks,"" I couldn't decide if he was referring to my swell set of knockers or the fact that buoyancy is my middle name. That night -- as I drowned in the icy waters off UCLA -- proved to be better than any ride in Disneyland. I loved every minute of it.

Wilhelm Dieter Siebert was a composer with a strong background as a jazz clarinetist. When his audience participation opera, The Sinking of the Titanic, had its world premiere at the Deutsche Oper Berlin on September 6, 1979, the work won raves for its production values even if it garnered less ecstatic notices for Siebert's score.
I happened to like Siebert's music more than most. It possessed a tacky quality which suited the occasion to a ""T"" (as in Titanic). In many ways, his opera served as a rude jab at the social customs of pre-World War I aristocracy. Together with Christian Rateuke and Hartmann Schmige, Siebert had crafted a libretto that transformed the RMS Titanic's ill-fated maiden voyage into a fierce commentary on a class society ruled by socioeconomic swindling.

Siebert's opera received its American premiere as part of the festivities celebrating the 200th birthday of the city of Los Angeles. The production was the real star of the show. The Sinking of the Titanic began outside Royce Hall as steerage passengers (chorus) sang of their hopes for a better life in the New World. Following the launching ceremony, the audience boarded the Titanic using gangplanks placed over the steps outside the auditorium (chorus members were brutally shoved off the First Class gangway).

Once inside the auditorium, the opera unfolded in several different playing areas: Promenade Deck, First Class Cabin, the Bridge, the wireless cabin, and the caged quarters for the Titanic's steerage passengers.
Halfway through the evening, the audience was invited to join the ship's ball in the Grand Salon (onstage). After a terrible crash was heard, the real fun began. The audience's trek (through wreckage, down smoke-filled stairs, over bleeding bodies, past strobe lights, wind machines, and screaming steerage passengers) was a fantastic accomplishment by director Winfried Bauernfeind.
As Second Class passengers (the audience) waited in the ""icy waters"" beside Royce Hall's loading dock, the President of the White Star Line forced his way into a lifeboat (J. Bruce Ismay's behavior was rudely booed as only a villain deserved). The lifeboat eventually left the side of the ship (Royce Hall) and was drawn through the crowd at eye level. Meanwhile, members of the chorus worked their way through the audience as the vocal ghosts of those who had drowned, providing a chilling contrast to Lady Astor's final monologue (sung atop a forklift).

For those, like myself, who are ocean liner fanatics, the opera was great fun. Here was a chance to relive history by participating in one of its most legendary maritime disasters. The experience also served to fulfill some outrageous fantasies. When all those freshly scrubbed sailors kept putting their arms around me and directing me to the Boat Deck, my fingers began to twitch with the desire to return their embrace. However, unable to find any indications in the score for groping the crew, I decided to cooperate with the orderly evacuation of the doomed White Star liner (popularly hailed as ""the ship that God himself could not sink"").
The cast had a perfectly seedy time onstage. As Denver society's ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown, Dorothea Weiss looked like a porky little version of Renata Scotto as she attempted to strike up a feeble conversation with Benjamin Guggenheim in her aria ""Art is so exciting, isn't it?"" Guggenheim and John Jacob Astor IV were more concerned with the relationships between art and money. David Knutson shone as the singing and tap-dancing Second Officer Charles H. Lightoller. William Dooley acted as a dramatic catalyst in the role of reporter Frank Holloway. Molly Brown's maid (Vera Little-Augustithis) did a grand spiritual/vaudeville turn as ""one of America's real live Negro women.""
The Sinking of the Titanic was one of the most exciting theatrical experiences I can remember. The mixture of reliving history in the form of an audience participation opera proved to be a grand thrill. If there's ever a performance in the Bay area, I'd gladly drown again for the sake of art!

Those who work as museum docents and tour guides have absorbed such a wealth of information about their subject that they cannot wait to share their knowledge with others. However, when audiences are unresponsive, they can become irritated and may try to provoke a question and answer session.

Many years ago, a man who narrated sightseeing bus tours of San Francisco told me about the day he became so frustrated that he decided to play a trick on his audience to see if they were actually listening to him. As the group stood atop the scenic outlook on Twin Peaks, he waved his arm toward the Bay, indicating where they would find the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and Alcatraz.
Then, without missing a beat, he said ""Over there is Angel Island. Angel Island used to be one of the Hawaiian Islands, but it was towed here last year and is on its way to Arizona."" No one dared to challenge him.

If you've taken a sightseeing tour lately (or visited a major museum), you may have noticed that many of the dedicated tour guides who tried so hard to entertain and educate their audiences have been replaced by rentable digital devices that can provide audio tours in several languages without any need to worry about scheduling people to share their knowledge and enthusiasm with curious travelers.

What has gone missing is the passion of the decent docent (a unique variable that can range from scholarly lectures to impassioned diatribes by cult-like art worshippers who have finally found a venue in which they can shine).
Imagine an aspiring actor who freezes at auditions but blossoms when leading small groups through an art collection; someone whose wounded ego craves the social validation that comes with informing others about so much that they could never have possibly known.  Imagine a performer who, stripped of his props and narrative, might very well be a lonely introvert whose backstory lacks anything as rewarding as his day job.  Imagine a man of no importance in his private life who nevertheless thrives when given a chance to impart historical gossip to an audience preconditioned to believe every word he utters.
Working with the folks at ZSpace, Bay area playwright Peter Sinn Nachtreib recently premiered a 90-minute piece of immersive theatre which defies all rules and is guaranteed to offend those who need to be offended. A House Tour of the Infamous Porter Family Mansion With Tour Guide Weston Ludlow Londonderry takes its audience of approximately 50 guests on an adventure few will find easy to forget.

Written for Danny Scheie (a Bay area actor with great comic timing and a gift for taking matters over the top and far beyond), House Tour allows its protagonist (a somewhat manic man whose self importance comes from his proximity to the great wealth that was once lavished on sordid lives and tacky objects) to alternately charm, browbeat, and befuddle his charges as he guides them through an environment designed by Sean Riley and lit by Drew Yerys, with sound design by Madeleine Oldham.
The house in question is the former home of Hubert and Clarissa Porter, a fabulously wealthy and decidedly eccentric couple whose laboratory of sexual athletics has been memorialized in a glass case display of ""The Stick of Butter That Changed Everything."" As the playwright explains:
""Equality is not the same thing as being the same as everyone else. This play is a celebration of abnormality. A tribute to those who find joy in acts others find shameful. A salute to those who will never be able to fit into any 'new normal' (nor would they want to if they could). Being a playwright in residence here for the past three years has allowed me to take some big risks and push outside my own box of tricks. I loved being able to write something specifically for this enormous venue and to write something specifically for the brilliant actor, Danny Scheie. I hope this piece, in some small way, has stirred your own inner misfit and instilled it with power. May we all have a secret room.""
While Nachtreib's perversely hilarious script wastes no time embracing the absurd, it takes a professional ham like Danny Scheie to do it justice. Scheie deliver his lines with the proper amount of acid-tinged condescension while dropping gossipy morsels about the social horrors inflicted on Hubert and Clarissa after their diaries were stolen and made public (Hubert religiously recorded every detail of every orgasm). Add in Scheie's in-your-face glee as he layers his descriptions of various, bizarre objects d'art with multiple layers of sexual innuendo and you'll understand why this particular house tour stands in a class all its own.
Whether being herded into a bathroom to enjoy ""lotion and cookies"" or being encouraged to ""stroke the walls"" in order to get the full experience of the Porter Family Mansion, Scheie's mercurial tour guide ricochets between fawning worship and caustic bullying as he leads his charges around the many rooms of the Porter Family Mansion in a bravura solo performance.

If I can offer one suggestion to director Jason Eagan, it would be to allow more seating in the various rooms as some audience members have difficulty standing for long periods of time. This particularly applies to the pivotal sequence following the ""lotion and cookies"" experience. One can only hope and pray for frequent revivals of Nachtreib's tour de force. Perhaps it should be called a ""tour de farce.""

The San Francisco Playhouse has moved performances of its Sandbox Series of new works to the Rueff Theatre (a black box performance space above American Conservatory Theatre's newly-restored Strand Theatre on Market Street). As part of the National New Play Network's ""Rolling World Premieres"" program, the company recently staged Steven Dietz's prickly hostage drama entitled On Clover Road with the audience seated on opposite sides of the playing area.

The play begins with a nervous confrontation in a seedy room at an abandoned motel. Kate (Sally Dana) is a desperate and emotionally exhausted woman whose 14-year-old daughter ran off to join a cult several years ago. She has come to the motel in the hope that Stine (Michael Storm) can rescue her Jessica from the grip of the cult's charismatic leader, a former insurance salesman.
Stine, however, needs to toughen Kate up until she is ready to be face the challenges of being reunited with a daughter who, having been severely brainwashed, is likely to reject her. As a private investigator, he's also uncovered some critical facts that Kate has kept secret. The most important one is that Jessica's grandparents had set up a trust in her name which only Jessica could access after she turned 18. That birthday is fast approaching.

From the very beginning of Dietz's play, one senses that there are plenty of loose threads to this story. Not only was Kate far from an ideal mother (she had a tendency toward heavy drinking), she never once attempted a background check to see if Stine was legit. Stine's story about how he holds the cult leader responsible for his daughter's death (and the collapse of his marriage) might be true. And then again, it might not. As the company's artistic director, Bill English, explains:
""What really made me jump at the chance to produce On Clover Road was not so much the fact that it is a thriller (which I love) or that it delves into the scary world of cults, runaways, and deprogramming (which are hot topics), but the way Steve Dietz portrays the power of a mother's love and the super-human lengths to which a mother will go to protect her child. When I first read On Clover Road, it reminded me of The Mothers, by Farley Mowat. Not a thriller, but an account of the Donner Party that accurately portrays the truth that, amidst all of the horror of that winter, it was the mothers who brought through the survivors. They made decisions and performed the impossible when the men were running uselessly around in the snow.Perhaps a mother's love is the most potent force in life. I hadn't read another account of motherly love as powerful until On Clover Road came my way. It is, of course, a thriller, with twists and turns, revelations and shocks, and the important themes of how children can be seduced by the power of cult leaders and how desperate parents can resort to the morally questionable act of kidnapping them back. But in the end, On Clover Road is most powerfully the story of a mother, and what a tortuous journey she is willing to take to recover her daughter.""

Directed by Susi Damilano, On Clover Road depicts a fierce tug of war between the forces of innocence/naivete and corruption/evil. Working on a unit set designed by Jacquelyne Scott (with fight choreography by Mike ""Miguel"" Martinez), the drama was sufficiently intense to have two women in the audience moaning ""No! No!"" as the pressure started to mount.

I tip my hat to Damilano and her ensemble, who managed to sustain a growing sense of despair and terror with solid acting. In addition to Michael Storm and Sally Dana, the cast included Adam Elder as the slick, manipulative cult leader and Nancy Kimball and Rachel Goldberg as two of the teenage girls who had fallen into his clutches.

14,ARTS,First Nighter: Rajiv Joseph's 'Guards at the Taj' Shocks Admirably,"David Finkle, ContributorWriter, Drama Critic",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/first-nighter-rajiv-josep_b_7575220.html,"What ensues may have some comic elements but, considering all that's preceded the Humayun-Babur activities, Joseph's Guards at the Taj is too morbid for non-stop yuks.",2015-06-13,ARTS & CULTURE,"A myth about the Taj Mahal goes that when it was completed as an Agra, India palace for Shah Jahan's wife -- who didn't live to see it -- the mogul had the hands of the 20,000 workmen cut off so they could never construct a building that might equal or surpass it in beauty.
There seems to be no historical substantiation for the tall tale -- or for the same claim about other sites from antiquity -- but the story is so colorful in its macabre way that it continues to be told. Just at the moment it's a good thing, too, because the imaginative playwright Rajiv Joseph has not only heard the time-honored story, he's constructed Guards at the Taj, a darkly mesmerizing play around the 17th-century occurrence, now at the Atlantic.
In it, he places Humayun (Omar Metwally) and Babur (Arian Moayed), both outfitted in smashing uniforms with flashing swords (Bobby Frederick Tilley II, the costumer), at a wall before dawn lights the just completed architectural phenomenon. (Timothy R. Mackabee designed the sets.) They're best friends, although Babur is compulsively talkative, while Humayun, the son of the Mughal Imperial Guard head, has been cowed by his demanding father into playing entirely by the book.
After Babur forces a waning wee hours chat about birds and also about the two men's hope some day to be assigned to the Shah's harem, Humayun mentions a rumor he's heard but refuses to pass along. Badgered by Babur, he relents and reveals the hands-severing plan. The mention not only disturbs the pair, but the thought strikes them that they could be the ones selected to do the massive slicing.
They got that right. When the wall behind them has been raised for the second scene, Humayun and Babur are awash in a cave where the floor is covered in blood-red water and large baskets brimming with hands sit. Humayun can't see, and Babur is unable to loosen his grip on his sword.
Though those immediate circumstances are temporary and Humayun and Babur are soon attempting to pass the time by cleaning up after the chopping (Babur) and cauterizing (Humayun) and talking (for longer than they need to dramatically) about various inventions -- a possible vehicle to the stars, a transportable hole through which to escape from tight predicaments -- Babur is unable to keep up the placid front.
He insists that in excising 40,000 artisans' hands he's killed beauty. He's curtailed the possibility for beauty ever again to appear in the world. Humayun disputes this, but Babur refuses to dismiss his concern. When the next scene starts with Humayun and Babur back at their posts, the two seem calmer and then even joyful when Humayun announces the efficient execution of their assignment has gotten them the harem slot they've wanted.
But excitement occupies them only briefly when Babur realizes that following the Shah inches behind him as he visits his women puts them in position to take revenge on him.
That's about the extent to which outlining the plot can go without spoiling the fun, though ""fun"" may be the wrong word here. What ensues may have some comic elements but, considering all that's preceded the Humayun-Babur activities, Joseph's Guards at the Taj is too morbid for non-stop yuks. There's no call to lay out the ensuing complications, except to say best friends Humayun and Babur become greatly at odds with each other.
What the playwright is up to as he elaborates on the intriguing myth by creating the story of Humayun and Babur is examining the wages of guilt. It's a theme that always has cogency and is certainly pressing as presented in this unexpected perspective.
Along with that he also weighs the pros and cons of following orders. Initially, Humayun feels no pain at his part in the horrifying plan, while Babur tries to push his task to the back of his mind but fails. Ultimately, however, Humayun's conscience doesn't seem as impervious to remorse as he'd like.
Amy Morton directed Moayed and Metwally, and none of the three recoiled from the script's demands. When on guard, Metwally and Moayed hold lengthy frozen poses -- until the characters can't resist turning to look at the just finished Taj Mahal. When Joseph requires Humayun and Babur to wade in the red-red water, Morton has them wallow. When Humayun and Babur become emotional, Metwally and Moayed are thoroughly prepared for that, too.
There's no possibility of declaring Guards at the Taj easy on the eyes, ears and spirit, but while the temptation to look away is strong, there's no likelihood of following through on the urge. Joseph is too clever for that.

""O Wagner, westward bring thy heavenly art, No trifler thou: Siegfried and Wotan be Names for big ballads of the modern heart. Thine ears hear deeper than thine eyes can see. Voice of the monstrous mill, the shouting mart, Not less of airy cloud and wave and tree, Thou, thou, if even to thyself unknown, Hast power to say the Time in terms of tone.""  --Sidney Lanier, 1877

In the years before the High Line emerged as the new epicenter of New York City's high culture, my sister Ellen and I were browsing in one of the West 22nd Street art galleries that foretold of West Chelsea's transfiguration from the meatpacking district and late-night gay cruising scene. The gallery's featured artist was someone neither of us had heard of. Ellen, an environmentalist and artist whose progressive politics are more discernible in her probing photography of the ordinary and downtrodden than in her watercolor landscapes with their subtle pastels, was pleased by what she was seeing. What did I think? Yes, I agreed, the paintings were sensual and abstractly appealing. But I felt I had to know more about the artist and the subject and context of the art before I could render an opinion. 
Dinner with Hilan Warshaw at Café Tallulah, a French bistro on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Warshaw is the creator of several music documentaries, including Wagner's Jews and Lyric Suite, a work-in-progress which tells the background story of Alban Berg's previously unknown affair with a Jewish woman and features a performance of the work with Renee Fleming and the Emerson String Quartet. Hilan and I are mostly on the same page about Wagner, frustrated at how difficult it is to get beyond the controversies that continue to waft within and around Wagner's works and their appreciation. Though we are in agreement against any kind of censorship in principle, Hilan wondered if he should expose his baby son to Wagner's music. 
Aesthetics discourse has a long history. Every orientation has been articulated and labored over. The one reflected by me in reaction to my sister's question is not widely endorsed: that initial impressions of art cannot be trusted. People do not want to be told that their spontaneous reactions to music or paintings need vetting. And in truth, I accept and respect their viewpoint as one I myself otherwise might endorse. Because of how much pain love-at-first-sight/hearing intoxication with art eventually caused me, however, I have been aversively conditioned to approach art with a lot more caution. Because of the fallout for me personally of my love of Wagner, all art has become suspect, guilty until proven innocent, and my reactions to it henceforth must be cleared through security and sobriety checkpoints, like screening passengers at airports and museums for weapons, or testing for blood alcohol levels. Like someone who slowly realizes they were raped, abused or otherwise exploited and will henceforth meet all romantic overtures with guardedness, or Holocaust survivors who reflexively distrust, I am now reprogrammed to never again allow myself the freedom to fall head over heals in love with art.

Richard Boch, a doorman at the Mudd Club, is completing a book about his experience there. He wanted to interview me about my brother, Steve Mass, who collaborated with several others in the creation of the club in 1977. With inchoate misgivings, I agreed to speak with Richard, with whom I was otherwise acquainted, but I withdrew when I sensed that this would not be the right venue for me to try to express myself about Steve and our estrangement. _____ 

I look at the two best-known photographs of Steve, of him in a plaid suit and another with him looking like the proverbial mad scientist, leering out with one eye, like a gecko, as he looks with the other through a microscope like the one or perhaps the very one my father the pathologist had at home when we were growing up. The plaid suit appears to be a costume or fashion statement of some kind, the mad scientist a fantasied ""Dr. Mudd."" These are fictional personae, I think to myself, and their creator is someone I never really knew.
The reasons for that are so various and elusive that I've decided to embark on these reflections to help me do what writing is best at--recouping people, places, things and times from memory and history, in hopes of giving them context and perspective. 
Plaids, in curtains, upholstery and clothes--like those of the Catholic school uniform skirts that became mandatory in America in the 1940's, and the madras plaid shirts favored by Steve's high school peers--were in style in the 1950's America where Steve came of age...
Steven Arnold Mass, nearly six years my senior, was born in Macon, Georgia, in 1940. Not an optimum time or place for Jews, to say nothing of gays. Steve wasn't gay but, unbeknownst to both of us during a time when even the word ""homosexuality"" was so taboo that it was virtually never uttered or even written, I was. 
A German American family down the road had a sign in their driveway that read ""No Dogs or Jews Allowed."" Later, I learned that ""No Dogs or [substitute any immigrant group] Allowed"" was a not uncommon posting in the history of so-called melting-pot America. Though I knew we were Jewish, such was my disconnection with our Jewishness that I'd no idea this had anything to do with me, and so I would play there with the other boys, searching the abandoned and overgrown pool for turtles and snakes. 
Likewise down the street was my best boyhood friend, Chester, whose American-Gothic lookalike mother ranted endlessly about ""niggers,"" and who later decided to forbid Chester to play with me because I was a Jew, which made me cry. Chester's dad worked at a gas station. I think they were Klan members. The Klan was very active in our area. Crosses were burned and when we were children, it was said that a black man had been hanged in front of one of the downtown's 2 movie theaters. 
This was the Southern heartland--with its pervasive mentality of bigotry and intolerance, of cruelty, meanness and hatred--that Tennessee Williams captured in his play Orpheus Descending. It's the South that never really surrendered to the North and that has been key to the rise of the present-day carpetbagger Donald Trump.
Such was the stigma we felt about being Jewish that we kids would walk on opposite sides of the streets of the town's two Jewish houses of worship, both of which our family belonged to--the orthodox synagogue (""Schul""), Temple Sherah Israel, where Steve was bar mitzvah'd, and the reformed temple, Beth Israel, where my sister was confirmed, and where we all got dressed up in costumes for the Jewish holiday Purim. 
Just as Verdi's Nabucco captures key aspects of our conflicts in Iraq with startling prescience, so Purim likewise fortells of those with Iran. Haman, the King's confidante who attempts to foment genocide against the Jews, has his precise counterparts today in former prime minister Ahmedinejad and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Meanwhile, Esther's ascendancy as Queen, and thus with the power to denounce Haman and influence the King favorably with regard to the Jews, has its admittedly troubled reincarnation in Ivanka Trump's marriage to an orthodox Jew. 
I remember choosing to dress as King Ahashueras after my initial taboo choice of Queen Vashti who, in contrast to natural-beauty, plainly-dressed Esther, got to wear a lot of jewelry. Early gay longings entangled with Jewish lore and festivity. 
Meanwhile, outside those confines of Temple and Schul, consciously or unconsciously, we kids would seize every opportunity to minimize our status as Jews. As mandated by our parents, we attended Friday Sabbath and holiday services, Sunday school and Hebrew school, but with the same enthusiasm we had for going to the dentist. I remember once seeing our rabbi crying, frustrated at the difficulty of successfully imparting what he felt we needed to know about being Jewish and Judaism. Sadness. Weakness. Not things we wanted to feel or be around.
 Temple Sherah Israel, Macon, Georgia
However thick the ambient anti-Semitism, I don't recall any major incidents of anti-Semitic violence during the years of our upbringing, like the notorious Leo Frank lynching in Atlanta in 1913, and the crimes of racism that remained commonplace. And as it turns out, the South has deep Jewish roots, communities that went way back, preceding the Civil War. This was true of Macon and elsewhere in Georgia, especially Atlanta and Savannah, and in neighboring states, and it included some who figured prominently in the history and heritage of the South, like Confederacy treasurer Judah Benjamin and David Emmanuel, the first Jewish U.S. governor. The University of Georgia Law School is named after Harold Hirsch, a prominent Atlanta attorney. As during the French Revolution, Jews found themselves on both sides of the American Civil War and a principal scapegoat of neither, a situation that seemed to lay the groundwork for a future of relative security. As for the episodic, disturbing, regrettable and mostly tragic history of Jewish collaborations, however circumstantial, with racists and fascists--e.g., Mussolini--it continues today with the rise of Donald Trump and Jewish extremists in Israel.

Growing up in Macon, Steve excelled at ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps, which still recruits students in high schools as well as at colleges) at Lanier High School, where he became adept at the operation of a rifle they gave him to keep and practice with at home, graduating from a bb gun he handed down to me, having taught me how to use it to shoot birds and squirrels. 
The school was named after the revered Macon poet, musician and educator Sidney Lanier, whose Wagnerism New Yorker music critic Alex Ross has commented on but whose military service in the Confederacy he has not. 
Ross keeps chalking up Wagnerites from a wide range of backgrounds in efforts to demonstrate that the composer's influence has been so great, so vast and varied as to subsume ongoing concerns about his legacy of anti-Semitism. Meanwhile, and notwithstanding Lanier's later distancing of himself from his Confederate service and support for slavery, efforts continue in Houston to change the name of its Lanier Middle School because of the name's association with the Confederacy. 
The move to rename Lanier Middle School is not the only such initiative. Also in Texas, this time in Austin, the school board voted to change the name of Robert E. Lee Elementary school. According to CNN, ""the decision came amid a larger trend of questioning Confederate memorials across the American South, given the Confederacy's legacy of violence, racism and white supremacy."" 
More recently, as reported in the New York Times, the Washington National Cathedral, one of the nation's most prominent houses of worship, said that it will remove two images of the Confederate battle flag that have been part of its stained-glass windows for more than 60 years. When I discussed this story with my closest friend, Joel Bradley, a liberal Southerner-New Yorker and distinguished addiction treatment specialist in employee assistance programs who hails from Elberton, Georgia and whose grandfather fought in the Confederacy, we both wondered if some efforts to eliminate emblems of historical events haven't gone too far.
Though the name of Richard Wagner is not the equivalent of the swastika or Confederate flag, and it's certain that Wagner will continue to be a leading presence in musical culture, it seems likely that in much the same vein that Southern institutions and landmarks are being scrutinized and cleansed of Confederate symbols and associations, future generations of Germans, Europeans and others will deprioritize Wagner from consideration for some name designations he might otherwise have claimed--for institutes, schools and landmarks.
At home and with straight faces, Steve, Ellen and I would march around the room singing the Christian hymnals we had to sing at school. (Our parents advised us to just mush-mouth any references to Jesus.) ""Onward Christian soldiers, marching off to war, with the cross of Jesus...Jesus loves me, yes I know, Father Bible tells me so."" And of course, ""Dixie"": ""Oh, I wish I were in the land of cotton..."" To say that old times there in Dixieland were not forgotten, specifically the glory days of the plantations and Confederate heroes like Robert E. Lee, whose birthday we still celebrated at school, would be as big an understatement as you could make about the post-Reconstructionist South we called home. 
We were too young to have a real awareness of our outsiderness, even as we could sense the distress it caused our parents. Though my father seemed welcome in all circles, following the period of his medical education when many institutions had quotas for Jews, my mother's encounters with the shut doors of the Junior League--remember Ms Hilly in The Help?--were hurtful. 
At home, meanwhile, our parents tried to acculturate us. Dutifully, I practiced piano, which I had no real penchant for. For my first and last recital, I played ""From the Halls of Montezuma To The Shores of Tripoli."" I guess our involvement in Libya goes way back. Who knew? I was never to become a musician, but my love for music did evolve from childhood crushes on Elvis Presley, the Everly Brothers, Jerry Lee Lewis, Theresa Brewer and Brenda Lee, whose hairdresser I was to meet and befriend years later at the baths in Fort Lauderdale. His clientele was mostly elderly women in senior residential facillities. At their first session, he would patiently explain: ""This is a comb, not a wand."" From my first vinyl 45 rpm (revolutions per minute) rock-and-roll records to Broadway show LP (long-playing) albums like My Fair Lady, I eventually moved on to what became the first great love of my life, opera, and its Grand Poobah, Richard Wagner. 
In those same childhood years I labored over one of my first books, James Michener's The Bridges at Toko Ri, which won a Pulitzer Prize and was made into a 1954 Hollywood film starring William Holden, Grace Kelly, Frederic March and Mickey Rooney. It's about the war with North Korea which, like the Civil War, and for that matter the Crusades, and for that matter again the American Civil War, we are still playing out. Though I never became a voracious reader, my interest in things literary developed in tandem with my love for music and opera. 
At school we read The Jungle Book and Lazy, Liza Lizard, and our teacher would model the costumes she acquired from her around-the-world tour, one of which, a kimono, set the stage for my first opera, Madama Butterfly. I can't remember at which of Macon's two historic universities it played--Mercer, named for Jesse Mercer, a prominent Baptist minister, or Weslyan College, one of America's first women's colleges and a birthplace of alumnae associations and sororities. More than a half century later, In ""Racism on Campus, Stories from New York Times readers,"" one Weslyan graduate recalled, ""The racial diversity at my college was basically all brochure pictures and no substance.""
Meanwhile, it was just this otherness that seemed the matrix of my brother's inimitable intelligence and wry, often twisted humor. Sensing our difference from the mainstream of Southern society, Steve, my sister and I were drawn to black singers of the times who appeared locally and later became legends, especially Little Richard, who in fact hailed from Macon. Just as these musicians were breaking through racial barriers by sheer talent, appeal and box office success, they gave inspiration to all outsiders, Jews prominent among them. But it wasn't until our move to Chicago that I attended my first concert with one of these legends--Ray Charles, whose ""Georgia on My Mind,"" written by Hoagy Carmichael in 1930, became the state's official song in 1979. 

Enter Jayne Mansfield and her 1956 film, The Girl Can't Help It. The title song by Little Richard, and two other of his biggest hits, ""Ready Teddy"" and ""She's Got It,"" helped make what was otherwise this B-est of B movies into one of the richest assemblages of period pop music on film, featuring such other leading artists of the day as Gene Vincent, Fats Domino, Eddie Cochran, Julie London, The Platters, Ray Anthony, Johnny Olenn, The Bell Boys, Abbey Lincoln, Eddie Fontaine, and Teddy Randazzo and the Three Chuckles. Outside the theater where the movie played, incidentally, was where the Klan was said to have carried out its lynching.
The year before, Mansfield's co-star Edmund O'brien was the villain in another film that offered rich hearings of pop era greats, Pete Kelly's Blues. Starring Jack Webb of early television cop drama Dragnet fame and the legendary Peggy Lee, it had cameos with the likes of Ella Fitzgerald, and, as a cigarette girl, Jayne Mansfield. Squeak!
It's hard to imagine more fertile soil for someone with a good ear for music and talent. Even in the heyday of the Mudd Club, however, I don't remember Steve ever singing a refrain or humming a tune in a way that reflected straightforward affection for it. Rather, in those 1950's years of our childhood and adolescence, he would exaggerate and parody singers and songs, the hits we all loved but especially the crooned renditions of standbys like ""Fascinating Rhythm"" by popular B-list singers like Julius LaRosa, Marguerite Piazza, Perry Como and Dinah Shore.
What Steve seemed to be trying to convey was his weisenheimer sense that the decorum we were seeing and hearing in mainstream entertainment and society was artificial, insipid, sentimental, ennervated, desexed, hypocritical, and funny as such. In Steve's sensibility, that artifice became the basis of what Susan Sontag would later become known for identifying as ""camp."" Steve was not gay, but he had what we gay people thought of as our special instinct for subverting social pretense with exaggeration, humor, affection and nostalgia. A droll and insightful if never exactly hilarious observer of people, and especially of 1950's culture, Steve was nonetheless an offshoot of the Jewish comedians we saw on our 12"" black-and-white Motorola TV who endeared themselves to mainstream America by using wit and facetiousness to upend provincialism and prejudice--Groucho Marx, Milton Berle, Sid Ceasar, Phil Silvers. Later, there was Lenny Bruce and eventually Woody Allen. At his most imaginative, Steve was the creator, operator-in-chief and behind-the-scenes (mostly) star of a Cabaret-style panoply of retro and cutting-edge fashions, design, theater, personalities, politics, happenings, musics and arts. At his more sardonic and reclusive, he was a shadowy figure from a performance artwork by Mudd Clubbers Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed.
How else to react to what was expected of Steve--daily ROTC exercises and daily application of the phylacteries my mother's Orthodox Jewish mother insisted on? Obediently but with that mix of pride and irony, arrogance and defiance that became hallmarks of his personality, Steve did both, meanwhile excelling among his genteel, gentile Southern peers in two key areas. Though he had to endure a lot of hazing, doubtless some or more than some it anti-Semitic, he became an Eagle Scout, a serious achievement for any young man at that time; and he was so good at golf, the ultimate entree into Southern male society, that his picture was featured with several other state champion team members in the Macon Telegraph. 
Steve was on his way, to be sure, but from Georgia to where? I don't think Steve ever thought of himself as belonging to the beats or any other movement, school, party, decade or even generational divide. Like people in recovery, and as stated in their preamble, Steve was not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution. But it was Jack Kerouac rather than recovery that could have been speaking for Steve when he wrote in 1957, ""Nothing behind me, everything ahead of me, as is ever so on the road.""

I had the privilege recently to attend a dance festival a bit different from the norm -- not one produced by an established organization, or part of a regional effort, or one of the well known dance festivals found in nearby New York City. This dance festival, billed as ""community-based,"" took place the first weekend of September in the New York City suburb of Montclair, New Jersey. This ""first annual Dance on the Lawn"" outdoor dance concert was held in a simple yet perfect setting, the front lawn of the local Episcopal Church. 
The key components of the performance space -- a festival banner, a marley covered platform stage and a great sound system - were complemented by a backdrop of trees, grass and the grand stone church to the rear. Add a warm, sunny day to the mix and the stage was set for a multi-faceted dance program for whomever dropped by to watch, lawn chairs and blankets in tow.

Teachers, students, artists and choreographers participating all generously donated their time, and the program was offered to its audience free of charge, something rare these days. Designed to help support dance and culture and ""celebrate the arts in our own communities,"" Dance on the Lawn hopes to become an annual event. 
A diverse group of artists from New York, statewide from New Jersey, and some of Montclair's own were among those who performed, including New York's Seán Curran Company & Brice Mousset's Oui Danse, and New Jersey's Maurice Chestnut, Donna Scro's Freespace Dance, Randy James' 10 Hairy Legs, Nancy Turano's New Jersey Dance Theater Ensemble, Sharron Miller's Academy for the Performing Arts' Performance Workshop Ensemble, and Kathy Costa's DanceWorks & Company. Contemporary dance, contemporary ballet, tap dance and modern dance were represented.

I was touched by the sight of a group of children, jumping and dancing, attempting to copy what they saw on stage. Job well done... isn't that what it's all about, inspiring and exposing the next generation to dance? 
Directed and curated by former Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater faculty member, dance performer and historian Charmaine Warren, and hosted by Nasha Thomas-Schmitt, former Ailey principal dancer and now head of national outreach for Ailey's Arts in Education & Community Programs, Dance on the Lawn has been a heartfelt project long in the making.

I sat down with Charmaine to better understand what it takes to produce a community-based dance festival, and how her model can inspire other towns to do the same. 
Here are some excerpts from that conversation:
What made you decide to produce Dance on the Lawn? 
For more than two years I've wanted to share my love of dance with fellow Montclair residents so I began planning this event. There are other arts festivals in Montclair, so it just made sense to bring dance home and offer a dance festival too!
What are some of the difficulties faced in curating this project? 
Because I've performed with some of the artists (I'm a curator and because no matter what, dance is part of my world), curating was not as difficult as it could have been. That said, I reached out some fabulous artists and asked them to perform without pay, and they said yes! The difficulty came when I, as an artist, knew how difficult it was for them to donate their time, so I set out to get financial assistance.
How did you find sponsors?
I am a Montclair resident, so I simply asked some wonderful people I know in the community for assistance. They signed on and donated their services (Toni's Kitchen, Studio042, Tony Turner Photography and IMANI, a community-based non-profit that offers educational support programs to promote high achievement for all students in the Montclair Public Schools). One company led me to another, and so on. For example, Donna Scro's Freespace Dance was an original company member of Seán Curran Company. 
How can Dance on the Lawn serve as a role model for dance festivals in other communities? 
I've been a curator for quite some time now - Harlem Stage's Dance Series, EMoves and The Wassaic Project Festival - so the curatorial part for me is not new. Being the producer/artistic director, though, is very new. The challenge was bringing all the pieces together and for the most part I was a one-woman-band. I don't recommend that route, but I will say that having good friends and supporters is a must. Stick with those in the community that know you and trust you. Talk to friends and supporters who you know will be there for you, no matter what!
 Brice Mousset's ""Oui Danse""
How can local dance festivals help inspire and mentor our young people? 
Exposure to dance has been shown to spur interest in the arts among young people. It's important to offer that exposure. I know that folks walked away feeling good about seeing dance; that's what counts.
Do you feel festivals such as yours help promote local dance companies? 
Absolutely. The hope that this festival will be just the beginning of celebrating dance in New Jersey! Other communities should do the same.
Do you have any recommendations for others seeking to produce local dance festivals? 
The best advice I can give is to follow your dream and don't be deterred by the many hills you have to climb; seriously, follow your dream -- the end result is so worth it!

Her joy in making and sharing art is evident in Collage -- the pieces in this book are playful, inventive, and utterly inspiring.",2014-10-30,ARTS & CULTURE,"In Part and Parcel, I talk with writers and artists about a fascinating facet of their work.

Recently, I watched a documentary about Steve Sabol, the irrepressibly creative president and co-founder of NFL films; I loved learning that he was also a mixed media artist. Speaking about his vision for film-making and storytelling, Sabol shared this quote from Cézanne: ""All art is selected detail."" I kept thinking of this phrase while enjoying the gorgeous, bizarre and intriguing pieces in Danielle Krysa's Collage: Contemporary Artists Hunt and Gather, Cut and Paste, Mash Up and Transform (published by Chronicle Books). In the book, Krysa showcases the work of thirty contemporary collage artists; additionally, she challenged each of them to create a new work starting with the same image. 
Krysa is an accomplished selector of detail, in both her own artwork and her efforts to champion other artists. She runs The Jealous Curator, an art site in which she highlights art that makes her feel envy and admiration. Krysa's joy in making and sharing art is evident in Collage -- the pieces in this book are playful, inventive, and utterly inspiring.
NOTE: My questions appear in bold. Scroll down to see images from the book, including the original image that artists were provided with. All images come from Collage by Danielle Krysa, published by Chronicle Books, 2014.
Q: In the introduction to Collage, you say that ""it's the treasure hunt -- the finding and sorting and selecting of images -- that is for many the most rewarding part of the process. Nothing makes a collagist happier than digging through a box of images or a stack of books until we uncover that perfect image -- the kind of image that stops the heart, just for a second, because of the amazing creative potential it holds."" What strikes me about these lines is how you expose not only the charge that the artist feels while creating, but also that flutter, that ache that we can feel in looking at someone else's art. Your work as The Jealous Curator seems similarly driven by the idea that viewing art feels like a treasure hunt.  What commonalities exist in the art that moves you? And as an artist, what aspects of your own work cause you to feel this charge? Creatively-speaking, what is it that you feel you are hunting?
A: Those are amazing questions! Yes, searching for work to feature on The Jealous Curator feels like an exciting treasure hunt, too. Sometimes I actually gasp out loud when I find pieces that I love! I suppose the art that moves me most is work that I wish I had made, i.e., work that uses similar images or techniques to my own. If I go back through the close to 2000 posts that I've written, the commonalities tend to involve portraits, muted palettes with pops of bright color, found images... oh, and I have a major soft spot for work that incorporates thread in some way. I also love work that has a wink to it... a bit of an edge, or a touch of humor that is just so clever you have no choice but to admire it.
 Original image that artists in Collage were given
When I'm creating my own art, I absolutely love feeling that heart-racing charge! It's a combination of things that can lead to a perfect day in the studio for me. It usually involves old books filled with pages and pages of slightly bizarre images (in those moments I literally cannot wait to get my hands on a pair of scissors), and I'm never happier when the embroidery that I'm totally winging actually works. On a day like that, everyone in my house should fully expect to order take-out for dinner because I'm not coming out of the studio until 3 a.m.!

What am I hunting creatively? Such an interesting question that is coming at a very interesting time for me. I think I've been searching for where I belong in the art world. As a curator? Yes, absolutely. As an art writer? Totally. As an artist? Hm, I don't know. I used to be a painter, but after a terrible critique in my last year of University (in which my painting prof said ""You should never paint again""), I quit painting altogether, and proceeded to completely second guess every piece of art that I've made over the last 19 years. As far as collage goes, I've always loved it so much, but because I enjoy it, I feel like maybe it doesn't count as ""real art""... isn't that the most ridiculous thing you've ever heard? Doing the book tour for Creative Block, and now Collage has been the most artistically healing thing I've ever done. I have finally realized that I am an artist. I am a collage artist. And it counts.

It's brought me and countless others a great deal of joy and helped form incredible friendships that mean the world to us.",2015-03-09,ARTS & CULTURE,"Today is an important day in the musical theater world -- the 67th birthday of Stephen Schwartz, the Tony-nominated composer and lyricist of shows such as Pippin, Godspell, Children of Eden, both the film and stage versions of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and of course, the smash hit Wicked. He has won three Oscars for his work in films such as Pocahontas and The Prince of Egypt and four Grammys for both the stage and film. He has also managed to win my admiration for his work.
My first interaction with Schwartz's work was long before I knew who he was. I watched The Hunchback of Notre Dame as a child and, while it wasn't at the forefront of my early elementary self's princess-obsessed mind, it still stuck around in the back of my mind. ""Hellfire"", Frollo's big solo number terrified me to no end. To this day, it still does.
Schwartz's music and I met again when I was nine and performing in the children's ensemble of my high school's production of Pippin. I was in complete awe of the entire cast and crew, and the music stayed in my head constantly throughout the rehearsal process and after the show's run. Later on, I became a fan of Wicked and realized the same man who wrote the music for the first musical I'd ever performed in wrote it. My mind was completely and utterly blown by that, along with finding out about his work in the creation of Godspell.
Last summer, I went with my grandmother and great-aunt to watch my county's summer stock production of the show Children of Eden. When I looked at the program and saw who its composer was, I knew I was in for a treat. The show opens with a large production number that tells the story of the first six days of God creating the Earth in order to ease the loneliness that he feels, ending at the point where Adam and Eve are created. 
The first act then goes on to tell their story, featuring gorgeous numbers such as ""The Spark of Creation"", ""The Naming"" and the eponymous song at the act's finale, I was in tears by intermission. 
The second act is the story of Noah and his family and is a bit happier. It calls back to the story of Adam and Eve through a subplot of Noah's son Japheth wishing to marry Yonah, a descendant of the race of Cain and a servant of Noah's family. Like the first act, it contains memorable songs such as ""Generations"", ""The Hardest Part of Love"", and Mama Noah's big song ""Ain't It Good?"" I left the show with a full heart and lifted spirits.
Mr. Schwartz, thank you so much for your incredible music. It's brought me and countless others a great deal of joy and helped form incredible friendships that mean the world to us. Your gift for storytelling is a blessing to the world of musical theatre. Thank you so much for reminding us all that there can be miracles when you believe.

I recently spoke to Mark Innerst to ask him a few choice questions about his work and his background. 
John Seed Interviews Mark Innerst

Mark Innerst
Tell me briefly about your background and education. I understand that as an undergraduate in Pennsylvania you were mainly interested in printmaking. 
Kutztown State College ( now a university) provided me with professors and courses of a great variety. From ""Old Master Drawing Materials"" to a visiting artist program including Vito Acconci, John Cage and many others. I did independent study in printmaking as well as life drawing. An internship program took me to NYC in my final semester and there I stayed.

Estuary, 2013 Oil on board in the artist's handmade frame  12 x 24 inches (board); 18 x 30 inches (frame)
For years you mainly worked in acrylic and have been transitioning to oil. How and why did that come about?   I worked in acrylic for many years. The introduction of fluid acrylics was what got me started. To be able indulge in rich transparent glazes, pure intense colors, that dried overnight was exciting. At some point I found I had the patience for the drying time of oils and that I didn't need to be so indulgent in that glazing and now find myself very comfortable with oils.

How did your ""Midtown"" series first develop?  The Midtown subject came to me as I was packing for our yearly rental in Florida. I wanted a compact focused project to take along. That view of those particular buildings was something I'd done once before but now seemed like something worth exploring further. I was in the mood to be neat and make nice straight edges that didn't have to be corrected. 
Usually I begin things in a much more gestural painterly way. I thought I'd come back from vacation with three finished paintings. Instead, they took much longer to complete and all those edges did have to be repainted any number of times. Once home making larger versions seemed natural and it did become a sort of series.

Industrial Landscape with Rain, 2014 Oil on panel in the artist's handmade frame 18 x 36 inches (panel); 25 1/4 x 43 inches (frame)
How do you keep your work so fresh?   When you ask how I keep things fresh I'm tempted to resist because it's such a compliment. It might be that I've moved around quite a bit and the world around me is new, and generally speaking the world around me is what I paint.

Market Street, 2014 Oil on canvas in the artist's handmade frame 30 x 30 inches (canvas); 38 1/2 x 38 1/2 inches (frame)
Have you always made your own frames? Tell me a bit about how they are made...  Frames. Well before NY I was infatuated with frames. Whether at a museum or a junk shop they would take my attention. I just like them and they do in fact protect the painting and allow one to handle it, which I think is appealing. I was an art handler myself early on, in a gallery setting, and I saw how easily damage can happen. I began making my own frames half out of necessity and half out of pleasure.

Midtown, 2013 Oil on board in the artist's handmade frame 36 x 14 inches (board); 42 x 19 1/2 inches (frame)
The buildings in the ""Midtown"" series move towards abstraction and linearity. Is that your way of idealizing the city, or it is simply an attractive direction to take with your work?   That particular row of buildings in midtown is simply that linear. They've stood out in my mind ever since my first trip to the city many years ago. At first they struck me as imposing and a little ominous, but now appear harmonious and graceful. Over the years I've seen a pattern where my subjects, through repetition, evolve and become simplified and more abstract. In this case it's a more faithful and straight forward portrayal. After some years of post modernist architecture, it was interesting to reflect on this landscape of modernist principled architecture.

Last year I had the pleasure and honor to become acquainted with Somi, an amazing jazz singer who was then about to release her album, The Lagos Music Salon. I found her to be thoughtful, sincere, and an awesome talent. I reviewed that album and a previous show on this page. Since then, I've watched her career continue to blossom, receiving accolades world wide, picking up many new fans and providing an example for empowerment and women's rights everywhere she goes. It has been a joy to behold. Last night she performed at The Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia -- my hometown. It was another stunning performance, this time with her excellent band using more spare arrangements, allowing her voice to soar with the most firm yet gentle support. I welcomed the chance to catch up with her and see where her career has gone since last we'd spoken, and she was again gracious with her time. The following responses have been edited for length and clarity.
When last we spoke, your album, The Lagos Music Salon, had just been released and you were in the crowd at another musician's performance. That was about 8 months ago. How has your life changed since then? With this being your second album, how has the experience been different? 
Ever since the album's release, I've been given so many wonderful opportunities to share my music with both new audiences and long-time supporters. I'm so very grateful for all of that, but not sure that I would say that my life has ""changed"" per se; only that I've been able to reach more and do more through my creative practice. I would like to believe every artist is interested in more expansive 'dreaming and doing' - it's a beautiful thing when there are clear markers of that along the journey. 
This is actually my fourth album, but my first on a major label. Obviously there is a certain type of social and cultural capital that accompanies that and which can open doors to even more visibility and career growth. More than anything, I feel fortunate to be counted among a long list of artists I respect deeply on the label's catalogue. 
As we'd discussed before, much of that album was inspired by the time that you'd spent in Nigeria, and you've also had travels in Africa recently. Can you explain your continuing connection with the continent, and how it affects your artistry? How were you received abroad this time?
The majority of my very large extended family live in East Africa, so my connection to the continent is deeply personal. Since I grew up mostly in Illinois, however, I became curious about my definition of ""home"" at a very young age. My work, therefore, seems to always be in pursuit of the cultural space between both here and there; as I really do feel equally African and American. I will say, though, that I feel more inspired on the African continent than anywhere else on this planet. I think that has something to do with the knowing that we have so many stories that have yet to be told - stories that give a more balanced and whole picture of who Africans are and can be in today's world. It's such an exciting time on the continent, no matter what industry you are in, and I love when I have the chance to plug into that energy and inspiration. Hopefully 'The Lagos Music Salon' album has helped audiences reimagine the humanity of Lagos or any other modern African city.
My recent trip was wonderful. I spent 6 weeks traveling through South Africa, Uganda and Rwanda. My time in East Africa was purely recreational and all about catching up with family. In Johannesburg and Cape Town, however, I was working: performing, doing lots of press, and shooting a new music video. South Africa has a deep musical history and love of jazz. I love how passionate and open-minded their audiences are. After performing there a few times, I've been able to connect with a really loving and growing fanbase there who really support what I'm trying to do. It's definitely a country where, as an artist, I feel most at home. I'll be heading back this spring and can't wait! 
One of the things that stands out in your music is the way that you weave topical messages in with, for lack of a better descriptor, adult contemporary sensibilities. To what degree is that a part of your process?
Ha! I can't help but laugh a bit at ""adult contemporary sensibilities."" Whatever the sensibilities or aesthetic one hears in my music, it's not something I necessarily set out to do. My music making is an organic process. No matter what the subject matter of the song, I try to honor all of my musical influences - whether they be jazz, hip-hop, afrobeat, soul, or (dare I say it to) something that sounds both adult and contemporary. At the end of the day, I'm really just trying to tell stories and frame them as best I can.

You're at a point in your career now where you are starting to repeat appearances in certain cities. How does it feel, for instance, returning to Philadelphia, albeit in a new venue?
It always feels great to come back to a city and have the chance to reconnect with and hopefully grow your audience in each place. As a New Yorker, Philly feels like the next door neighbor that I never get to spend much time with or get to know very well, so I am really excited to spend more time there and in other East Coast cities on this tour. 
Having witnessed your performances a few times now, I know how well you communicate specific and regional ideas into a common experience. The song, ""Ginger Me Slowly"" is one such example, which means to make one feel spicy and sweet. This is also your newest video release. Can you explain some of the ideas behind that production? How do you like making videos in comparison to making music?
Well, I haven't made a lot of music videos, but it's an entirely different process than making music. Mostly, I just love having the chance to think about and create a new performance of a song through a different medium and new creative dimension. I wanted the video for ""Ginger Me Slowly"" to have feel both intimate and artful. I also wanted to do it in a way that made one think about how nuance hides in minimalism. The song ""Ginger Me Slowly"" is about dreaming of a big and expressive kind of love, but it's also about learning to appreciate the simple yet meaningful declarations of that love. When choosing a treatment, I decided to go with South African director Kyle Lewis because it seemed to evoke all of those things. Hopefully audiences see that too!
What was most surprising about your tour thus far?
I love the surprises that sit inside of my band's improvisation every time we get on stage. Even though we've performed the music countless times, they continue to inspire and push me in ways that make the songs feel like a nightly chance to rediscover something new in my own voice and the very stories I'm trying to tell.
It's probably too early for fans to be expecting a new album, but have you made any plans yet for how you may approach your next project?
Well, I recently collaborated with Lebanese-French trumpeter Ibrahim Maalouf on a song cycle about the role of women during the Arab Spring Movement. We premiered the music at the Kennedy Center last May and really love the music so we're hoping to record it in the not-so-distant future. I've also just begun working on a jazz opera about the late South African singer and political activist Miriam Makeba. I'm not sure if and when that will become an album, but I'm looking forward to sharing more about that as it unfolds.
Somi continues to tour, with upcoming dates in New York, Boston, Vancouver and returning to the continent of Africa to perform at the Harare International Festival of the Arts. Her latest music video, ""Ginger Me Slowly"" makes it's debut here.

22,ARTS,11 Stunning (And Free) Fonts You Should Download Right Now,Mallika Rao,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-best-free-fonts_n_5235604.html,,2014-05-02,ARTS & CULTURE,"Used to be, every self-respecting design nerd paid for a font. Thankfully the time of terrible ""novelty fonts"" has given way to a new era, marked by clean and beautiful typefaces that are often more experimental than the kind you pay for. These days anyone from an art student to a moonlighting lawyer can hawk a free font to the masses via big platforms like Google Fonts or Facebook. And they are.
Why? Maybe to beta test a design before refining it for sale, or build credibility. ""Payment"" here is credit; often a designer will request a call-out tweet in return for a download, or ask that you link back when you use her work. 
In that open-source spirit, we've rounded up the freebies we love most, from a Dr. Seuss-inspired alphabet to a type based on erotic photography from the 1960s. Most include the full range of (English) letters, symbols and numbers. All deserve to be used and tweeted about, copiously. 
1. Construthinvism  Designer Pedro Fernandes was influenced by the hard lines of Cyrillic script in casting his hard-to-say font, as well as the Constructivist artists of revolutionary Russia -- in particular, Alexander Rodchenko. That's the artist, not the similarly named Star Trek character. (Though the font looks great in space.)

2. Typode

You are getting very sleepy. Unless you're a sucker for tech art, in which case this font may keep you awake tonight. Designed by typographer Santiago Ortiz, the characters in Typode are mapped to coordinates, so you can have some fun stretching and skewing them (there's more to do than the two manipulations we've shown). Head to Ortiz's site to download Typode, or just play around with it.

3. Brush Hand New
Some fonts have a canonical appeal. The original template for this one is Flash, a classic created by the typographer Edwin W. Shaar in 1939. In the 1990s, some kind soul anonymously redrew Flash into a ""simplified, slightly lightened, smoothed out"" version, according to a squib by the type company K-Type. The font below, Brush Hand New, is K-Type's update on the decades-old reboot, complete with ""European accented characters"" and an even smoother flow.

Download Brush Hand New here.  4. Mood
Designer Filiz Sahin tried to channel ""modern Swedish furniture,"" mechanical instruction manuals, and ""pop influenced '70s fonts"" for her font Mood. It's a motley trio of inspirations, but somehow we're seeing all of them in the just-abstract-enough shapes below.

Download Mood here.  5. Fabrica
Touted by its designers as ""the most legible typeface for mobile screen,"" Fabrica is a font for a not-so-distant future when we're doing everything on our phones. The ""deceptively simple sans serif typeface"" is intended to be neutral and functional, modeled off the ""systematic"" construction of the so-called Neo Grotesque fonts, a clean-lined group characterized by widely used fonts like Arial and Helvetica.

6. Nomed
This font is built from the simplest of structures: the triangle. As with Mood, what's incredible about the result is the balance between abstraction and legibility.

7. Tesla
Kansas-based designer Lexi Griffith found her inspiration in the ""circuitry of lightbulb filament and wiring intricately crossing paths."" It's the perfect font to channel on your six figure check to Tesla Motors.

8. Great in 88
Designer Dom Romero was born in 1988, as he explains on his Behance page, ""the year Michael Jordan, Transformers and professional wrestling ruled the planet."" Those phenomena guided his vision for the angular font below, a neon creation that slots right into the current type vibe (see: Drive).

8. Amsterdam Superstar
Inspired by the erotic photography of the 1960s and '70s, the aptly-named, geometric font below is Boogie Nights meets Bauhaus. Fonts of Chaos, the outré collective that offers it (a past font from the same designer was called PornoJunky), bills Amsterdam Superstar as ""sweet and simple,"" like naughty pics of yesteryear.

10. The Cat Has A Hat
Meant to be ""playful but not childish,"" the Dr. Seuss-based font below is by Lukee Thornhill, an amateur designer out of England. On his Behance page, Thornhill describes a weekend spent painting more than ""1,500 letters, numbers and symbols over and over again in hopes that...I would be able to piece together a brush font I was happy with."" Boy deserves some green eggs and ham stat.

11. Barnstormer
Because some portion of all days should be spent contemplating the Wright Brothers, Amelia Earhart, and anyone else who wore aviator goggles for real. This all-caps typeface is influenced by stunt pilots of the early 20th century, according to creator Jonathan Heter, another Kansas-based designer. The baby Carl in all of us approves.

23,ARTS,7 Classic Feminist YA Books Everyone Should Read,"Margo Rabb, ContributorAuthor, 'Kissing in America'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/classic-feminist-ya_b_7504674.html,,2015-06-15,ARTS & CULTURE,"My new novel, Kissing in America, is a feminist story about a young girl coming into her own as she gradually understands the complexities of grief and loss and love. As I wrote the book over the course of seven years, I kept thinking back to seven books I read when I was a teen, narratives that seeped under my skin and shaped who I am. Although they're not all traditional YA titles, they have great appeal to young adults, regardless of whether or not the books were published or marketed as YA. (In the words of Patrick Ness: ""YA is not a genre. It contains all genres."") I can't imagine how I would have survived adolescence--or adulthood--without them. 
 Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, 1847 I first read Jane Eyre when I was 16, huddled under the covers, and I fell in love with Jane's indomitable will and her ability to survive the cruelty of Lowood, and any hardship (or madwoman in the attic) that came her way. When Jane tells Rochester, ""I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh: it is my spirit that addresses your spirit...equal--as we are!"", I decided, then and there, to be like Jane and to defy ever being classified as ""poor, obscure, plain, and little,"" and to throw out all inequalities, whether of class, gender, age, or experience. Reader, we all need Jane in our lives. 
 Anne of the Island by L. M. Montgomery, 1908 Though the first volume of Anne of Green Gables is Montgomery's best-known book, Anne of the Islandwill always be my most beloved of the series. In this book, Gilbert tells 19-year-old Anne, ""You are the first Avonlea girl who has ever gone to college; and you know that all pioneers are considered to be afflicted with moonstruck madness."" Montgomery herself had a difficult life filled with much to overcome--depression, a challenging marriage, the societal constrictions for a woman at the turn of the century--and reading Montgomery's journals as a companion to the Anne books adds complexity and nuance to her heroine. At the end of Anne of the Island, Anne becomes a writer, and ""literary ambitions sprouted and budded in her brain."" She falls in love with Gilbert on her own terms, choosing not only him--a man who values her intelligence and desire for freedom--but her biggest passion: Prince Edward Island itself, her true home. 
 I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith, 1948 How can you not fall in love with a book whose first line is, ""I write this sitting in the kitchen sink""? I Capture the Castle is Cassandra Mortmain's diary written in various notebooks--the Sixpenny Book, the Shilling Book--and in these pages, she struggles with poverty, loneliness, and her dreams of love. It's also a novel about writing and failure: Her father, who published a novel that was an enormous critical and commercial success, has now become a reclusive, penniless man who never completed another book. Cassandra's sister, Rose, chooses to marry a rich man to bring money to her family, and tells her sister, ""I promise you will never make any more longing cat noises when I am a married woman...when I feel lonely, I sit and look at the towels till I cheer up."" I Capture the Castle also has one of my favorite last lines of all of literature: ""I love you, I love you, I love you."" 
 Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank, 1952 Alice Munro has said, ""The complexity of things--the things within things--just seems to be endless. I mean nothing is easy, nothing is simple."" In the pages of her diary, Anne Frank makes sense of not only her own life, but of all the sorrows and complexities of the world. ""The brightest spot of all is that at least I can write down my thoughts and feelings,"" Anne wrote, and her life on the page deeply changed my own: Inspired by her, I started keeping a diary, writing in it almost every day since I was 15. Anne showed the world the complex truth about teenagers: how we were not the shallow beings society seemed to assume we were, but wise and philosophical and capable of articulating even the most elusive and complicated truths. Her diary made me realize how writing can be a way to make sense of one's thoughts and one's life the way nothing else can. 
 The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, 1970 This was the first book I ever read by Toni Morrison, and it blew the lid off what I knew of literature--it showed me the power fiction has to convey tragedy and life and loss with so much sadness and terrible beauty. Eleven-year-old Pecola Breedlove believes that if only she had blue eyes, everything would change: ""If those eyes of hers were different, that is to say, beautiful, she herself would be different."" The novel made me think about what society expects of girls, and how the constructions of race and class and gender affect us and torture us. The Bluest Eye changed me as a reader, and made me hungry for novels that took risks and told their stories in the most poetic way. ""Had any adult with the power to fulfill my desires taken me seriously and asked me what I wanted, they would have known that I did not want to have anything to own, or to possess any object. I wanted rather to feel something..."" says narrator Claudia MacTeer. Reading The Bluest Eye as a teenager changed the way I thought of myself and the way I looked and fit into the world. 
 Tiger Eyes by Judy Blume, 1981 I first read Tiger Eyes years before I'd lost a parent myself, and it's become a novel that I reread regularly because of its pitch-perfect portrait of grief. Davey copes with the death of her father with more capability and strength than her own mother does, and her maturity and independence inspired and comforted me when I lost both my own parents years later. ""We are getting to be experts at sleeping during the day,"" Davey says, narrating her family's experience matter-of-factly and without sentimentality. Blume packs more honesty and emotional truth into this tiny novel than scores of other books ever achieve. ""Some changes happen deep down inside of you,"" Davey realizes. ""And the truth is, only you know about them."" 
 In Summer Light by Zibby Oneal 1985 In Summer Light is the perfect summer novel. It's a quiet portrait of a young artist, Kate Brewer, who's growing up in the shadow of her famous artist father, and the summer she spends at home on their family's island--a fictionalized Martha's Vineyard--while a relationship develops with Ian, a graduate student who's cataloguing her father's work. Ian is 25 and he and Kate forge a relationship that's never quite a romance, but not solely a friendship either; it's the tale of a deep bond told with a quiet maturity. ""Painting has to do with knocking yourself out day after day trying to get what you want to down on the canvas. Maybe it works and maybe it doesn't, but every day you try,"" Kate learns over the course of the summer. I was 17 when I first read In Summer Light, and I was learning then that fiction was not only a place for me to escape and to dream, but it was where I could try on different personalities--I could be Kate and Jane, Anne and Claudia, Davey and Cassandra--and I could fall in love and lose love and become an artist, and be strong and on my own. These novels helped clear the confusion of my life, and when I reread them now, they continue to clear that confusion, because even adults never stop needing heroines, and never stop coming of age.

24,ARTS,Art as Investment,"Maguire Mealy, ContributorGraduate, McGill University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/art-as-investment_b_7050220.html,"In February, the art market was shocked by the news that Marina Picasso, granddaughter of Pablo Picasso and heiress to about 10,000 works by the artist, plans to sell an indefinite number of works to finance and broaden her philanthropy.",2015-04-13,ARTS & CULTURE,"In February, the art market was shocked by the news that Marina Picasso, granddaughter of Pablo Picasso and heiress to about 10,000 works by the artist, plans to sell an indefinite number of works to finance and broaden her philanthropy. Ms. Picasso had been regularly selling works by her grandfather for years to support herself and the charities she has founded -- yet, what shocked market speculators was that she planned to speed up this flow, and sell a lot at once. Instead of selling the works through an auction house or art dealer, Ms. Picasso plans to sell each of these works in private sales. Her unconventional approach has art dealers and auctioneers, who are traditionally used to controlling the sales of rare and expensive art, worrying over the potential repercussions. At $449 million sold, Picasso was the world's second highest selling artist at auction in 2014, just behind Andy Warhol. Picasso's famous Femmes d'Alger (1955) will be offered at Christie's auction house in May 2015 with an estimate of $140 million, and will likely be auctioned for more than Francis Bacon's record-setting Three Studies of Lucian Freud (1969) sold at $142.2 million in 2013, potentially making it the most expensive painting sold at auction, ever. Dealers, auctioneers, and private owners of Picassos have a lot to lose if Marina Picasso floods the market with her grandfather's work, as auction sales and private baluations of Picasso's works will undoubtedly plummet.
The story of Marina and the Market offers an interesting case study of the art market, and the role of artworks as investments. The works of name-brand artists such as Picasso, Warhol and Bacon have become very much akin to stocks in name-brand companies such as Apple, Google or Amazon. The sale of Picasso's Femmes d'Alger this year, expected to break the record for the most expensive painting ever auctioned, is akin to Facebook's 2013 IPO, the world's third largest at $104 billion. In an article on the future sale of Picasso's work, Artnet, a prominent online art market watchdog, described the auction house Christie's effort to ""mitigate risk"" by offering a guarantee on the sale. This language is reminiscent of the rhetoric surrounding hedge funds, mutual funds, and the multitude of instruments that our global financial system deals in. Risk is a key factor in this system -- at its most basic level, riskier investments can lead to both higher rewards, and greater losses. The global financial crisis of 2008 is brought to mind, which began because of risky mortgage investments by large banks such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup. This comparison begs the question; will the art market meet a similar fate?
People often buy art in the multi-million dollar range not just because they like it (although that may be a factor), but because they think that the work of art will appreciate in value. You buy a stock expecting to be able to sell it for a higher value later -- however, whether or not the value of stock will go up or down from here on out is unclear. Uncertainty is one of the most potent forces in the stock market; as Matthew McConaughey's character said in The Wolf of Wall Street, ""Nobody knows if the stock is going up, down, or in circles."" In many ways, there is much less risk involved with buying a Picasso than buying stock in a Fortune 500 company. Picasso is one of the world's most sought-after painters, and his place has been firmly established in the art historical canon as one of the world's best modern painters, if not the best. Picasso will never go out of fashion, and his works will always be sought after. Picasso was remarkably prolific during his career; the Picasso Project has catalogued upwards of 25,000 works by the artist, and there are doubtless many more. There will always be Picassos to sell, and there will always be someone to buy them. 
Yet beyond the Picassos, the Warhols, and works by a handful of modern and historic masters, much of the art that is bought at the big fairs and auctions, which constitutes a large part of total art sales, is from contemporary artists. Preeminent among these is Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons. Hirst is famous for his record-breaking diamond skulls and embalmed sharks, while Koons is best known for his metallic balloon animals, including a red balloon dog that sold for $58.4 million. However, whether or not future investor-collectors will value works by Hirst or Koons for more than they are valued at now remains to be seen. The global financial crisis of 2008-09 was brought on by the collapse of banks that were heavily invested in subprime mortgage-backed securities, which were based on mortgages extended to people that were unable and increasingly unlikely to repay. Those securities were failed investments -- because so many people defaulted on their mortgage payments, they were bought for more than they would be worth in the future. While it is somewhat of a stretch, the multi-million dollar sales of works by contemporary artists such as Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons are similar to those securities in that there is no guarantee the works will increase in value. The bullish trend in the contemporary art market has built up excitement around particular contemporary artists just as the global financial market had built up excitement around presumably low-risk mortgage-backed securities and other ""new"" financial instruments. Hirst and Koons do not have the same critical validation that Picasso had, and occupy a much less secure place in the art historical canon. Future investor-collectors will undoubtedly be caught up with some other ""hot"" artists, and those that have bought multi-million dollar works by Koons and Hirst will lose out big time. Because, let's face it, there is absolutely no way that someone would spend $58.4 million on a balloon animal for aesthetic or sentimental reasons. 
The investment mindset of collectors and the bullish trend in the contemporary art market has undoubtedly changed the entire art world for the worse. Collectors that buy art because they like it are being crowded out by oil-barons from the mid-east and wealthy investment bankers that instead buy art to invest. Contemporary artists feel increasing pressure to play into the market in order to succeed. It will take a crash-like the global financial crisis to change this speculative attitude towards collecting art, and it is no longer a question if this crash will come, but when.

25,ARTS,How The Rise Of The Middle Class Shaped American Folk Art,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/american-folk-art_n_6956304.html,,2015-03-28,ARTS & CULTURE,"
The dictionary defines folk art as work ""produced typically in cultural isolation by untrained often anonymous artists or by artisans of varying degrees of skill and marked by such attributes as highly decorative design, bright bold colors, flattened perspective, strong forms in simple arrangements, and immediacy of meaning.""
While this definition conjures exoticized images of far off lands and age-old traditions, it fails to encompass the entire scope of global folk art -- for example, the crop born and bred in the United States. An exhibition at the Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts entitled ""American Folk Art, Lovingly Collected"" will explore the branch of folk art shaped not by cultural isolation, but by the quickly changing cultural landscape engulfing it. 

Two Children in Blue, about 1840 attributed to Mary B. Tucker Image: Courtesy of the Worcester Art Museum
""Over the years there has been much debate of what folk art is,"" Paul D’Ambrosio, curator of the exhibition, explained in an interview with The Huffington Post. ""But I see it as broad category of Americana done by artists with little or no formal training in the fine arts. It's a body of work that was brought together in the early 20th century by a diverse group of people.""
""This includes portraits, landscapes, needlework pictures, quilts, painted furniture, all kinds of decorative arts. Sculptures, carvings, shop signs, cigar store figures. It's a very broad category, but it speaks to the centrality, the absolute integration, of handmade goods in American society, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries."" 

Child in a blue dress; Courtesy of the Worcester Art Museum
The exhibit provides a rare glimpse into the 19th century transformation of a New England town, and in turn, the town's unexpected effect on a burgeoning art movement -- one that arguably has more in common with a remote civilization than Western tradition. In 1800, Worcester County had about 60,000 residents. By 1840 it had grown to 95,000. In the decade that followed, between 1840 and 1850, the population grew by another 35,000 people to 130,000. ""So you're talking about exponential growth,"" D’Ambrosio explained. ""Along with this there are advancements in industrial technology, improvements in transportation, and the artists that created these works. They didn't have an industrial technique but they had an understanding of mass production and that's an idea that came along with the industrial revolution.""
The art of this period is characterized by flattened portraits against a neutral, monotone backdrop, the subject either in full profile or looking straight at the viewer. Their straightforwardness is almost awkward, recalling the naivety of artists like Henri Rousseau or Morris Hirshfield. Yet the inspiration for said artworks wasn't the ""primitive"" artists of Europe, but rather the mechanization of the U.S. 
""In 1800, artists imitated the mechanical means with their hands' work. A portrait painter would paint a similar composition over and over again, it would be called a formula or a stock pose. They would take elements and repeat them in order to speed up the production of the works. They were not judged as art, they were furnishings at the time. Artists would emphasize whatever they were best at, and their pictures would conform to their best talents to create the best possible products."" 

Mrs. Kendall, about 1831 attributed to Ruth Henshaw Bascom Image: Courtesy of the Worcester Art Museum
A thriving middle class bolstered an engorged supply of commercial goods, many of which were made by hand. This newly skewed supply and demand opened up space for a healthy art market, able to make a living through their production of bright and bold handmade goods. However, despite their economic success, such folk artists were never considered on par with formally trained fine artists, until, perhaps, now. 
Although it sounds almost counter-intuitive, the industrial revolution molded the 19th century culture of folk art, imbuing it with handmade alternatives to booming mechanical trends. ""Some went as far as William Matthew Prior  who developed a price scale where he charged less for simpler pictures and charged more for more elaborate ones. Basically, time is money. They're in this transitional period toward mass production, where soon they will be replaced by mechanical processes such as photography and lithography.""

Boy in Blue with Recorder, 19th century attributed to George G. Hartwell Image: Courtesy of the Worcester Art Museum
In this final moment before the eventual mechanical takeover, we see images oddly teetering between the handmade and the automatic, like stunted hybrids on the verge of a breakthrough. It's an interesting juxtaposition to the contemporary relationship between art making and the internet -- an artistic moment explored in MoMA's current contentious exhibition ""The Forever Now: Contemporary Painting in an Atemporal World,"" which posits that ""courtesy of the internet, all eras seem to exist at once.""
""American Folk Art, Lovingly Collected"" will run from July 15 until November 29, 2015 at the Worcester Art Museum. Until then, enjoy the preview below.

""Architect James Chuda's Green Home has been called the ""Fabergé egg"" of the green design world."" Barbara Lockhart International Designer of the Year 2006
The Los Angeles Magazine's Design Green Home of the Year
When international interior designer Barbara Lockhart came on board she convinced publisher Alan Klein (Los Angeles Magazine) to motivate other designers to tap into what would soon become a burgeoning green marketplace.
Klein gave a green light to the project.
""We launched DesignHouse 2005: The Green Home to help the Chudas educate people how to fuse a healthy home lifestyle with a finely honed design aesthetic.""

Lockhart became Honorary Chair of the Design Committee and summoned Suzanne Furst then president of ASID to assist with the translation of impeccable interiors utilizing green materials. Others followed suit. Troy Adams, Leslie Harris, Sari Ehrenreich, Greg Grande, Kristine Kamenstein, Meg Kalhammer, Carla Sofia, Paula Lechman-Testa and master wood craftsman, Cliff Spencer. Jim Hellinger, landscape architect created an organic vegetable garden with sustainable water conservation landscape features. Pond specialist Peter Logan bridges the connection to nature with a beautiful water garden entry.

 Everyone in American got to see The Chuda's Green Home on Oprah and there are over 32,000 views of the Muse Elementary School visit on YouTube.
Chuda wanted the public to experience a home that truly connects with nature and nurtures a healthy creative lifestyle.

 A virtual Healthe Home was created to educate parents about safer alternatives in their home environment
As co-founder of Healthy Child Healthy World he wanted to show why we should eliminate toxic off-gasing materials from or home interiors. Indoor air pollution is the biggest cause of childhood illness such as asthma.
""We seal up our homes, which are filled with toxic materials that off-gas residues, many of which are hazardous to our health. Especially children who are more vulnerable""
Having lost a child to cancer at age 5, Chuda's inspiration was to build a research laboratory to educate future home owners. ""We need to limit the use of toxic materials and provide healthier home environments.""
""American children and adults spend 90% of their time indoors."" The Environmental Protection Agency ranks poor indoor air quality among the top five environmental risks to public health.
Asthma rates have doubled over the last 20 years, according to the U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Asthma attacks are triggered by indoor air pollutants.
Education is the key. Not only to potential new home buyers but to people like brokers and appraisers who set the bar for real estate.
Jay Tucker Elm from Sotheby's International calls The Chuda's Green Home, ""glamorous and earthy.""
 ""This is something everyone in America has to see, the Chuda's Green Home."" Oprah Winfrey
Buyers need to make appropriate decisions not just based on economics but the real value should be health.
In today's competitive marketplace the MLS systems lack sufficient means of measuring benefits of environmentally friendly properties.
When it comes to energy efficiency and ""green"" features in homes, there's a chasm-sized disconnect in the marketplace among consumers, real estate appraisers and the nation's realty sales system. On the one hand, prospective buyers routinely tell researchers that they place a high priority on energy-saving and environmentally friendly components in houses. The presence of high-efficiency systems in a home makes shoppers more interested in buying because they'll save money in the long run. 
But the real value is not about saving money. Money can't buy health.
Editor's Notes:
A very special thanks to Barbara Lockhart whose lifetime achievements include; recipient of the S.M. Hexter Award for the Most Outstanding Interior Designer in America; the ASID Lifetime Achievement Award; the Beverly Hills Architectural Achievement Award.

The show brings together about fifty masterpieces by Paul Gauguin from leading international museums and private collections such as the Musée d'Orsay, Paris; the Museum Folkwang, Essen; the Tate in London; the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the National Gallery in Prague; and the Hermitage in Saint Petersburg. The exhibition focuses on Gauguin's world-famous paintings he created in Tahiti, complemented by diverse self-portraits and paintings from the time he spent in Brittany. In his Tahiti paintings, Paul Gauguin celebrates his ideal of an unspoilt exotic world, harmoniously combining nature and culture, mysticism and eroticism, dream and reality.
In addition to paintings, the exhibition includes a selection of Gauguin's enigmatic sculptures that evoke the art of the South Seas that had by then already largely vanished. One of the works on show, the 1892 oil painting, Nafea Faa Ipoipo (When Will You Marry?), was recently sold for a new record price for an artwork. Rumor has it it was sold for nearly $300 million to Qatar Museums. Prior to the sale, the Gauguin painting had been on loan to the Kunstmuseum in Basel. The exhibition at Fondation Beyeler runs until June 28, 2015.

28,ARTS,"A Brief Rant on the Exhaustion of the Avant-Garde, Zombie Formalism and What Contemporary Painting Needs to Move Forward","John Seed, ContributorProfessor of Art and Art History, Mt. San Jacinto College",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-brief-rant-the-exhausti_b_6557184.html,"There is a deep need for art that is authentic, engaged with the world and more about skill and knowledge than ego. Representation, which has been so restricted for the past decade, has vast untapped potential, and can be ""progressive"" in countless unexpected ways.",2015-01-27,ARTS & CULTURE,"
Pierre Auguste Renoir, Nude in the Sun, circa 1875-6, oil on canvas, 32"" × 25.6"" 
""...Try to explain to Monsieur Renoir that a woman's torso is not a mass of decomposing flesh with those purplish-green stains.""- Critic Albert Wolff, writing about Renoir's Nude in the Sun
Hard to believe, isn't it, but Renoir's Nude in the Sun was once considered threatening: when first exhibited it's Impressionist palette violated long-standing academic rules about the use of color in shadows. These days you won't find a museum director anywhere in the world who wouldn't covet the tiny, sun-dappled nude, and the once offensive image is emblazoned on a coffee mug that can be purchased on eBay for $13.99 with free shipping. Now that its original aura of challenge and disruption has dissipated, a work of art that was once cutting-edge has now entered another category: it is a certified and fully commoditized masterpiece. Nude in the Sun should be considered ""formerly avant-garde"" as the cultural shock that it once evoked was exhausted years, even generations, ago. 

To fully understand the original antipathy critics felt towards Renoir and other French modernists -- Wolff, for example, felt that Manet was an improviser whose work was marred by searching, hesitation and pain -- it is important to recall that the sclerotic critic was defending the aesthetic ideals and traditions of the French Academy, an entrenched and formidable cultural institution. 
Now, 140 years after Wolff derided it, Nude in the Sun resides in another kind of cultural institution, the Musée d'Orsay, and the tables are turned. Modern art and its children -- Postmodern and Contemporary Art -- are the ""Academy"" of our time, and the tradition of the avant-garde has been elevated and enshrined to the point that you might even say that it has been embalmed. The values of the avant-garde, including individualism, experimentation and progress, are now sacrosanct, and the boards of Modern and Contemporary art museums in the United States are populated by the nation's wealthiest, most culturally elite citizens. They serve the same conservative role that titled aristocrats played in the European academies of the past: they are guardians of the dominant culture. 
This creates real problems, as truly avant-garde works of art need the tension created by opposing cultural values and institutions to sustain their meanings and put them in relief. When too many people come to embrace avant-garde works and styles, their intended purposes and meanings wilt and die quickly. As a biologist will tell you, things grow best when subjected to the right stresses, and culture is the same way. Healthy values -- including social, political and cultural values -- need constant challenge and revision to remain fresh, and it strikes me that the spirit of the avant-garde in art is exhausted and complacent: Its ""progressive"" values have become de rigueur. If you see the words ""pushes the boundaries of..."" in an art review, you have encountered a critical blandishment that has become a cliché, ready to be retired.

Modernism's ennoblement of progress -- a value it absorbed from the Industrial Revolution -- made new types of painting possible while demoting others. In the United States modernism's determined march forwards opened the door for Abstract Expressionism, America's most significant and genuinely avant-garde form of visual art. On the other hand, a continuing over-emphasis on the value of the ""new"" has strained and distorted many of painting's historical purposes and intentions. In too many instances the notion of ""progress"" has stripped meaningful content from painting only to replace it with novelty and gimmickry that poses as ""new.""
Realism, one of the related forms of painting that would have been acceptable to the members of European Academies, has been consistently relegated to the sidelines. As artist Eric Fischl noted in a 2009 interview, ""There's always been realist painting. The avant-garde ignores 99 per cent of it.""
Compared with realism, the broader field of representational painting has done a bit better in finding its place in the avant-garde: I'll be bold and say that only 98 percent of it gets ignored. Generally speaking, the representational art that makes its way into the mid and upper ranks of the contemporary art field has to be credentialed as avant-garde in some fashion. ""Outsider"" status can work, as can a reliance on subject matter that is ""deconstructed"" in relation to social, sexual and political issues. Self-conscious strangeness, obsessiveness, and irony can ""credential"" representation, and so can Warholian strategies involving mechanical and technological methods of image making. Conceptualism, which I think tends mixes with representation very lamely, can also get you in the front door of the avant-garde academy. Sadly, a connection to wealth and/or celebrity can work too. 
For representational painters whose work does fall into one of the categories above there are pitfalls to be avoided. For example, painter Bo Bartlett believes that ""To be earnest is the greatest taboo in contemporary art."" Any representations of conventional beauty that don't have a dose of nihilism mixed in are excluded from the avant-garde as ""kitsch,"" but self-conscious super-kitsch is a hot ticket. 
If I haven't transcribed the current rules and perimeters of acceptable avant-garde representation perfectly, I apologize: they aren't written down in a handbook anywhere, but they definitely exist. I also doubt that the French Academy had a manual forbidding purplish-green shadows on human skin, but Albert Wolff knew the rules and limits of his era's academy regardless. When a cultural system has ossified and become fragile, knowing the rules is especially important, and both artists and critics need to pay close attention. In New York right now, the matrix of unspoken rules has resulted in a vogue of abstract and semi-abstract paintings by young artists that play it safe by saying very little, but sell well. Critic Walter Robinson, who first noted the ""reductive, straightforward, essentialist..."" urges present in this new school of painting, gave it a grim, clever name that has stuck: Zombie Formalism. 
Peter Schjeldahl, the art critic for the New Yorker, has been looking over this new genre of offhandedly abstract painting, and in his recent review of The Forever Now: Contemporary Painting in an Atemporal World, he observes that the young painters represented use ""tactics"" which ""include emphases on gritty materiality and refusals of comforting representation."" He also notes that the ""joys"" of the works on view come ""freighted with rankling self-consciousness or, here and there, a nonchalance that verges on contempt."" The ""joy"" he describes sounds very circumscribed indeed, especially for a show presented at MOMA, the original temple of America's avant-garde. 
The ""nonchalance"" that Schjeldahl notes apparently exists in a void that critic Andrew Sullivan believes has been created in an art world ""bubble"" inflated by ""flipping"" and the transformation of avant-garde works of art into bankable financial instruments. In a year-end commentary titled Where Does 2014 Leave the Art World, critic Goldstein derides Zombie Formalism complaining that: ""The intellectual content that allowed previous developments in painting--gestural abstraction, process-driven minimalism, et cetera--to break new artistic ground is voided, leaving a colorful corpse so devoid of ideas one could imagine it craving human brains."" Is it just me, or does Sullivan's use of the phrase ""colorful corpse"" sound a bit like Wolff's complaints over Renoir's ""mass of decomposing flesh with those purplish-green stains""? 
The situations that both critics describe -- even though their tone differs somewhat -- strike me as symptomatic of avant-garde exhaustion: Zombie Formalism is an ironic, self-conscious artistic response to a situation in which academic rules have choked off the oxygen painting needs to breathe. And yes, it is also a tiny over-commoditized avant-garde zone supported by speculators. Andrew Goldstein thinks the movement is short of ""intellectual content"" and ""ideas,"" but I see it a bit differently. 
If the situation I have outlined sounds distressing -- and in many ways it is -- it is also a moment when change seems imminent. There are many fantastic artists out there making significant work, ready to burst onto the scene when change blossoms. There have never been more institutions dedicated to contemporary art or more money available to be spent on it, and that is a good thing. The problem is that the definition of avant-garde needs to be revised to encompass and include art and artists that are brave enough the reach backwards and forwards at the same time. The avant-garde of the future needs to feed itself with hybridization, consolidation and assimilation. 
I think that painting has to look back over its shoulder to realist and academic painting before the Salon des Refusés; in fact, it can and should go all the way back to Lascaux if it needs to. I see the history of painting as a very long line with no beginning and no end. Culture has certainly created moments and movements in painting -- most recently we have called them ""isms"" -- and living in a media age artists can have access to all of them, although not always on a first-hand basis. I like what the painter Jean Hélion said: ""All the 'Isms' seem to me to be facets of a whole that should be painting."" 
There is a deep need for art that is authentic, engaged with the world and more about skill and knowledge than ego. Representation, which has been so restricted for the past decade, has vast untapped potential, and can be ""progressive"" in countless unexpected ways. As I commented in my review of The Figure: Painting Drawing and Sculpture, Contemporary Perspective, ""contemporary representation is coming on strong,"" and I think that schools like the New York Academy, which equip students with a strong base of traditional skills, are equipping a generation of artists who will re-invigorate and re-define the avant-garde. 
I would like to think that zombie formalism is the end-point of one kind of thinking about painting; as ""isms"" go, I predict it will be a blip. Peter Schjeldahl believes that ""painting has lost symbolic force and function in a culture of promiscuous knowledge and glutting information,"" but I think he is wrong. As Renoir knew, when painting finds a way to resist rigid culturally imposed rules, it can persist, become relevant again and thrive.

Sederer, MD, ContributorChief Medical Officer, New York State Office of Mental Health",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-innocents-a-film-review_us_57ba0fdfe4b07d22cc38a434,"It is December of 1945 and the fields are draped white with snow, the roads mushy and the air a damp cold. We are in Poland",2016-08-21,ARTS & CULTURE,"It is December of 1945 and the fields are draped white with snow, the roads mushy and the air a damp cold. We are in Poland after The War. The Russians have seized their plunder, namely this Eastern Bloc country that wanted no part of Nazi Germany, but was invaded and then what choice did they have?
The story, recreated from actual events, takes place principally in two settings: a cloistered convent for nuns (Sisters or Soeurs since the film is largely in French, with English subtitles) and in the French Red Cross infirmary temporarily set up to care for those wounded in the war. Slowly, we discover that one, then another, then seven in all of the Sisters are near birth of children fostered by the ungodly rape perpetrated against them by the invading Russian soldiers. Not only have their vows of chastity been violated but their shame hangs over the monastery like a merciless winter that may never end. Their very lives, and that of the soon to be born, are also at risk given the lack of care they have received, the Spartan environment of the monastery itself, and the complications and illnesses some of them face.
One of the Novices (yet to take her vows) secretly steals away from the convent to find a doctor in the town, a French doctor “…not a Polish or Russian one.” She pays street children a token to take her to find a doctor at the French Red Cross station. So begins the inspirational collision of these two worlds.
While the Novice cannot get through to a physician, she finds a physician’s assistant, able beyond her training and qualifications, in many ways. But she, Matilde (Lou de Laâge), refuses the Sister’s request, telling her to find help from the Poles. The Sister is expelled from the Red Cross headquarters but kneels nearby, on frozen land, praying, which Matilde notices some time afterward and her heart is captured. She steals away as well from her cloister, taking a Red Cross jeep and a medical bag, and arrives at the convent in the dead of night, which is to become her portal to finding her cause, her mission, her heart.
This is a film by a woman director (Anne Fontaine), about women, and about war – but it goes well beyond those rich subjects to consider the Catholic Church, Communism and the power of community. Two other women actors add to Lou de Laâge’s performance brilliance: Agata Buzek, who plays Maria the lovely, earthly second in charge, and Agata Kulesza, who plays the Mother Abesse (some may remember her stunning role as the Aunt in Ida, the Oscar winning Polish film from 2014). Kulesza’s acting realizes, again, the cold face of reality, being the representative of a rigid institution, and the self-sacrifice that is expected under the most awful of situations. But it is not she, it is Maria and Matilde who find a way to grace and to life.
Men don’t come across very well in this film. The Russians are like animals, the Poles shaking in their boots, and even the French doctors are flawed and given to being officious. I thought the doctors didn’t quite get a fair shake (but I am a doctor) since they were doing God’s work for no real compensation, except of course saving lives in locations remote from their home, families and opportunity.
What was so compelling to me about the film was what it took to rise above the extraordinary dilemma, the ignominy and the brutal choice - ostensibly between their infants and God - that the Sisters faced. It was not the problem solving or the bravery of the individual women (which was heart rending) but rather the power of their attachment to each other, to a community, which by the grace of God found that by building on what they had, opening their doors to the urchin children of the village, they could be mothers in every sense of the word.

Right? We can all agree on that.
That said, we can’t help but quietly enjoy the new iOS sticker pack Grammar Snob, which allows users to overlay red-pencil corrections of common grammar, spelling and usage errors onto their iMessage chats.
Corrections for a few particular peeves of ours appear in the set, including lose/loose, couldn’t care less, and properly placed apostrophes.
As much as an editor’s soul might warm to more red-pencil marks everywhere, does the world really need more pedantry? Mashable, Engadget and The Verge snarked that Grammar Snob is “the perfect app for people who are objectively the worst,” “ready to ruin your friendships,” and a way to “make enemies for life,” respectively.
Yes, the power to bring conversation to a screeching halt by boldly and colorfully humiliating your interlocutor’s adherence to standard written English is a mighty one, and it must be wielded with care.
Here are some general guidelines:
DON’T correct your best friend’s spelling of “lose” vs. “loose” when she sends you an emotional text about the death of her beloved pet rabbit.
DO correct your frenemy’s use of “could care less” when she messages you something callous about the death of your best friend’s rabbit.
DON’T scratch out “expresso” in a second date invitation from a promising suitor, overlaying it with a chilly “espresso.”
DO scratch out “your” in a bitter text from a Tinder match who’d been unsuccessfully angling for a booty call, overlaying it with “you’re.” (”You’re a frigid bitch” is much more grammatically satisfying to read.)
And of course, always remember that correcting others’ grammar can be classist, ignorant of variants in dialect, and might make you look like the fool yourself. 
With immense emotional power comes immense responsibility, young texters. Use these Grammar Snob stickers, but don’t use them thoughtlessly ― unless you wish to find yourself without annoying Tinder bros and bosom friends alike.

32,ARTS & CULTURE,Casper’s Traffic Box Program Turns Intersections Into Public Art,"Beth Andress, ContributorCoordinator, Keep Casper Beautiful program",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/caspers-traffic-box-program-turns-intersections-into-public-art_us_59df9540e4b0fdad73b2b835,The project started as a way to deter vandalism.,2017-10-12,ARTS & CULTURE,"Being stopped at a red light is an aggravating experience, even in a smaller city such as Casper, Wyoming, where an across-town commute may only last 20 minutes. It takes valuable time out of the day and can make you late. It’s also not very interesting or thought-provoking. But what if idling at an intersection was a beautiful experience?
Roadside beautification projects are nothing new. Highways, freeways and major intersections have been treated to beauty regimens for decades. Since 1965, highways across the country have benefitted from the Highway Beautification Act, and one can hardly drive across the country without noticing a bevy of flowers, trees and, in some places in the southwest, rock art. 
But left out of this campaign were the many intersections and strips of roadways that traverse cities throughout the country.
Many towns and cities have begun to beautify the daily commute with flowers, trees and public art. Casper’s traffic box program seeks to take the mundane and ordinary control boxes of hated red lights and make them a masterpiece of public art. Something worth pausing for.
The project started as a way to deter vandalism, a way for the traffic department to get out of the task of cleaning crude words, symbols and sophomoric scribblings off the boxes, but it’s become one of the more popular programs of Keep Casper Beautiful. It started in 2010 with one experimental box. The box remained untouched by vandalism for seven years.
In 2016, Keep Casper Beautiful received the go ahead from Casper Public Services to start a traffic box program, and four boxes downtown were wrapped with original art work. Keep Casper Beautiful worked with the local artists guild on an open call to all artists within the county. A few submissions were received, and a panel selected three works. The public voted on a fourth. In 2017, Keep Casper Beautiful again put out a call to artists county-wide and received three times as many submissions as 2016. Clearly, word was spreading among artists that this was a public art project that would be worth the work of a submittal. Five more boxes were wrapped using the same panel and public vote process.
Calls and letters started to come into the Downtown Development Authority office praising the art and the effort. Keep Casper Beautiful receives calls and comments on social media regularly concerning the art. Happy citizens and visitors even call City Hall to express their appreciation. Artists often call the office to make sure they did not miss the call to artists. Keep Casper Beautiful has plans to continue wrapping traffic boxes each year. 
The cost to the program is minimal. Artists receive a small fee for the use of their art but maintain the rights to the work. The vinyl wraps are sometimes donated, leaving labor for installation as the only cost. 
At $2,000 each year, the program budget is small and more attainable than some public art projects, which can cost a city tens of thousands of dollars for one work. Printed vinyl was chosen to keep costs low and to ensure that boxes could easily be cleaned should they be vandalized. Among the most debated items on the budget sheet is the artist fee. 
Some have felt that recognition is enough payment, while some have felt that the fee should be raised. As the Keep Casper Beautiful director and a performing artist myself, I have always felt that artists should be paid for their work and that exposure is not payment. The opportunities for paid work are often few and far between in small communities. Often, lesser-known local artists are left out of public art projects completely, as they are either not invited to submit or lack the qualifications to meet the standards set by the request for proposals. Currently, I support the modest fee, as it encourages an array of artists to submit work and does not intimidate young or amateur artists who may have never sold work. I also firmly believe the project has support of local artists because of the fee payment. Local artists want paid opportunities in their communities, and they want some of those opportunities to be public art.
While the public art project is not groundbreaking ― we are not the first organization to decorate traffic control boxes, nor are we the first to use public art to transform spaces and deter vandalism ― it is transforming the way people in Casper, Wyoming view public art. If anything, the program has taught Casperites that public art doesn’t have to be grand statues or huge murals. It can be transforming the ordinary, everyday objects into the extraordinary. Art can be part of the daily grind, making us want to pause maybe just a little longer.

Sure, each season starts out with a few black, biracial, and occasional Latina or Asian contestants splashed into the mix -- especially as the show has aged and confronted criticism and a lawsuit about its whiteness -- but really just enough to dim the ""Aryan Dating Game"" aura over the whole affair. On ""The Bachelor,"" our country's race issues are most apparent by how invisible race (and non-whiteness in general) is.
For Lifetime scripted drama ""UnREAL,"" which revolves around a fictional reality dating show called ""Everlasting,"" the move to cast a black bachelor -- the crushworthy B.J. Britt as NFL quarterback Darius Beck -- took just two seasons. And they're not stopping with that superficial nod to racial politics. With the second season poised to premiere Monday at 10 p.m., previews have already revealed that the edgy show will dive right into the complex and layered issues of racial representation and tokenism, liberal paternalism, veiled bigotry and how these intractable problems can interact explosively with television networks' thirst for ratings and social media chatter.
Prior to the show's premiere, co-creator Sarah Gertrude Shapiro and showrunner Carol Barbee spoke frankly with HuffPost's Bachelor recap podcast, ""Here to Make Friends,"" about the nerve-wracking decision to make Season 2 of ""UnREAL"" revolve around race, and about how the show's writers worked to address those narratives accurately, sensitively and fearlessly.
On the decision to cast a black suitor:
Sarah Gertrude Shapiro: I came into the room this year after having talked to Carol about what I wanted to do, and then put it to the writers' room -- there are two women of color in our room, and [I] definitely gave them primary importance in that conversation -- and just said, this is what I would like to do this season, and I know it's really problematic. I'm really scared. I feel like it's going to be pretty uncomfortable at times. I feel like it's worth doing. Do you guys feel like it's worth doing? We had that conversation and it felt like everybody was on board, and it did feel worth doing.
On listening to writers of color when making a show about race:
Shapiro: [...] The first couple of weeks, a lot what we did was have those few writers talk about their experience as black women in terms of dating, and also there were conversations about football and black men, and violence against black men, and men in the media, and what it means to have a black romantic lead. We just spent a lot of time talking, and letting them talk and listening, because I think that was really important to me -- that we weren't prescribing what we should do, but that we were just listening to what their experience actually was. And then they pretty much had free rein for the rest of the season that, if they felt like we weren't hitting it right, to nix it. 
And then we had to go about just writing a TV show and coming up with the most interesting plot, but I think there were some really primary things put in place. I was shocked. I think, in those two weeks, I learned more about race than I could even have imagined, and I feel like I'm a person who's paid a lot of attention to it, but specifically some of the problems with white feminism when it comes to black women. That was something that I had peripherally thought about but I hadn't just actually sat and listened to two black women tell me about their experiences with it, and that was super informative to how we wrote Rachel and Ruby, who is the black activist character.
On capturing the humanity underlying the racial conflicts:
Carol Barbee: I'm from the South, I'm from North Carolina, and I've written about race a lot, it creeps into everything because it's the world I have always lived in. [...] So what I kept saying all along the way was, I'm all about writing about race, but let's just make sure that we do it in a really specific, truthful way, because what's really hard as a Southerner is when you see these stories told, the Southerners are all caricatures. [...] 
So that was my thing all the way through, was making sure that, literally, the character of Beth Ann, who's got the Confederate flag bikini on -- which is insane, like, the Confederate flag is the most hateful symbol, and it is in the South as well, there's a very small group of people who will say otherwise, so I know how offensive that symbol is. But to make that character real, and to have her be someone with a point of view where she's just never been outside of her own circle of family and friends, and she's just never been to the wider world and she's never questioned her beliefs or her bikini. Until she does. And what I love, love, love is how there's a line in there -- she actually falls in love with Darius while she's wearing a bikini with the Confederate flag, and there's this idea that racism is confusing, and race is confusing, and that's how it is in the South. [...]
I think everyone starts the season out, including the black bachelor, saying ""I'm not about race, I don't have a big opinion, we're doing this because it'll be noisy television"" -- but there comes a point in the season where nobody can stay on the fence anymore, where everybody has to figure out where they are.
On Rachel as white feminist:
Shapiro: It's also such great story fodder, also for Jay, who's a really wonderful character on our show, he's one of the other producers and he's black, and I think it was such great story fodder in terms of activating him, because Rachel brings in a black suitor, is taking all this credit for it, patting herself on the back for it, and treating him like a peon, ordering him around in terms of serving her greater purpose. The complexities of that are so fucked up and so hard to even look at. But that's when we were having the conversations about white feminism and white liberalism, and the privileges of having a liberal arts education and feeling really holier-than-thou, and the white paternalism of coming in and being like, ""I know better for you guys, I'm going to save you and I'll make a right decision."" We really thought about it in terms of Rachel just, again, patting herself on the back and taking credit for something she couldn't possibly understand.
On beating ""The Bachelor"" franchise to casting a black bachelor:
Shapiro: It wasn't the reason to do it. I think for me it was like, we have a platform; we have a responsibility to do something with that platform. We are what we are as a TV show, but I think that, again, it was one of the reasons we all held hands and said, ""Let's do this,"" because it was better than not doing it. Even though it is problematic, even though it's a show run by two white women. That is problematic, but it's still worth doing.
It just takes the balls to do it even though you might get in trouble or even though ad sales might not like it, or whatever it is that scares [""The Bachelor""]. It's just taking that leap. And I think... it's time. 
Barbee: And not to sound too much like Quinn, but I really feel like in television the only safe place is the not safe place. The only place to really have a show that matters or that gets any sort of eyeballs on it is to do things that provoke, and I think it's a good conversation to have. 
Shapiro: I think that it's legitimately scary for them because I think that a black man dating white women is still really controversial in 2016, and I think that is absolutely insane, but it appears to be true. [...]
I also think it is a little antiquated. It does feel a little bit behind the times to me that they really feel like it would take down the show or that people would lose their jobs. I'm not sure that that's accurate at this point.
On not playing it safe: 
Shapiro: It definitely never felt safe. It never felt like a safe zone. It wasn't like we got to a place where we were like, ""Oh, we're bullet-proof, nobody's going to freak out on Twitter. We are goodhearted people trying to do the best we can to write this story as honestly and humanly as we can, and we're probably going to fuck up at some point, but we think it's worth doing.""

35,ARTS & CULTURE,"In A Time Of Demagogy, Author Sees True Humanity In Immigrants",Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vanessa-hua-deceit-and-other-possibilities_us_580143bde4b0162c043c1729,"In a short story debut, Vanessa Hua draws the reader in with her power of perception.",2016-10-14,ARTS & CULTURE,"The opening line of Vanessa Hua’s debut collection is so bold in its address, it almost feels like a direct question from her to the reader: “Perhaps you’ve heard of me?” 
The narrator lists his many accomplishments, then concludes, “I didn’t think so.” Kingsway Lee, despite his film and pop music bona fides, is a superstar only in Hong Kong, where his American upbringing and swagger effortlessly won him celebrity. Now on a return flight to his hometown, Oakland, he’s shedding all that fame as easily as he acquired it just by switching locations. It’s a tradeoff he’s willing to make, since a hacker leaked thousands of lewd photos from his cell phone. In America he’s not a beloved star, but he’s also not famous enough to be harassed by paparazzi or outraged fans. 
Unfortunately, he soon learns that crossing the ocean might have stripped him of the warm glow of adulation ― “How dim, my star across the Pacific,” he muses ― but it hasn’t freed him from the negative externalities. Soon after he arrives at home, journalists show up on his parents’ doorstep and interrogate him in front of neighbors, including a former classmate to whom he felt a burgeoning attraction. “I can’t start over fresh with her,” Kingsway realizes. “It isn’t a chance I’m certain I want, or even a chance I’m certain I had, but the loss stings all the same.” It’s all the curse, none of the blessing. In this globalized world, he can’t take his celebrity with him, but his infamy will follow him everywhere. 
Venturing across boundaries both tangible and imperceptible, legal and emotional, can carry tremendous weight in Deceit and Other Possibilities. Throughout Hua’s collection, written over the course of over 10 years, she tells the stories of people who have crossed borders despite all that they must leave behind in the process, or who choose to cross back despite all that they’ve gained in their new world. 
In “For What They Shared,” a Chinese immigrant couple and the wife’s parents share a Big Sur campsite with a raucous group of 20-somethings, including Aileen, a Chinese-American woman joining her white boyfriend’s buddies for an expedition. Lin, the wife, knows her parents want her to return to China with her husband and start a family. She’s hoping the idyllic camping trip will persuade them that she’s right to stay in California. Aileen wants to be accepted by her boyfriend’s group, even as she’s uncomfortable with their casual privilege. On each side, a woman wavering in a liminal space ― to choose America or China, to stand with the people who share her background or the people who share her camp. 
Another story, “Accepted,” might niggle at buried memory in readers’ brains: Like an actual news story from 2007, it revolves around a driven Korean-American high school student who pretends to attend Stanford as a student on campus for months, though she was actually rejected by admissions. Elaine Park, the narrator of the story, can’t bear to tell her parents that she’s been denied by the only college they’ve dreamed of and prepared her to attend. Instead, she quietly pretends that she got in, sneaks onto campus, convinces a freshman to let her crash indefinitely in a dorm room, and attends classes for which she’ll never get grades. She applies to Stanford again, convinced the first rejection was a mistake. She joins ROTC, slipping through the cracks opened up in the gap between Stanford and the military organization, which isn’t officially affiliated with the school. In Hua’s heart-wrenching, implacable story, Elaine is transformed from a news curiosity to a human teeming with painful, contradictory impulses. She’s desperate to cross over into the world of the legitimate, the accepted, but when her path is blocked, she collapses.
Hua’s strongest stories live here, in the muddled hearts of people seeking their home or their way forward ― an elderly man who has returned home to China to visit his still-more aged mother, only to find that the entire village is determined to marry one of their daughters off to the wealthy American uncle; a gay man who can’t bring himself to come out to his Chinese immigrant parents despite being in a committed relationship.
On a prose and plot level, however, the book often slips ― perhaps unsurprising from a debut short story collection written over such a long span of time. When a story rests on a narrative device or shocking conclusion, like the morally compromising denouement to the final story in the collection, “The Deal,” Hua’s pacing often feels off, providing both too many of the wrong details and too few of the necessary ones to build tension. She has a gift for opening sentences that pull the reader in, but endings are trickier ― sometimes powerful, sometimes stumbled over. “Camping had fooled her into thinking that she belonged where she did not, as if the equipment alone could guarantee happiness and safe passage,” one story concludes with an almost pedagogic tinge. The prose, sometimes clear and effortless, can also be stilted, as in this passage.
Although Deceit and Other Possibilities isn’t highly polished, it’s easy to keep reading, perhaps because many of the characters within feel so human and in need of being heard. With Hua’s debut novel forthcoming from Ballantine, readers beguiled by her depth of psychological insight will be eager to see what she can elicit from her characters in the span of a book-length narrative. 
The Bottom Line:
In an uneven short story debut, Hua draws the reader in with her power of perception.
What other reviewers think:
Booklist: “Hua’s ability to imagine the detailed lives of her disparate characters, including a sex-scandal runaway, missionary saviors, and a lock-picking immigrant, gives her stories impact, despite a few jarring endings.”
San Francisco Chronicle: “Above all, she has a deep understanding of the pressure of submerged emotions and polite, face-saving deceptions. The truth comes out, sometimes explosively, sometimes in a quiet act of courage.”
Who wrote it?
Vanessa Hua, a San Francisco Chronicle columnist, is also the author of a novel forthcoming from Ballantine. Her short stories have appeared in The Atlantic, The American Literary Review, Hopkins Review, and more. Deceit and Other Possibilities is her debut collection.
Who will read it?
Readers interested in questions of identity and belonging.
Opening lines:
“Perhaps you’ve heard of me? 
“Maybe you’ve listened to a song by the Jump Boys, a group I fronted, which had three gold records that launched countless jingles for a remarkable array of consumer products. Or on television, as the host of a reality show where contestants dared to eat horse cock sandwiches and cling to helicopters zooming over a tropical bay. On billboards, hawking heavy gold watches, cask-aged cognac, or alligator leather shoes, my shirt unbuttoned to reveal six-pack abs.
“I didn’t think so.”
Notable passage:
“The rejection from Admissions was a mistake. That’s what I told myself after I clicked on the link and logged onto the portal last spring. Stanford had denied another Elaine Park, another in Irvine who’d also applied. I waited for a phone call of apology, along with an e-mail with the correct link.
“I hadn’t meant to lie, not at first, but when Jack Min donned his Stanford sweatshirt after receiving his acceptance (a senior tradition) ― I yanked my Cardinal red hoodie out of my locker. When my AP English teacher, Ms. Banks, stopped to congratulate me, I couldn’t bring myself to say, not yet.”

Almost featureless nude figures cavort or repose in geometrically iterated positions, set against flattened beige backgrounds. The world, in these scenes, appears harmonious and placid: Mankind at peace. 
“I’m interested in our search for a sense of belonging and meaning as individuals, and how that both contrasts and combines with our existential concerns of feeling small or insignificant in the larger world,” Berger told The Huffington Post in an email. She wants to capture “the ideas of inclusion and interconnectedness” in these works. 
To evoke the profound underlying unity of the human race, she portrays the figures with pin-prick eyes and mouths, generic hairstyles and no secondary sex characteristics, á la Ken. (Barbie is different, thanks to the bosom.) “I’m ... trying to distill the environments and figures down to very minimal clean shapes as a way to really focus on emotion or story, color and composition,” she told HuffPost.
The earthy, warm colors of Berger’s paintings play into her peaceful aesthetic and the rosy browns of her scenes look visually reminiscent of ancient Greek pottery paintings ― which she cites as an influence. “I’m really fascinated by ancient art that looks like it could have been made in contemporary time ― things like Japanese prints, Nayarit sculpture, Native American textiles and ledger drawings, Indonesian paintings, the modern illustrative style on Grecian vessels,” she explained. “But I’m equally interested in really abstract, graphic work. I love the large, clean shapes in paintings by Carmen Herrera, for instance, or the loose free-flowing forms and color fields in Helen Frankenthaler’s work.”
The confluence of ancient and contemporary aesthetics infuses her paintings with a timelessness, a visual representation of humanity that seems suspended in amber. “When you take away everything that the world puts upon us, we are all just these beings that are so similar and so connected to each other and to our collective global history,” she said.
The patterns of human figures and clean backgrounds have a geometric balance that juxtaposes with the soft bodily curves and muted palette Berger depicts. “I guess it’s sort of how life is, so that’s interesting to me,” she said. Depending on how you look at it, the human condition is either squishy and random or guided by primordial patterns ― or maybe it’s both.
In her paintings, humanity isn’t divided by gender, color or class; they move as one. There’s a deeper pattern beneath the seemingly fragmented and squishy categories of people. On a cosmic level, the paintings seem to say that we have more in common than we have dividing us. ”Much of my focus has been around exploring alternate notions of ‘family’ and connection ― through our ties to the global community and to our collective ancestry, to nature and to the unknown,” Berger added. Her works soothe, suggesting a likely impossible vision of global cooperation and mutual respect. 
In the real world, we do wear clothes that mark our socioeconomic statuses; we have sex organs and we engage in vicious partisan battles instead of collaborating peacefully to build a society together. In looking at Berger’s wistful paintings, we can imagine a better way.

37,ARTS & CULTURE,'Sheeple' Has Been Added To The Dictionary,Jenna Amatulli,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sheeple-has-been-added-to-the-dictionary_us_59021414e4b081a5c0fb9b77,Is Merriam-Webster throwing shade at the current political climate? Hmm...,2017-04-27,ARTS & CULTURE,"We all know Merriam-Webster rivals Hannah Horvath in being the voice of our generation. The dictionary is also very involved in the Twitterverse, particularly when it comes to politics, subtly throwin’ shade like it ain’t no thang.
So, it makes sense for this to be the latest Merriam-Webster addition: “Sheeple.”
“Sheeple,” a portmanteau of “sheep” and “people,” is defined as “people who are docile, compliant or easily influenced.”
Because, you know, sheep are really chill and can be pretty much herded wherever. It’s similar in sentiment to the word “lemming.”
Merriam-Webster uses the word in a sentence that hits deeply close to home: “Apple’s debuted a battery case for the juice-sucking iPhone — an ungainly lumpy case the sheeple will happily shell out $99 for.”
But, despite that iPhone realness, the most-known example of the word is likely “Wake up, sheeple!”
The phrase “wake up, sheeple!” has been around for years, but appears to have become a well-circulated meme after appearing in an “xkcd” web comic from 2012. The comic, according to Know Your Meme, is about “a civilization of sheep-people hybrids who are awakened from their underground slumber after a man yells, ‘Wake up, Sheeple!’”
That’s obviously incredibly literal, but “sheeple” has also been used as a politically-charged word ― apparently since the 1940s.
W. R. Anderson, in his column “Round About Radio,” published this line in 1945: “The simple truth is that you can get away with anything, in government. That covers almost all the evils of the time. Once in, nobody, apparently, can turn you out. The People, as ever (I spell it ‘Sheeple’), will stand anything.”
More recently, in 2004, an Urban Dictionary entry gave a usage example stating that sheeple supported the war on terrorism:
Hmm... By adding “sheeple” to the dictionary now, in 2017, could Merriam-Webster be making another kind of statement?

It's about time.",2017-06-15,ARTS & CULTURE,"After 46 years, Yoko Ono is finally receiving the credit she deserves. The iconic multidisciplinary artist was officially credited as a co-writer of the 1971 song “Imagine,” currently attributed to Ono’s deceased husband, John Lennon. 
The news was announced Wednesday at a meeting of the National Music Publishers Association by its CEO, David Israelite. He also bestowed “Imagine” with the Centennial Song award. 
“While things may have been different in 1971, today I am glad to say things have changed,” Israelite said. “So tonight it is my distinct honor to correct the record some 48 years later and recognize Yoko Ono as a co-writer of the NMPA centennial song ‘Imagine,’ and to present Yoko Ono with this well-deserved credit.”
He then played an archival interview, in which Lennon explains that the song would not exist without Ono. “[Imagine] should be credited as a Lennon-Ono song,” he said. “Because a lot of it — the lyric and the concept — came from Yoko. But those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, and I sort of omitted to mention her contribution. But it was right out of Grapefruit, her book. There’s a whole pile of pieces about ‘imagine this’ and ‘imagine that.’”
Seven years before “Imagine,” Ono self-published Grapefruit, a little gem of a book, unruly and quiet at once, filled with strange wishes and demands. “Imagine your body spreading rapidly all over the world like thin tissue,” one line reads. “Imagine cutting out one part of the tissue.” 
Sean Lennon accompanied his mother, Ono, who uses a wheelchair, onstage to accept the Centennial Song award. According to Lennon, the artist welled up with tears upon hearing the announcement. Onstage, Ono said her waning health has heightened her appreciation of the song and imbued her with a magnified esteem for being alive, Variety reported.
“This is the best time of my life,” she said, to applause.
Congratulations, Yoko. It’s about time.

Many celebrants are also participating in a strike, “Day Without a Woman,” which asks that women refrain from paid or unpaid work. The strike comes as a response to the various Women’s Marches in January that gathered women all over the country (and the world) in response to the inauguration of President Donald Trump. 
 Because not all women can refrain from work, however, many are showing their solidarity by wearing red and shopping less ― and some are displaying support through social media. Letters Of Note, a digital collection of “fascinating letters, postcards, telegrams, faxes, and memos,” has done just that by sharing empowering letters written by women over Twitter on Wednesday.

""Every painting, every sculpture, every piece of music strove to be beautiful.""
Pim is a 28-year-old street artist, born in West Belfast, whose murals adorn abandoned spaces sprinked throughout the U.S. and Europe. Yet rather than communicating in the typical street art language of bold graphics, colorful geometry and politically-bent symbols, Pim uses a visual lexicon employed by artists like Rembrandt and Caravaggio. One of dark shadows, rich tones and an excess of grandeur.
""Coming out of one of the most deprived and poverty stricken areas in Western Europe, I was always fascinated with wealth and luxury,"" Pim explained. ""When I was dragged to the local Catholic church as a child, I used to love sitting and staring at the fine art on display and motifs dripping in gold ... I liked the idea of being able to create a luxury product out of nothing, so I started painting Baroque-inspired pieces.""
While the majority of such opulent artworks hang in museums, cordoned off by velvet ropes and glass barriers, Pim prefers his gold-tinged depictions in decrepit urban environments.
""I was drawn to abandoned buildings as I liked the contrast of painting detailed, Baroque-inspired pieces inside dark, neglected structures. These buildings provided me with the perfect atmosphere to create my pieces, with the end result often reflecting my surroundings -- haunting, dark figures.""
Pim hypothesized his predilection for abandoned buildings references the neglected area he called home growing up. 
The juxtaposition between palatial artwork and dingy architecture is striking to be sure. And that's just the reaction Pim hopes for. ""I like strong reactions, disturbing and entering the viewers' mind,"" he said. ""I remember the feeling I had after seeing Francis Bacon’s 'Head II' as a child at the Ulster Museum in Belfast. I’ve tried to recreate that reaction in my own artwork.""

Mason whipped out her handy Internet-based alter ego FutureClown to do what she does best, reenact the whole disastrous event. ""I have just been mesmerized by the debates as a public spectacle,"" Mason told The Huffington Post, ""and obviously with Donald Trump being a viable candidate, it really blurs the line between reality and fiction.""
In the video above, Mason dons white face paint, sad clown makeup and a typical jester ensemble. Illuminated by an ominous red glow, FutureClown perfectly lip-syncs every word that came out of the mouths of Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Jeb Bush. Yes, Mason achieved the near impossible task of making Trump look more clownish than he's already appeared.
You'll feel an indescribable urge to giggle and vomit when you see FutureClown, with the voice of Ben Carson, pronounce: ""We need to make sure any place -- I don't care if it's a mosque, a school, a theater, it doesn't matter! If there are a lot of people getting there, engaging and radicalizing activities, we need to be suspicious of it. We need to get rid of all this PC stuff. People are worried about -- people are going to say that I'm Islamophobic or what have you. This is craziness!"" 
Despite being very politically engaged, FutureClown will abstain from voting come the 2016 election. ""FutureClown doesn't vote,"" Mason said. ""I view candidates as people who are obsessed with winning. And candidates on both sides, left and right, have much more in common with each other than almost anyone else. It really is an outrageous thing to want to be the president of any country. I truly question the motivation of anyone that wants to do it. And that includes candidates whose views I support.""

43,ARTS & CULTURE,What Would You Do To Spend Valentine's Day With A 'Bachelor' Star?,Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bachelor-auction-ashley-iaconetti-nick-viall_us_56c35350e4b0b40245c7f7f0,"Would you wait in a coat-check line for an hour? Would you battle through hundreds of other women? Would you pay $5,000?",2016-02-16,ARTS & CULTURE,"It’s 9:30 p.m. on a frigid NYC Valentine’s Day, and JJ Lane, recent alum of “The Bachelorette” and “Bachelor in Paradise,” is standing on a banquette at The Ainsworth in Chelsea, hollering insults at former co-star Joshua Albers. 
The target of Lane’s playful wrath continues to smile gamely through selfies with eager young women, all dressed in their rose ceremony best (lace bodycon dresses, teetering heels, sequins), as Lane gives Albers the finger. The semicircle of ladies gathered around Lane, in as many tight rows as an onion has layers, grows fidgety. “JJ, get down here,” one yells, grabbing at him. 
The “Bachelor” fans are here for charity, and they need their selfies.
A few weeks ago, I thought I’d spend Valentine’s Day the normal way -- on the couch, ordering calorie-dense takeout and scrolling through the on-demand options for a few hours with my fiancé. Sometimes, though, duty calls. Duty doesn’t care about your brick oven pizza plans. When I heard tell of a New York City-area charity auction and watch party for the 20th anniversary “Bachelor” special hosted by Ashley Iaconetti (she of the teary lashes), I knew my night would be spent marinating in a -- er -- different kind of romantic atmosphere. Emma Gray, who co-hosts HuffPost’s “Bachelor” podcast “Here to Make Friends” with me, would be on a well-deserved vacation, so I would be repping the podcast alone, and I was ready.
Without doubt, it would be the most fan-favorite-filled night in “Bachelor” history. Aside from Iaconetti, “Bachelorette” icons including Nick Viall, Jared Haibon, JJ Lane and Ben Zorn would be auctioning off a precious hour of their time to benefit THON, all while the year’s most adorable reality TV couple, Jade Roper and Tanner Tolbert, tied the knot on approximately 47 hi-def TVs all around the venue. 
I bought a ticket -- $65, to benefit charity. Cocktail attire was requested, perhaps in order to create a natural habitat for our “Bachelor” stars. I curled my hair and eyelashes and put on a dress I would describe as “from Urban Outfitters.” I also put on a coat I would describe as “enormous,” because it was 2 degrees out, and sallied forth. I had lip gloss in my purse. My heart was open. My “please come on HuffPost’s reality TV podcast” pitch was ready. “Can I steal you for a second?” hung on the tip of my tongue. This journey was just beginning.
When I arrived, the first thing I noticed was the coat check. Several minutes later, I noticed the line for the coat check, which was not where I thought it was. The 45 minutes I ultimately spent in this line, while frustrating, especially as I did not arrive with a buddy to send off to the bar for coat check line drinks, did at least provide me with ample opportunity to scope out the crowd. 
It was very, very female. I saw a couple of men, who were pretty clearly attentive significant others or the advertised “Bachelorette” stars. But that’s hardly a surprise, given that the show is coded so female -- most women showed up in pairs or small gaggles, while it may be more embarrassing for even men who enjoy the show to admit to friends they’d like to go. Besides, Iaconetti was the only advertised gal on the auction block. At the event, she herself told Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan, the fashion bloggers known as the Fug Girls, that male fans often seem to watch the show along with their wives or girlfriends and approach her simply to say hi, not hit on her. 
For the Nicks and Joshes in the club, the fan attention leaned more carnal. A handful of the endless waves of women in attendance seemed like sweet, eager fans, fresh-faced in flat shoes and everyday hair, just looking for a moment with their favorites; the majority looked ready to volunteer for a sudden opening in one of the “Bachelor” limos. Professional blowouts and barrel curls bristled in every direction. The eyeliner game on display made me ashamed of my own half-hearted smoky eye. Dresses had been chosen to flaunt curves; heels for their pencil-slim height. Manicured hands clutched at rose-hued cocktails as necks craned searchingly, seeking any nearby “Bachelorette” heartthrob. 
When the “Bachelor” bachelor auction started, this attention became more focused, as all the semi-celebs were pulled up to the auction block. Nick Viall was entrusted with auctioning off his compatriots, starting with Ben Zorn, a clumsily hunky fan favorite who quickly sold for around $1,200, despite some confusion amongst the auctioneers about who was actually bidding and who was just being effusive. (This would be a problem throughout the night.) A lull followed, as Albers, Lane and Josh Murray went for prices in the high hundreds. Jared Haibon, the sweet bartender adored by viewers -- and Ashley Iaconetti -- modestly cracked a thousand. Michael Garofola, an NYC-based attorney, leveraged his purportedly cute new puppy to sell himself for over $5,000, as Iaconetti and Viall clearly began to feel a bit intimidated by the realness of the money being pledged. Iaconetti went up for auction, though I didn’t spot a single unattached man present except for those onstage. Her friend Haibon gallantly snatched her up for around $700, then stepped up to shill the inimitable Viall himself, a two-time ""Bachelorette"" runner-up, to the crowd. Not much shilling was needed, and the frenzied bidding war ultimately carried the prices up to an all-night high of $5,600. (I mean, he is a pretty decent conversationalist.)
As the auction ended, the stars dutifully spread through the club, circulating among the non-auction winners for selfies (in her pre-event message, Iaconetti requested “as few retakes as possible”). Almost immediately, each man found himself the sun at the center of a tightly swirling solar system of squealing, iPhone-wielding women. A couple rows back, the ladies were more calm and calculated, scanning the room for a better Bachelor, or a Bachelor with a smaller crowd around him to penetrate, or just casually judging (“Ugh, I just don’t get it,” you’d hear in passing as a small gaggle of girls swept disdainfully past Haibon as he held court). 
In my personal life, I have a deeply socialized desire not to seem pushy or demanding that overcomes me at events like this. It’s partly why the aggressiveness of the other female fans present awes me. How did these women escape the near-universal messaging that men hate forwardness, that acting semi-predatory will seem grotesque and unladylike? Lane himself told me later that he actually relishes rejecting women who approach him, a satisfying reversal of the mating role he’s used to. Is the fandom of Bachelor Nation's women stronger than their socialization? Are they refusing to let their fears hold them back from what they want? Is society truly getting more equal? I put this complex anthropological question aside as I elbowed through a tight knot of women to introduce myself successively to Lane, Albers, Iaconetti, and Haibon. I was there to make professional contact. But also, I felt a little flutter of excitement in my stomach. I was actually seeing these people in real life. 
I mean, not that I care.
Soon, the night started to wind down. The “Bachelor” alumni were scheduled to end the evening with 45 minutes of one-on-one time with their winning bidders in the VIP area at the back of the club, and the rest of us filtered out. 
Well, most of us. Viall told me the next day, as he and Lane joined me on the podcast, that his second-place bidder hung around meaningfully, waiting for him to finish his bought-and-paid-for date so she could whisk him away herself, despite the numerous requests to leave.  
And it wasn’t just during the auction date -- watching “The Bachelor” had seemingly induced some bad habits all around. “Some women would come up,” Viall said, wincing, “and be like, ‘Hey, can I steal you…’ and I’d be like, ‘I can’t really leave.’” The ladies of NYC were there for their romantic meet-cute, one worthy of the show itself. (Actually, he emphasized, the vast majority of them were very nice and appreciative of their selfie moment and brief chat. For the record.) “Our lives suck,” joked Lane, who seemed simultaneously exhilarated and exhausted by the avalanche of female scrutiny and desire.
Ah, to both long for and fear the demands of romantic attention from the opposite sex -- what's that's like? ""The Bachelor"" dudes might just be experiencing what it's like to be the hot girl at the bar, but more so, and as we all know, that's a position that's fraught with both benefits and serious drawbacks. But for Lane, Viall and co., there isn't much time to ponder this: They've got selfies to take.

The controversial artwork appeared in Phoenix on Friday. In the days since, California-based artist Karen Fiorito says she’s received death threats.
“I think a lot of people are feeling this way and I’m just trying to express what I think is on a lot of people’s minds these days,” she told local news operation 12 News. “Something that really concerned us was this idea of a dictatorship where things were going in a certain direction.”
The billboard space was provided by the owner, Beatrice Moore, who 12 News reported has offered to showcase the work for the remainder of Trump’s presidency. 
On the back of the billboard, there’s another message. It reads “unity” both in English and in sign language.
Of course, not everyone is on board with the sign, even those who say they’re fine with an anti-Trump message.
“It’s pretty drastic, I thought swastikas were very crude and violent,” neighbor Jeff Whitman told AZ Family.com. He suggested more family-friendly symbols instead.
“Maybe put some thumbs down up there around Trump or something but I don’t like waking up to the Nazi signs,” he told Arizona Central.
Passerby Astrid Olafsen, however, threw support behind the sign, particularly the front and back contrast.
“I think that it’s a wonderful expression of the two sides of the opinions of what is going on and how we can move forward,” she told Arizona Central.
Jeremy Bacpac also shared her approval of the imagery. 
“It’s fantastic. I think this is what artists are supposed to do, make statements, whether you agree or not, it’s a statement,” she told ABC 15.
On Friday, Fiorito posted on Facebook that she expected “death threats and the like” over the work. There appeared to be mixed reviews on her page’s comment section, one calling her a “racist pig” and another thanking her for her “amazing, insightful artwork.”

It’s time to change that.",2016-01-25,ARTS & CULTURE,"In the otherwise cheery suburban dwellings of North America lives a lethargic subspecies of the phylum ""Housewifius disgruntledus,"" kingdom ""Mammalia."" 
She has been observed spending long hours nestled on a pre-fab floral couch, downing glasses of red wine, curlers in her hair, watching soap operas on television without shame or irony. ""Not Hanz! Anyone but Hanz!"" She shouts at the screen -- an inanimate object -- revealing just how silly and hysterical she's become, or perhaps has always been. 
It's a trope we’ve grown comfortable with: older women who’ve put family and domestic duties before their careers are portrayed onscreen as lazy, petty and all-but-useless. Sure, there are the bossy, with-it exceptions that serve as foils to their lazy husbands, but these moms are often young, conventionally attractive, and actively involved with parenthood. Once the kids leave the nest, the housewife is left to wallow in soap opera-fueled sadness. 
If you saw “Joy,” the promising but ultimately cobbled-together film with a stellar performance by Jennifer Lawrence at its center, you’ve witnessed a recent iteration of the stereotype. While the titular Joy is a strong woman juggling familial problems with her creative pursuits, her mother is a shallow character who spends long days glued to a bed, broken by divorce and idealizing the unrealistic relationships shown on her favorite TV shows. She’s bug-eyed and mumbling, struggling to define herself after a thwarted attempt to fit the housewife mold. She’s couched as socially useless, a character we’re lead to laugh at rather than sympathize with.
It’s a decidedly Western stereotype, brought to life in Arundhati Roy’s book The God of Small Things, where the most deplorable character is an elderly woman who adores all things American, drawing tenuous connections between neighborhood gossip and comparable scenes from TV. Again, her character is out-of-touch and petty; as readers it’s difficult to find in her any redeemable qualities. 
This archetype serves as sharp opposition to how housewives were first characterized on TV: June Cleaver, of “Leave It to Beaver,” might’ve had banal interests, but her ability to instill a certain cookie-cutter morality into her boys’ lives was framed as noble. Regardless of your opinions on traditional ideas concerning the nuclear family, it’s inarguable that to some audience members, June represented a kind of impossible ideal. 
But, as a 2011 New York Times response to the “Real Housewives” phenomenon explores, the way we think about stay-at-home moms has gotten a facelift -- one that’s praised by some, and sneered about by others. 
The author, Carina Chocano, points out that a serious decline of conventional marriages -- that is, marriages that result in having kids -- means that becoming a housewife has, since the '70s, been a choice rather than an obligation to be fulfilled nobly, chin up. Moreover, a life of dish washing and care providing has since been positioned as counter to feminist ideals, a lazy option for lazy women, or at least women not prone to questioning the status quo. This is especially clear when watching the “The Real Housewives” series, where wealthy women with trivial concerns and listless days are mocked for their aimlessness. 
More recently, the binary of feminism versus housewife duties has been replaced with the concept of the do-it-all supermom, a woman expected to have the strength and time to nurture a career along with a gaggle of well-fed kids. This is where shows like “Jane the Virgin” get it right, featuring a flustered young woman zipping around Miami, missing grad school deadlines and small but important milestones in her infant son’s life. Jane’s attempt to do it all is so harrowing it lends the show the pace of a car chase, but it’s not a wholly critical look at the juggling act of career and motherhood -- she ends each day wiped and grateful. 
This has become the expected role for women, but more recently the concept that stay-at-home motherhood is a viable if not noble life path, one that’s hard to achieve alongside a full-time career. Although pursuing both is possible, the stigma around selecting one path or the other has lessened.
Some European countries have even begun legally recognizing the time-consuming work involved in raising children by suggesting universal incomes, rewarding all citizens, day-job holding and otherwise, an equal stipend. But pop culture seems not to have caught up with that notion, continuing to sketch housewives as goofy, lazy caricatures, less fully realized than their job-holding counterparts.
Attempts to add nuance to fictional housewives have been made in the years since “The Real Housewives” first aired, with mixed results. While “Desperate Housewives” was on its surface a satirical subversion of the old tropes, the characters reaffirmed them in many ways, serving as funny yet uncomplicated caricatures. And while Betty on “Mad Men” was granted episodes worthy of sympathy from the show’s writers, the audience discussed her, rather than the womanizing Don, as the show’s villain. 
More recently, nuance has been successfully added to the trope with the cliche-busting sitcom “Jane the Virgin,” which has already introduced us to type-A heroines and emotionally mature bad boys. The protagonist, Jane, is a hardworking romantic who balances motherhood with a job, grad school, and time with her doting mother and abuela, Alba Gloriana Villanueva. The three women live together, and are often shown swooning over soap opera together, including the cheesy, escapist show “The Passions of Santos.”
Although “Santos” is the butt of many jokes on “Jane the Virgin,” the women who watch it aren’t framed as silly. Rather, Alba and Jane are passionate perfectionists who take pleasure in watching ideal romantic scenarios play out. The show informs their romantic choices on occasion, but rarely outweighs their more practical values. 
In the world of “Jane,” dedication to family is considered on par with a successful career, and Jane herself is often seen speeding around town trying to invest equal time in each pursuit. The writers acknowledge that such a full plate is tiresome, but don’t give favor to one path or the other. While ambitious Raphael is flawed, his dedication to his work is admirable; while homebody, soap-loving Alba is sometimes a little whimsical, she’s also hard-nosed and opinionated. 
More than anything, lazing on the couch isn’t framed as a pursuit shared by unserious, aging mothers -- it’s instead a bonding activity that three very different women can share, much like the experience of curling up to watch the show itself.

He was 88.
He died in the late afternoon at his summer home in Montauk, a seaside fishing hamlet on the eastern tip of Long Island, after suffering a short illness to which he apparently succumbed, Albee’s assistant, Jakob Holder, told Reuters.
Holder said the playwright was not alone at the time of his death, but declined to furnish any further details.
Albee once told the Paris Review that he decided at age 6 that he was a writer but chose to work in the format of plays after concluding he was not a very good poet or novelist. His works would eventually rank him alongside Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller and Eugene O’Neill in American drama.
Albee described a playwright as “someone who lets his guts hang out on the stage,” and the innards of his own works included a powerful anger as he pushed themes such as alienation, resentment and the dark underside of life in the 1950s.
In the preface to his play “American Dream,” Albee described his approach as “an examination of the American Scene ... a condemnation of complacency, cruelty, emasculation, and vacuity ... a stand against the fiction that everything in this slipping land of ours is peachy-keen.”
The harsh humor and ferocity that prevailed in his more than 25 works long divided critics and audiences, earning Albee as much condemnation as praise. He always returned the volley of attacks, calling his critics fools and his Broadway audiences “placid cows.”
“Art should expand the boundaries of the form and, simultaneously, it should change our perceptions,” he told his biographer. “I despise restful art.”
SNUBBED, THEN ACCLAIMED BY PULITZERS
Albee made his name, and shocked audiences, when his scathing drama “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” opened on Broadway in 1962. Actors Arthur Hill and Uta Hagen starred as a married couple, George and Martha, who invite two friends over for an evening that deteriorates amid vitriol, drunkenness, profanity, emasculation, cruel mind games and physical abuse.
Albee said he took the name for his best-known work from a bit of graffiti scrawled in soap on the mirror of one of his favorite Greenwich Village bars.
The original production ran for 644 performances on Broadway. It went on to win a Tony Award for best play, spawned two successful Broadway revivals and was made into a popular movie in 1966 that featured Oscar-winning performances by Elizabeth Taylor, who starred opposite Richard Burton, and Sandy Dennis.
Although the stage version was selected by a Pulitzer Prize jury for the 1963 drama award, the Pulitzer advisory board overruled the jurors because of the play’s controversial nature.
No drama prize was given that year, but Albee went on to win three Pulitzers, in 1967 for “A Delicate Balance,” in 1975 for “Seascape,” and in 1991 for “Three Tall Women.”
Albee also won a 2002 Tony for “The Goat or Who Is Sylvia,” the story of an architect who falls in love with a goat, which marked Albee’s return to Broadway after almost 20 years. In 2005 he received a lifetime achievement Tony.
Albee was adopted shortly after birth by a wealthy New York family that sent him to elite schools - two of which expelled him - but he had no desire for social status. His rejection of the family values and preference for an artistic lifestyle led to the clashes with his strong-willed mother that he chronicled in “Three Tall Women,” his most autobiographical work.
Albee moved to New York’s Bohemian heart, Greenwich Village, at the age of 20 and worked a variety of jobs, including telegram messenger. He tried poetry and fiction before his first play, “The Zoo Story,” a one-act work about loneliness and class separation, was staged in 1959.
Other noted works included “Seascape,” which Albee directed when it opened on Broadway in 1974 and had an absurdist twist - an elderly couple are joined on the beach by two human-sized talking lizards as they consider their relationships.
“A Delicate Balance” also examined uneasy family dynamics. Albee wrote the script for the movie version of “A Delicate Balance,” which starred Katharine Hepburn, Lee Remick and Joseph Cotten.
Albee’s long-time partner, sculptor Jonathan Thomas, died in 2005 at age 59.

48,ARTS & CULTURE,A One-Woman Show Explores The Fragmented Life Of Frida Kahlo,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/frida-kahlo-play-andrea-dantas_us_58f0d253e4b0b9e9848b312f,"""Fragmented Frida"" creator Andrea Dantas was drawn to Kahlo's incredible resilience.",2017-04-14,ARTS & CULTURE,"A few years ago, Brazilian-born writer, actor and dancer Andrea Dantas heard back about her audition to dance flamenco on Madonna’s world tour. She didn’t get the job. 
“I thought, ‘OK, you’re allowed to feel sorry for yourself for 10 minutes,’” Dantas told The Huffington Post. “After, I thought, ‘What do you want to do now? What do you want to do with your life?’ And I swear, I heard a voice that said ‘Frida,’ and I just knew.”
The fruits of Dantas’ labor are currently on view at Brooklyn’s BAM Fisher, in a one-woman show called “Fragmented Frida.” Dantas plays the role of the iconic painter Frida Kahlo, starting as a young, awkward yet precocious child ― complete with a bowl cut and a limp ― and ending up as the most renowned woman artist of all time: braided hair, unibrow and all.
Far more than Dantas focuses on the specifics of Kahlo’s artistic craft, she zooms in on her life story, an extraordinary journey riddled with hardship. At the age of 6, Kahlo was stricken with polio, leaving her right leg incapacitated and in tremendous pain. At 18 she was involved in a near-fatal bus crash, which left her pelvis crushed. While recovering, and spending most of her time in a wheelchair, Kahlo began to paint, famously declaring: “I don’t paint dreams or nightmares, I paint my own reality.”
It was Kahlo’s incredible resilience that drew Dantas to her as a character. “At that time in Mexico, being a woman wasn’t cool, being a feminist wasn’t cool, divorcing a man wasn’t cool, being a bisexual wasn’t cool, being so free sexually was not cool at all,” Dantas said. “How did she manage to do so much in spite of all the illness and all the betrayals? How does the underdog become the hero?”
Dantas read around 20 Kahlo biographies before writing the script, taking about eight months to research. She then trained with movement coach Thiago Felix to accurately convey how Kahlo moved through the world, crippled at various points by illness, injury and heartbreak.
Even after receiving recognition for her dreamlike self-portraits, which translated her brutal physical and emotional wounds onto her painted flesh, Kahlo continued to suffer. After being told she could not conceive, she became pregnant, only to suffer a grisly miscarriage. She experienced infidelity on the part of her husband, painter Diego Rivera, most painfully with her own sister. 
While today Kahlo is regarded as a figure of strength and courage, it was important for Dantas to capture the softer, more vulnerable aspects of her personality to show how, despite the mythical status she achieved, she was an emotional, fallible human being.
“She had such a subtlety to her and a magnetism, she was a hopeless romantic,” Dantas said. “She was soft, she had a great sense of humor. It’s not just about the pain and the suffering. She was not a victim. This is a woman who, when her leg was amputated, the first thing she did was custom-make a boot for herself. She painted it red so everyone could see what was happening to her. She had an amazing zest for life.”
Although Dantas could not have predicted the political climate in which her play would debut, the current moment seems to make its message all the more pressing. “In the 1930s Frida said: ‘If the American people rebelled against everything that is wrong here, this would be a very different place,’” Dantas said. “Even then, she always said that women matter, that the LGBTQ community matters, that art matters. All the craziness that is happening in the country regarding immigration, she would have a lot to say about that for sure.” 
There have already been countless retrospectives, books, essays and films devoted to the life of Ms. Kahlo. Through “Fragmented Frida,” Dantas hopes to add her own perspective to the mix with a performance revolving around one particular thread of Kahlo’s many accomplishments: Her exceptional ability to turn vulnerability into strength.
“She overcame so much,” Dantas said. “She shows, with certainty, there is nothing a person cannot overcome.”
“Fragmented Frida,” directed by Christine Renee Miller, runs until Sunday, April 16, at BAM Fisher in Brooklyn, New York.

49,ARTS & CULTURE,Feminist Sci-Fi Writers Dream Up A Better Future For Women And Reproductive Health,Maddie Crum,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/feminist-sci-fi-writers-on-reproductive-health_us_58a7475de4b037d17d27983d,These authors – including Hugo and Philip K. Dick Award winners – imagine what's in store.,2017-03-06,ARTS & CULTURE,"According to the rhetoric used by Donald Trump during the presidential debates, women can “rip” babies out of their wombs moments before birth. This imagery runs counter to current laws, which in most states allow abortions only before a fetus has reached 24 to 26 weeks. Some states outlaw abortion as few as 12 weeks after a woman’s most recent menstrual period; North Dakota’s cutoff is six weeks.
The president’s language on the issue led pro-life proponents to fear an overturn of Roe v. Wade, a law that younger women may take for granted as a basic right. But stories like Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, a speculative fiction book from the 1980s that’s getting adapted this year for Hulu, work to remind us that few rights are truly inalienable, and a perfect storm of circumstances could undo the freedoms of millions.
While dystopian stories like Atwood’s help readers contextualize the here and now, there’s also a stable of science fiction authors using the genre to explore possible solutions to current problems. So, we asked authors to imagine how reproductive rights could be protected, and improved, in the future. Their answers, below, include birth control injections distributed to both men and women, and socializing kids to take ownership of their own bodies. 
Kameron Hurley, Hugo Award winner and author of The Geek Feminist Revolution
“’Women’s health’ is often used as a euphemism for ‘issues related to contraception and abortion.’ Certainly, there are many other health issues faced by cis and trans women alike, but it’s fertility that is often the most heavily legislated and taboo. How does technology solve a problem that is, at its core, a social problem? 
“Sure, the creation of artificial wombs sounds nice, but it does not remove the reproductive function of those who do have wombs, and it doesn’t erase the social stigma that many women endure. I’m often asked why I write all-women space operas like The Stars are Legion, or imagine fantastic societies with eight different genders and wild social taboos. I do this because many of our fundamental problems as human beings won’t be solved by creating a widget. There have been all sorts of useful widgets that failed because we could not make them socially palatable (Google Glass, anyone?). But what we need to change first is the stories of ourselves, and what it possible. 
“As we’ve seen over the last few months, who controls the narrative over a story has a huge impact on who creates the future. The future of women’s health does not require an artificial womb or a 100 percent effective contraceptive (though both would be nice). Instead, securing a future where cis and trans female bodies are afforded equal respect and research dollars requires a harnessing of the story of who matters. Create the story of who matters, and who is human, and the investment in the right widgets will follow.”
Meg Elison, Philip K. Dick Award winner and author of The Book of Etta
“The erosion of women’s rights to bodily autonomy begins early in life and must be approached at the root cause. We must uncouple the relationships between the body, sex, shame, and morality through compulsory education that rightly treats gender, sex, and sexuality as separate and independent subjects. We must reject all notions of the body as dirty or nudity as inherently sexual, desire as uncontrollable and unilateral or coercion as normal in intimate settings.
“This starts with granting children their own bodily autonomy; giving them the right to say no, to refuse kisses or cuddles, and never forcing them to show any kind of physical affection to anyone. This starts with toilet training kids without shame and using correct anatomical terms for their bodies. This starts with refraining from color-coding infants and projecting their entire futures and personalities based on their genitals. This starts with outlawing all circumcision, regardless of biological sex.
“None of this is unique to women or girls because women’s rights are human rights. We begin to lose them before we’re born, and the rest are given away or stolen later in life because we’ve been conditioned to believe they were never really ours to begin with. Stop that conditioning. Save girls and save the world.”
Elizabeth Bonesteel, author of the “Central Corps” series
“Throughout history, women’s health has been contentious for reasons entirely cultural. Humanity seems to have a deep, persistent discomfort with sexuality, and female sexuality in particular. While this is easing — slowly, and non-linearly — I expect we’re looking at more centuries than I like to think before we all grow up.
“As much as it seems reductive to say it, the issue revolves around women’s role in the human reproductive cycle. In order to depoliticize basic health issues, we need to get to a point where women have control over when (or if) they become pregnant, and how often. The simplest way to do this is through effective, easily-administered birth control. Despite the much-derided results of the trials of male chemical birth control, there’s no doubt we’re moving in a direction where there will be more options for everyone. As these methods become available, use will widen, and eventually they will have an effect similar to a vaccine, establishing a herd immunity against unplanned pregnancy. Eventually, accidental pregnancy will be seen as a medical failure, rather than some kind of cautionary tale — and at that point, perhaps the issue of bodily autonomy won’t be considered so controversial.”
Nalo Hopkinson, Hugo Award nominee and author of Falling in Love With Hominids 
[Hopkinson offered to provide an absurdist fictional scenario.]
“Science progresses swiftly to the point where transitioning from one gender to another is a complete change which happens at the chromosomal level. 45* comes out as female, becoming the U.S.’s first woman president. Health laws suddenly become more favorable towards women.”
“*I won’t call that man the president, so I’m using the term that’s becoming the accepted one for people who feel as I do.”
Amy S. Foster, author of “The Rift” trilogy
“What could the future hold for reproductive rights? They’ve already tried (and failed) to bring a birth control injection for men to market. Too many side effects ― though they were nominal and possibly caused by other drug interactions. I have to imagine that in the future we might see an improvement on bioidentical hormones, in general, so that women of all ages could not only control when they get pregnant but menopause could be experienced with no symptoms at all. Perhaps doctors could even find a way to keep eggs viable for longer so that women could have children at a much older age ― though in this scenario, aging itself might have to be dealt with!
“I think for me, as a mother of teenage girls, I would love to see a birth control injection that lasted for years and was mandatory throughout the world. It sounds completely totalitarian, I know, but I believe that no child, anywhere, should have to deal with the fear of parenthood, the emotional upheaval of abortion, or the trauma involved in adoption. I think allowing girls to grow up before becoming mothers would truly change the cultural, emotional and economic landscape of the entire planet for the better.”

51,ARTS & CULTURE,A Brief History Of America's Most Controversial Prefix,Katherine Brooks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/where-does-alt-come-from_us_582f3f8ce4b058ce7aaad274,"Dictionaries can tell you a lot about the thorny life of ""alt.""",2016-11-22,ARTS & CULTURE,"Alt-rock. Alt-lit. Alt-comedy. Alt-right.
What was once a prefix used to classify subgenres has become one of the more controversial modifiers of our day. “White supremacists have co-opted a combining form traditionally used for musical and literary genres,” Merriam-Webster wrote last week of “alt-right.” 
Short, of course, for “alternative” (an adjective meaning “different from the usual or conventional”), the prefix “alt” denotes something that rebels against tradition while belonging to it. For example, alt-country is a subdivision of country music; with a splash of punk it becomes a more precisely defined part of the country domain, bolded and underscored, but not removed from the whole. Similarly, alt-right as an ideological identifier ― popularized by Richard Bertrand Spencer, head of the white nationalist think tank National Policy Institute, in 2008 ― attempts to position its members within the right but as exceptional among its ranks.
Where does “alt” as we understand it come from? Merriam-Webster traced the popularity of “alt” back to the early days of the internet. “Alt” was the preferred prefix for a classification of Usenet newsgroups that “were created as an alternative forum to preexisting mainstream newsgroups,” Merriam-Webster recounts on its blog.
Popular in the 1980s and ‘90s, newsgroups were akin to online discussion groups and Usenet like a bulletin board system (BBS) that functioned as the precursor to internet forums. Essentially, computer users who frequented alt.* newsgroups were seeking an alternative to the mainstream discussions already happening on Usenet ― whether those discussions were about films, sports, politics, computers or sex. But “alternative” referred less to the content of the discussions, and more to the channels themselves.
As a FAQ (Copyright 1995 by David Barr and The Pennsylvania State University) notes:
 Contrary to popular belief, “alt” is not named because it is for “alternative” topics. Back during the dawn of the modern Usenet, it was decided that newsgroups should be created by following a clearly defined set of “Guidelines”, involving formal discussions and a voting procedure. There was a significant number of people who felt that there should be a provision for a place where people could create groups without having to go through any discussion or votes. Thus alt was born. It is a hierarchy that is “alternative” to the “mainstream” (comp,misc,news, rec,soc,sci,talk) hierarchy. “ALT stands for ‘Anarchists, Lunatics, and Terrorists’.” 
These “alt” groups valued highly the right to free speech while shunning hierarchy of any kind. (The apocryphal idea that “alt” stands for “anarchists, lunatics and terrorists” persists for a reason.) Some “alt” newsgroups were targeted by politicians for their associations with illegal entities, namely child pornographers. But others were simply places for little-known recommendations: alt.movies.silent, alt.movies.hitchcock, alt.movies.kubrick, etc.
All in all, “these newsgroups [...] left alt- with a connotation of edginess,” Merriam-Webster argues. This edginess, the dictionary clarifies, “with its vague historical echoes of online culture,” was part of the appeal for the alt-right founders. “[It] seems to be what racist proponents of the alt-right had in mind when they rebranded old-school white supremacy under the alt- banner,” the blog post continues. And then there’s the useful sense of belonging.
“Generally speaking, identity labels are intended to open up space for belonging,” Merriam-Webster lexicographer Kory Stamper told The Huffington Post. “What’s interesting about ‘alt-’ is that while it’s clearly a rebellion against an established identity — rock, right, press — it’s also defining itself with respect to that identity. That means that the core identity becomes an on-ramp for people into the ‘alt-’ identity.”
The Oxford Dictionaries shortlisted “alt-right” for its word of the year, defining the term as “an ideological grouping associated with extreme conservative or reactionary viewpoints, characterized by a rejection of mainstream politics and by the use of online media to disseminate deliberately controversial content.” According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the alt-right constitutes a “set of far-right ideologies, groups and individuals whose core belief is that ‘white identity’ is under attack by multicultural forces.” (Alt-right views, NPR reports, are widely perceived as anti-Semitic and white supremacist.)
The alt-right, in these terms, might seem disconnected from the benign punk attitudes of alt-music and alt-literature, but perhaps it’s not that far removed from the alt.* hierarchy mentality. Some words of wisdom from Barr’s FAQ ring as eerily familiar today: 
 There are no Guidelines or Rules for creating alt groups. There is no one “in charge” of the alt hierarchy. The key to creating a successful alt newsgroup depends only on convincing the thousands of news administrators across the globe to carry your newsgroup. 
When asked whether or not another combining form would have communicated as specific of an idea as the alt-right sought to convey, Stamper was hesitant. “Alt-” itself, Stamper said, is becoming so familiar ― “particularly in music, where ‘alt-rock’ has now become part of the ‘establishment’” ― that compound prefixes like “alt-alt-” and “alt-alt-alt-” are popping up in Merriam-Webster’s archives, so there’s some value in its soft recognition.
“I haven’t run across any other compelling prefixes that convey both a sense of belonging and rebellion,” she replied. “I suppose ‘un-’ might qualify, though I think that ad campaigns for 7Up as the ‘un-cola’ might have commercialized the connotation too much. ‘Un-’ also defines a movement by what it’s not, which might be so broad in the case of something like ‘the un-left’ or ‘the un-right’ that just about anyone could belong to either.”
For those alt-classical enthusiasts upset that their prefix has ended up in the hands of white nationalists, perhaps the “un-right” communicates more clearly the absurdity of Richard Spencer’s ilk. Or, as several writers and editors have expressed, when in doubt, save “alt” for another moment of modification and just stick with a more precise descriptor: “white supremacist.”

When he was captured by the Fascist militia in December of 1943, Primo Levi (1919-1987) preferred to declare his status as an “Italian citizen of the Jewish race” than admit to the political activities of which he was suspected, which he supposed would have resulted in torture and certain death. 
As a Jew, he was consequently sent to a detention camp at Fossoli, which assembled all the various categories of persons no longer welcome in the recently established Fascist Republic. Two months later, following the inspection of a small squad of German SS men, he was loaded onto a train, together with all the other Jewish members of the camp, for expatriation from the Republic altogether. 
His destination, he was to learn, was Auschwitz; a name that at the time held no significance for him, but that initially provided a sense of relief, since it at least implied “some place on this earth”. 
Of the 650 who departed Fossoli that day, only three would return. Yet Levi’s magnificent testimony of the Lager, Se questo è un uomo (If This is a Man) – which he would compose in the immediate aftermath of the resumption of his life in Turin, and which was first published 70 years ago in 1947, making it one of the earliest eyewitness accounts we have – is far from a heroic description of his “survival in Auschwitz” (as the American title given to his text would have it). Although in an important sense it is also that. 
Indeed, what is striking about Levi’s contribution, still today, is the conspicuous absence of a heroic register from its pages, whose appropriateness in this context – which is in large part what Levi teaches us – must surely be as questionable as the temptation to invoke it is strong. 
With characteristic, but unsettling irony, it is the word fortune that appears instead in the very first sentence of his text (“It was my good fortune to be deported to Auschwitz only in 1944…”) and that sets the tone for all that follows. In the camp, it is not virtue that governs fortune; it is fortune that governs virtue.

It is the original title of Levi’s book that in truth gives expression to what will be his principal concern. Yet this is easily misunderstood. It is not exactly a question, and certainly not one that solicits an answer. But it is not even a question whose answer would be provided by the text itself, which claims no such privilege. 
As we learn from the poem that opens the text, it must be understood instead to contain an implicit imperative: “Consider if this is man…” It is an order, a command (“I command these words to you”); one that is linked, moreover, to an imprecation: 

Carve them in your hearts 
… Repeat them to your children, 
Or may your house fall apart, 
May illness impede you, 
May your children turn their faces from you. 
It is thus an admonition that we (“You who live safe/In your warm houses”) not avert our gaze. But since Levi, remarkably, includes even himself in this category, it functions also as a kind of self-admonition.
For the description of what Levi calls the “ambiguous life of the Lager” alters our understanding of the very structure of witnessing. And it does so by bringing to light the existence of a distinct oppositional pair much less evident in ordinary life: the drowned (i sommersi) and the saved (i salvati). 
In Auschwitz, all the ritual humiliations appeared as if designed to hasten the prisoner’s descent to what Levi termed “the bottom”. But this process was especially accelerated in the case of those he called the drowned: “they followed the slope down to the bottom, like streams that run down to the sea”. 
These were the prisoners who, for whatever reason (and the reasons were many), never adjusted to the brutal regimen of life in the camp; whose time in the camp was thus consequently very brief; yet whose number was apparently endless. 
In the jargon of the camp, these were the Muselmänner, the “Muslims”, whose tenuous existence, even prior to their imminent selection for the gas chamber, already hovered in an indistinct zone between life and death, human and non-human. These, according to Levi, were the ones who had truly seen all the way to the bottom: the ones who (as he would later powerfully record) had truly seen the Gorgon.
With respect to the “anonymous mass” of the drowned, the number of the saved, on the other hand, was comparatively few. Yet by no means did it consist of the best, and certainly not of the elect. To invoke the guiding hand of providence in the midst of such atrocity was nothing short of abhorrent to Levi.

He is unflinching on precisely this delicate point: with rare exceptions, the saved comprised those who, in one way or another, whether through fortune or astuteness, had managed to gain some position of privilege in the structured hierarchy of the camp. 
More often than not, this entailed the renunciation of at least a part of the moral universe that existed outside the camp. Not that the saved, any more than the drowned, are to be judged on this account. As Levi insists, words such as good and evil, just and unjust, quickly cease to have any meaning on this side of the barbed wire. 
It was nonetheless his conviction that those who had not fathomed all the way to the bottom could not be the true witnesses. Yet far from invalidating the survivor’s testimony this made it all the more urgent. 
According to Levi, it is the saved who must bear witness for the drowned, but also to the drowned. For in him is mirrored what he himself saw. 
“Consider if this is a man…”: the imperative issued by Levi’s text is thus not that one should persist in seeing the human in the inhuman. It is more like its opposite: that one bear must witness to the inhuman in the human. And that our humanity in some sense depends on this.

It’s safe to say “become ceramicist” is out of the question, at least according to this throwback commercial for an internet company called Cozone. 
Politico uploaded the old gem to Facebook last week, which features Trump’s clumsy attempt at mastering the potter’s wheel. It seems, however, that the Republican nominee lacks the patience and tenderness needed to truly work the clay into anything beyond a turd-shaped mess. He ends up bribing a fellow potter for his piece instead. 
The short clip concludes with Trump leering at a female ceramicist’s cleavage while washing up, which feels all too real in light of recent sexual assault allegations against him. So funny how bad he is at ceramics and how good he is at being a sexual predator! Really guys, good one.

55,ARTS & CULTURE,The Lavish Legacy Of Oscar De La Renta Lives On,Tricia Tongco,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-lavish-legacy-of-oscar-de-la-renta-lives-on_us_56fc70bbe4b0a06d5804bc2d,“I believe that my sole purpose as a designer is to create something that I think a woman would want to wear.”,2016-04-01,ARTS & CULTURE,"“The 21st century is the century of the woman,” said Oscar de la Renta in 2010. 
You can see this declaration manifested throughout his work, and throughout his current retrospective at the de Young Museum in San Francisco. His designs, known for their boldness, femininity and opulence, require a woman to be comfortable taking center stage, whether it’s in a full floral ballgown, vibrant kaftan or an embellished tunic.
It’s no surprise then that powerful women from the realms of both politics and pop culture have continuously been loyal clients of the designer throughout his career, from presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to pop star Taylor Swift. At the end of the day, women -- and how they felt in his clothes -- were always what drove his vision.
“I believe that my sole purpose as a designer is to create something that I think a woman would want to wear,” said de la Renta in 1972.
Although there are more than 120 ensembles produced over five decades on display, every piece seems to make one unifying assertion: “Look at me.” His work embraces a singular expression of womanhood, reveling in its aspects of adornment, attention and drama. If all the world’s a stage, de la Renta’s clothes are what you’d want to be wearing for your moment in the spotlight. 
While the retrospective highlights his global influences, from East to West, it also conveys his overarching American attitude toward change. The Dominican Republic-born designer refined his craft in Paris but left for this reason: “I’d come to New York because I believed the future of fashion was in ready-to-wear.”
“Over the course of his career, he mixed an incredible sensibility of ready-to-wear and haute couture, creating demi couture, an amazing synthesis of both,” Richard Benefield, the de Young’s Acting Director and Exhibition Organizer, explained to The Huffington Post. “Oscar could do it all -- whatever was the most fashionable at the moment, he’d do it with his distinctive flair and eye for aesthetics.”
Like a story out of a fashion fairy tale, on his very first night in Manhattan, de la Renta met cosmetics mogul Elizabeth Arden, who offered him a job the following morning designing haute couture gowns for her design house. Two years later, he started his own collection bearing his name.
His legendary status doesn’t end there -- in fact, it was just building. In 1973, he represented the United States as one of five designers at the notorious “Battle of Versailles” fashion show, a competition between French and American designers. De la Renta and the other Americans were a sensation, challenging old-world European haute couture with their ready-to-wear designs.
With a career-long retrospective, it’s easy to see that the 1980s were the designer’s spiritual and aesthetic home. His bold clothes during that time reflected American might and confidence. “In the eighties, it was back into rich, opulent clothes, which were my thing,” he's said.
After the 1980s, the designer was always forward-thinking though, especially when it came to looking to diverse cultures for inspiration, including Chinese embroideries, Indian textiles, Uzbek and Kazakh ikat-patterned cloths, Japanese woodblock prints,and traditional Russian fabrics and ornamentation.
“Today, people -- clothes -- are international. Frontiers are non-existent,” de la Renta says.
His sentiments, like his clothes, feel eternally modern yet timeless. “Oscar de la Renta: The Retrospective” presents the life and legacy of a man who loved life and encourages you to celebrate it, too. With the show’s lush exuberance, it’s an invitation that's hard to resist.
“Oscar de la Renta: The Retrospective,” curated by André Leon Talley, is on view until May 30, 2016 at the de Young in San Francisco, Calif.

It wasn’t his girlfriend’s first time at a Planned Parenthood; she’d had a colposcopy done there before, and was mistakenly confronted by protesters who thought she was there for an abortion.
“She was so stressed out about going there [again],” Bailey told The Huffington Post. “Not only because she thought she might have cancer, but because she was worried that the protesters would be there.” 
So Bailey, a street photographer, tagged along, and snapped photos of the protesters, many of whom he had conversations with unrelated to his own political beliefs.
“At first, most of them were OK with it,” Bailey said. “They just asked that I didn't blind them with the flash. They even offered to take me to lunch. And they would ask me if I was pro-choice, but I never wanted to talk about that. I always danced around the issue, and I never tried to argue with them or anything like that.”
But, once Bailey’s opinions came to light, the protesters asked him -- with increasing hostility -- to stop photographing them. He says some of them claimed he needed a model release form, which isn’t the case. Street photographers have the legal right to capture individuals in public places, even if the ethics of doing so are hazy.
Portraying subjects negatively without their consent isn’t illegal, but for some street photographers it raises questions. Expressing a popular approach, street photographer Ron Haviv said in an interview with Feature Shoot, “In many cases, if I point a camera toward someone, and there is no negative reaction, I feel fine in taking the image. If they say no, verbally or otherwise, I respect their choice.”
Bailey feels similarly, and stressed that many of the protesters acted kindly toward him, in spite of having differing beliefs. But, he said, “If you don't want to be photographed, if you don't want to attract my attention as a photographer, don't stand out here on a busy street holding a controversial sign.”
Many of his photos spotlight said controversial signs, including one that reads, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you -- God.” Each is shot using a bright flash that lights the subjects from below, creating an ethereal glow or, sometimes, a horror movie effect.
Several subjects are captured with their palms blocking the camera, demonstrating their desire not to be photographed, and creating an air of intrusion. 
“I hope the mood is austere and a little frightening,” Bailey said. “I think one of the central themes is invasion of privacy. I was photographing people who did not want to be photographed, even though they were protesting in a public space. But I trespassed on their personal space and took the photos anyhow. I think it sends a message that they're doing the same thing. They're invading people's right to medical privacy, as well.”

Just last week, The Huffington Post reported that President Donald Trump’s administration might shut down the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. That means funding for national arts and humanities could decline, or worse yet, all but disappear.
Brady, who currently portrays Aaron Burr in the musical, says with Trump in the White House, it’s more important than ever to support arts programming and initiatives, in addition to plenty of other important causes and rights that could be at risk.
“It’s happened and it’s happening,” Brady told The Huffington Post. “And it’s going to happen for four more years. And the reality of it is no matter where you fall — if you are pro-Trump or anti-Trump, he is the president. And what are we gonna do?”
“I think we need pieces of art like this to keep that fire burning so you just don’t fall into a slope, like, ‘Whatever, it’s four years,’” he continued. “No, during these four years, what are you going to fight for? Fight for the arts. Fight for LGBT rights. Fight for the rights of every minority who gets kicked in the ass with every one of Trump’s cabinet members being placed [in office].”
Brady is no stranger to theater, having previously starred on Broadway in “Chicago” and “Kinky Boots.” So, it’s not surprising that the all-around entertainer would make a plea like this.
“Go out, support the arts, [support] the things that he [Trump] is killing … By doing ‘Hamilton’ not only am I supporting arts, but I’m in art,” he said. “I’m a trumpeter for the rights of all of us, especially being a black man in this country.” 
Of course, one could argue that “Hamilton” ― with its diverse cast and its historical storyline ― resonates even more now with what’s happening in current national politics. But Brady says his interest in “Hamilton” first piqued in 2015 when Lin-Manuel Miranda launched the now Tony Award-winning musical.
“Ever since this began ― pre–Donald Trump circus ― it’s resonated with what it means to be an American … Like the line, ‘Immigrants, we get the job done.’ My folks are from the Virgin Islands,” Brady said, “just like [Alexander] Hamilton. It’s inspirational to know that this little chain of islands can produce such greatness.” 
Brady stars in “Hamilton” at Chicago’s PrivateBank Theatre through April 9.

NEWARK, N.J., May 5 (Reuters) - Hip hop artist Lauryn Hill, on the eve of her scheduled sentencing on federal tax evasion charges, has paid off the balance of more than $900,000 she owed in back taxes and penalties, her attorney said on Sunday.
The Grammy-winning musician is scheduled for sentencing on Monday in U.S. District Court in Newark, New Jersey on three charges she failed to file tax returns on more than $1.8 million between 2005 and 2007.
She faces up to a year in jail for each charge, but the final sentence is expected to be adjusted based on her repayment of the money, her attorney said.
She owed at least $504,000 in federal back taxes as well as state taxes and penalties that brought the estimated total to more than $900,000.
""Ms Hill has not only now fully paid prior to sentencing her taxes, which are part of her criminal restitution, but she has additionally fully paid her federal and state personal taxes for the entire period under examination through 2009,"" her attorney, Nathan Hochman, said in an email.
In April, Hill was admonished by U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo for failing to make promised payments on her unpaid taxes ahead of her sentencing.
She had expected to raise the money from a new recording contract last fall but only paid $50,000 when she did not complete the expected tracks, her attorney said.
Her attorney said last month that Hill lined up a loan secured by two pieces of real estate. He said on Sunday that the tax repayment came from a combination of sources but did not include funds from any new record sales.
A new single by Hill, her first in several years, called ""Neurotic Society,"" was posted on iTunes on Friday.
She posted a link to the song on the social media site Tumblr on Saturday, writing, ""Here is a link to a piece that I was 'required' to release immediately, by virtue of the impending legal deadline.
""I love being able to reach people directly, but in an ideal scenario, I would not have to rush the release of new music... But the message is still there,"" she wrote.
Hill's 1998 solo album ""The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill"" won the singer, a former member of the Fugees, five Grammy awards.
Hill is from South Orange, New Jersey.

The “No Scrubs” singer faced a hailstorm of criticism on social media this week following the airing of an interview with London’s Channel 4 News on Wednesday. During the segment, Chilli was asked her thoughts on Black Lives Matter.
“I personally didn’t go into any marches, or anything like that, but for me, all lives matter, you know what I mean?” she said. “Because there is a time when different groups are targeted for different things, you know what I’m saying?”
“I just think that, just the whole … what happened, police brutality, against these young black boys, all of that kind of stuff is wrong, even if it was a Caucasian teen kid that this was happening to or whatever. It’s just not right,” she added.
The comments left some fans disappointed in the 46-year-old singer, who is known for empowering hits like “Unpretty” and “Waterfalls.”
Chilli released a statement Thursday to celebrity gossip site The Shade Room to clarify her comments:
 “Of course Black Lives Matter and the killing of young black boys is heartbreaking to all of us. Everyone knows I am a black mother of a black son so there is no way I could watch what’s happening and not be affected. That video was from an interview in London asking me about issues happening in the U.S. My response was inclusive of everyone, but not meant to undervalue the Black Lives Matter movement or to suggest police brutality against blacks is acceptable.” 
TLC’s London interview was in promotion of the group’s fifth and final album, which is scheduled to hit stores and digital retailers on June 30.

Jurnee Smollett-Bell's role as Rosalee, one of the house slaves plotting to escape, was especially grueling for the actress to film. 
While the subject matter itself was tough, Smollett-Bell said the physical aspects were just as difficult. She found herself sprinting across fields and wading through the bayou, all under the scorching hot Baton Rouge sun. 
""You have to do it take, after take, after take, and you're in these corsets and your dress is like four or five layers and it's 106 degrees in Baton Rouge in the dead of summer,"" she said. ""We were swimming in swamps and trying to do as many stunts of our own as we could."" 
Smollett-Bell said she trained for the physically challenging role, but still struggled to keep up with the fast-moving cameras.
""They would strap a camera on the back of this gator, which was a like a really rugged golf cart and you would have to chase the camera. And Anthony [Hemingway], our director, would shout, 'Keep up!' And it's like, this gator, while it's not a car, it can go much faster than I can!"" she told host Alex Miranda.
Overall, the experience was incredibly humbling for the actress, who would often think back to the brave men and women who lived through such grisly conditions years before. 
 These were real people, who actually survived and were experiencing these conditions in real life. They would [yell,] ""cut"" and I could have a glass of water or sit in the shade and the level of danger was non-existent for me. And so it was always humbling going home at night when I can climb into my comfortable bed and you just think about the Rosalees of the world who couldn't, who actually lived this. So, I couldn't complain. 
While the show portrayed the difficult conditions of life as a slave, it also aimed to show the humanity of the characters, who pulled through by singing hymns and building a community. 
""They did laugh, they did fall in love. And while they were under incredibly oppressive conditions, they constantly were trying to steal pleasures,"" she said. ""When you go back to the slave narratives and you read books like the Bullwhip Days or Incidents in the Life of the Slave Girl, they will share what life was like and it's a 365-degree view. It's not just the oppression. It's not just the victimization.""

72,BLACK VOICES,Resolution on Dalits Commendable But Outdated,"Murali Balaji, ContributorDirector of Education and Curriculum Reform, Hindu American Fo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/resolution-on-dalits-comm_b_5288617.html,"For many years, the complex social practice of caste in the Indian subcontinent (and to a lesser degree, the South Asian Diaspora) has been the subject of activism and reform efforts.",2014-05-08,VOICES,"For many years, the complex social practice of caste in the Indian subcontinent (and to a lesser degree, the South Asian Diaspora) has been the subject of activism and reform efforts.  Since the 19th century implementation of the census by the British in what is now modern-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal (and other countries such as Sri Lanka and Bhutan), the notion of caste has been one of the most widely misunderstood and misinterpreted concepts within the subcontinent and in the West. Especially problematic was the notion of untouchability and the role of those called Dalits, Harijans or Scheduled Castes.  Last Friday, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) introduced a resolution ""Condemning Dalit untouchability"" and ""the practice of birth-descent discrimination against Dalit people."" The resolution is a follow up to her involvement several months ago with a Dalit empathy event co-organized by the Dalit Freedom Network, an Evangelical organization that has worked closely with the controversial Joshua Project -- an initiative to try to convert non-Christians throughout the world. 
While Holmes Norton's efforts to highlight caste-based oppression are admirable, the resolution is couched in outdated views of how most South Asians living in that part of the world conceptualize caste. In fact, historians such as Valerie Hansen and Kenneth Curtis suggest that ""most outside observers tend to exaggerate the rigidity of caste in modern India"" and other parts of the subcontinent. In fact, many Indians -- impacted by rapid urbanization and migration away from rural areas -- don't view caste as an essential part of their identity or a basis for social interaction.
The Dalit Freedom Network has tried to win over African-American lawmakers by comparing the condition of Dalits in countries such as India and Nepal with the oppression faced by Black South Africans during apartheid, which parallels comments made several years ago by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Those comparisons, however sincere, are simply not accurate.  As the Hindu American Foundation noted several years ago in its exhaustive study, caste divisions in the Indian subcontinent have absolutely nothing to do with skin color, a specific religion, or even economic status. Many of our contemporary understandings of the caste system in the Indian subcontinent were derived from colonial era interpretations. Unfortunately, ""caste-ism"" is practiced by people of all faiths in the Indian subcontinent, despite both governmental bans on the practice and religious doctrines forbidding such discrimination. And while caste discrimination is abhorrent, scheduled castes have had equal votes and quotas for education and economic opportunities since independence of South Asian nations from British rule.  Holmes Norton's resolution, while paying homage to Indian freedom fighter and caste activist B.D. Ambedkar, misunderstands his legacy. In fact, in correspondences with W.E.B. Du Bois, Ambedkar -- who vigorously criticized Hinduism, Islam and Christianity for what he perceived to be their sanctioning of inequality -- lamented a lack of opportunity for Untouchables. Interestingly enough, Ambedkar was also one of the most vocal opponents of the now debunked Aryan Invasion Theory, which was advanced by Orientalists to explain the development of ancient Indian civilization.
To be sure, Holmes Norton has embarked on a well-meaning attempt to highlight social injustices in other parts of the world. But comparing caste discrimination to Apartheid or Jim Crow both oversimplifies a long social history in the subcontinent and obscures the actual suffering of Black South Africans during the brutal years of white rule (or violent and systemic oppression of African Americans prior to the Civil Rights Act). Perhaps Holmes Norton can use the resolution to learn -- as well as educate others -- about the complexity of caste and other forms of social division across the world, just as pioneers such as Du Bois did in their interactions with Ambedkar.

Created by publicist Lauran Smith, she said Chicago Black Restaurant Week is a nod to black history and it's a way to celebrate and economically empower the black-owned eateries in the city that are usually not included in restaurant week.
""I chose the week because before there was Black History Month, way back in 1926, Dr. Carter G. Woodson created Negro History Week, which was always the second week in February,"" Smith told WBEZ. ""So I said let me honor his initial vision to honor African-Americans who have played a part in our history. And let me do the restaurant week so it can commemorate what he did and so we can start something new in 2016.""
From Feb. 7 to Feb. 13, more than a dozen restaurants and bakeries are participating in Black Restaurant Week, offering discounts on their best dishes. Foodies can enjoy cuisine from Caribbean spots, Italian bistros, soul food joints and neighborhood grills. 
With more than 120 black-owned eateries in Chicago, Smith said she intends to expand Black Restaurant Week each year and encourage more people to support these black-owned businesses.

For some black activists who have long been mobilizing around gun violence, the current wave of public attention and outrage over the issue is welcome. But it also invites the question of why there’s been comparatively little attention and outrage focused on the even more common reality of routine gun homicides in the country, which disproportionately affect communities of color, and specifically black Americans. 
Prominent black organizers and public figures have also noted the largely positive public response to the student activists from Parkland ― most of whom are not black and who attended school in a largely white, relatively affluent Florida suburb ― compared to the frequent vilification of young black activists protesting gun violence, particularly police shootings. 
“It’s complicated, but I would encourage us to lean into the complicated,” Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors said on a panel with HuffPost Editor-in-Chief Lydia Polgreen on Wednesday. “Why don’t black people get to be victims? That’s the question we have to ask ourselves ... It’s a question not just for elected officials but it’s a question for us ... Who gets to be a victim?”
“I’m so grateful these children are getting the support they need,” she added. “And where is our support?”
In the wake of the Florida shooting, students from Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have led a bold wave of mobilizations ― organizing school walkouts, speaking at rallies and planning the nationwide March for Our Lives protest next month. The teens have been justifiably celebrated on social media, featured in the news (including at HuffPost), and some were even invited to the White House.
HuffPost reached out to March for Our Lives, but did not immediately receive a response.
Importantly, those bringing up this disparity are not criticizing the Parkland students’ activism ― quite the opposite. The only people seeking to discredit the teens so far seem to be right-wing conspiracy theorists claiming the teens are “crisis actors.” 
Still, the different public responses are telling: There’s justified, universal outrage at a shooting in a largely white, affluent area, but not so much at the frequent shooting deaths of black Americans; the public is praising Parkland’s student activists, but not so much Black Lives Matter organizers.
“I’m excited these young people are getting attention, which they deserve, and they’re driving amazing social change,” Dante Barry, co-founder of anti-racist, anti-violence organization Million Hoodies, told HuffPost on Thursday. “But I’m also disheartened and a little shocked to see folks like Oprah give $500,000 to [March for Our Lives], while she’s seen black folks in the streets for years.”
“The way people are responding to predominantly white communities is notable: Whose movement is more valuable to support?” he added. “Other communities that have been devastated by gun violence are still fighting for crumbs.”
Young black activists who have been mobilizing around gun violence, including police shootings, for several years are generally perceived negatively by white Americans, are often arrested for protesting, and have been labeled as “extremists” by the FBI.
When black activists have taken to the streets to protest police shootings, members of law enforcement have met them in full riot gear, and at times attacked them with tear gas. By contrast, the largely non-black student activists from Parkland have been invited to a CNN town hall event with lawmakers.
“What happens is white people get to be everything ― they get to be victims, they get to be heroes,” Cullors said on the Wednesday panel. “Black people unfortunately continue to be criminalized for our moments of courage, mourning or grieving. When we go out to the streets to protest for our lives that matter, we’re given heavy police repression. This is a race question.”
Mass shootings like the one in Florida often spur an important national conversation on gun control, particularly when shooters target schools, like at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, or when there are high death counts, like in Las Vegas last year. 
Yet while mass shootings have been on the rise in recent years, they represent just a portion of overall gun deaths in the U.S. annually.
In total, there were around 12,500 to 15,500 gun deaths per year in the U.S. from 2014 to 2017, not including suicides, according to the Gun Violence Archive. According to data collected by Everytown for Gun Safety, an average of just over 100 people died each year in mass shootings from 2009 to 2016 ― with mass shootings defined as incidents in which four or more people were shot and killed, not including the shooter.
The steady drumbeat of gun homicides that take place across the country every day disproportionately affect communities of color ― especially black people, who make up around 14 percent of the U.S. population but account for more than half the country’s gun homicide victims. There were also close to 2,000 police shootings annually in the past few years ― and black people are far more likely than their white peers to be killed in encounters with police.
“I’m very impressed and inspired by what I’m seeing these students do. Fighting for gun control ― I take my hat off to them,” Cobe Williams, deputy director at Chicago-based gun violence prevention organization Cure Violence told HuffPost on Wednesday.
 “I like what they’re doing, and we’re doing this on an everyday basis,” he said. “I applaud them, but we see this violence on an everyday basis. It could be one person or 24 people ― one person shot and killed is too many.”

Greg Gianforte has won the Congressional seat in Montana once held by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, even after violently man-handling a reporter for no good reason. Bullying and being an a-hole wins again. Do what you want - slap babies, push old ladies down, spit on the poor. Trump’s Conservatism means as long as you friggin promise to bring coal jobs back, anything goes.
The temperamental millionaire took the race by 7 points. Based on Trump’s current approval ratings, and the percentage by which he won the state, that could be considered a close race, but after Gianforte’s violent display yesterday, I think we’d all hoped that we had a chance to send a message to the Trump wing of the Republican party. Instead Montana’s vote has probably only bolstered the bravado of the white men in positions of power who relish the chance to use strong-arm tactics against the media and anyone else who stands in the way of tax breaks for the rich and upending Obama’s legacy healthcare legislation.
I don’t know about you, but I simply don’t buy the whole “3/4 of the votes were already cast” explanation for this outcome. Montana had to know this guy was a hot-head with a campaign full of liars even BEFORE it was all caught on audio, and polls showed that the race was supposed to be close. What’s clear is that thanks to Trump’s shenanigans on the campaign trail during the 2016 election, we have turned a dangerous corner in our political discourse, one where you can commit acts of violence when you don’t get your way. If we don’t do something and do it quick, we won’t find our way back, and the a-holes will rule for the next 8 years.
That’s right, 8 years - with all the love Trump and his band of Putin-planted cronies have given Russia, I’m guessing the propaganda machine will be in over-drive in 2020, and the same people that fell for Trump and the Republican’s empty promises will sign up for it all again. No more intellect or civility in the White House as long as we can be duped by fake news and divided.
Based on what I see coming through my Facebook feed everyday, my African-American brothers and sisters seem especially susceptible to lies propagated through fake news, as long as it’s punctuated with “stay woke”. Well, sorry to say, but I don’t need for y’all to #staywoke. I need for y’all to educate yourselves, learn the difference in what’s real and what’s not. Trump and his entire administration playing SOME form of footsie with Russia? Real. The middle class dying because of 8 years of Obama-blocking? Real. But we do ourselves a disservice if we believe everything that comes across Facebook. New-age internet propagandists were able to divide us with precision during the 2016 election, with tales of Hillary and sex-trafficking, and only god knows what else. We believe what we want to believe, and someone - Russia, Republicans, random hackers, probably all three - has learned how to use it against us.
So stay woke, sure. But while you’re rubbing the sleep out of your eyes, learn the truth and reject the lies and propaganda that threaten to keep us divided and ignorant from now on. And most of all, don’t be afraid to engage with others - yes even Trump supporters - to try to educate them and find common ground. If we don’t, civility is gone forever, internet hackers will continue to lead us around by the nose, and the assholes win.

That was appalling.""",2015-11-18,VOICES,"From Ava DuVernay to Salma Hayek to Michelle Yeoh, there's no shortage of talented women of color in Hollywood -- which is why the latest cover of The Hollywood Reporter is sticking out like a sore thumb. 
The lack of diversity was so obvious, the magazine couldn't help but address it with an essay titled ""Why Every Actress on The Hollywood Reporter Roundtable Cover Is White."" 
Each year the magazine picks actresses from the big and small screen who are likely to be contenders for shiny statues come awards season. 
While praising the eight critically-acclaimed women chosen for this year's roundtable, THR Executive Editor Stephen Galloway noted that ""even for me, a white man, it was impossible to ignore the fact that every one of these women was white""
""That was appalling,"" Galloway said, before laying out ""the awful truth"":
""[T]here are no minority actresses in genuine contention for an Oscar this year."" 
Galloway owned up a little bit to being part of the problem, voicing his regret for passing over ""Straight Outta Compton"" director F. Gary Gray for the THR directors roundtable, but laid most of the blame on the industry at large. 
""The Academy drew flak for failing to nominate Selma in many categories; but the Academy doesn’t make films, any more than The Hollywood Reporter does; it recognizes work that the industry creates.""
Galloway later spoke with The Huffington Post by phone and said he was surprised by the buzz around his essay, and that he was compelled to write it because he feels passionately about the issue of diversity and representation in Hollywood. 
""The problem is not just who is being cast, it’s what movies are being made,"" Galloway told HuffPost. ""If I knew the column would have gotten this response, I would have added the statistics: I would have gone to each studio and said ‘How many people of color are in your executive suites? How many people are on your development team?'""
Academy Award nominee and Emmy winner Viola Davis addressed the issue in her acceptance speech in September when she said, ""The only thing that separates women of color from anyone else is opportunity. You can not win an Emmy for roles that simply are not there.""
Janice Min, Chief Creative Officer for THR's parent group tried calling attention to previous covers that were slightly more representative (at least of black actors, though they drew more than once from the Viola Davis-Octavia Spencer well).
After last year's very white Oscars were the least diverse since 1998, this year's batch of contenders isn't shaping up to be much more representative.
When it comes to celebrating the wide range of diversity and talent in film, Hollywood still has a long way to go.

Zion, Black Church, Fights To Sustain Traditions As Connection To History",Patrice Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rossville-zion-black-church-traditions_us_5badc04ce4b0bb1705fab22d,"“Religious institutions are the crossroads of a community,” he said, likening the role of Rossville in Sandy Ground to the",2012-08-26,VOICES,"Deaconess Mary Cooper sat in an empty, front row pew at the Rossville A.M.E. Zion church reflecting on the summer roasts held in the congregation’s bucolic backyard pit in Sandy Ground, Staten Island.
“You didn’t get no barbecue from Mr. Skin Tom unless it was done,” said the 83-year-old Cooper with a slow smile spreading across her delicate face.
“I ate ribs, I ate chicken, and I ate the pork. All of it.” 
The church’s annual barbecues were more than a summer tradition; they were a rite of passage, both for the congregants and non-churchgoing residents alike. 
But things are slowly changing in the area that was once the hub of African-American life on Staten Island. Like so many other churches founded in predominantly black areas of the country, Rossville A.M.E. has had to adapt to major changes -- such as outward migration, new housing development, and gentrification -- all of which have changed the face and fabric of these communities, often making these churches the last original institutions left standing. 
“The dynamic that you’re seeing here is definitely playing out in other historic black communities that are facing redevelopment pressures,” said Derek Hyra, an associate professor of urban affairs and planning at Virginia Tech, who has studied similar trends occurring in Harlem and Washington, D.C.’s Shaw neighborhood. 
Today, the number of barbeques and other annual summer traditions once held by Rossville A.M.E. has declined drastically, along with the community’s dwindling black population. And with those fading traditions, much of the engagement that has kept the community strong during tough times has faded as well. The last barbeque congregants remember was held two or three years ago.
“We don’t have the same amount of people that’s involved,” said Cooper. “Even the kids, they’re not the same.”
Like most elder churchgoers, Cooper grew up in this small neighborhood located on the southern shore of Staten Island. She spent most of her youth racing about the yards of her neighbors, roller-skating down the steep hill where a grade school once stood, or making a game out of guessing the value of a car on the rare chance one would drive by her and her friends.
“A great percentage of the people remember their family stories, cherish their family stories, and maintain a real sense of family and interconnectedness,” said Carlotta DeFillo, 62, a librarian at Historical Richmond Town, a living history village and museum located in Staten Island. “They could look at a house or a street and say all the people that lived there generation after generation.”
But the sparsely filled pews on a recent Sunday indicated a major transformation. 
During that morning’s service, Reverend Janet Jones, 65, stood before her congregation and spoke with an assured optimism. When the New Jersey native became Reverend of Rossville A.M.E. in 2003, the church was losing more congregants than it was gaining. For the first seven years of Jones’ tenure, the church had only gained one new member as a steady procession of longtime congregants passed away. 
Nobody Knows The Trouble
The church was founded in 1850, while the original settlement of Sandy Ground was founded in the early 1800s by an group of vegetable farmers. The largest wave of settlers, black oystermen from Snow Hill, Md., established Sandy Ground after dreams of autonomy and freedom led them out of the south. A steady commitment to the oyster industry proved lucrative for the residents, allowing them to gradually attain both financial and social capital, such as well-built homes, thriving enterprises and high literacy rates.
A designated New York City landmark, Rossville A.M.E served as more than just the spiritual center of the community: It was a pillar of African American life throughout the region. 
“People could come here and find jobs,” said Sylvia Moody D'Alessandro, executive director of the Sandy Ground Historical Society and a descendant of Sandy Ground's original settlers. “It was the center of social life on the Eastern seaboard.”
At its height, Sandy Ground stood as a beacon of hard work and bootstrap success, until an unexpected series of catastrophes crippled the community’s growth. 
Pollution of nearby waters poisoned the area's oysters, resulting in several outbreaks of typhoid and the subsequent closing of the oyster beds in 1916. Fires in 1930 and 1963 would go on to destroy more than a dozen Sandy Ground homes and businesses. The lasting devastation heaped on the community forced residents to migrate to northern Staten Island, to Manhattan, and even New Jersey in search of work. Still, outside forces, including the nearby construction of the Verrazano Bridge, opened the floodgates for new housing developments and a predominantly white, affluent Catholic community to flourish in the wake of the black community’s decline.
Yvonne Taylor, 78, whose Sandy Ground roots reach back five generations, can count on two hands the number of African-American families living in Sandy Ground today. “90 percent of it used to be African-Americans,” she said. Now? “Say 10, perhaps 10. Eight to 10 black families are in this community.” 
Her family’s Sandy Ground home, designated as an official New York City landmark in 2011, stands in the same place, still in the family’s name, though she no longer resides there. Instead, she rents the home out. 
When asked if any black-owned businesses remained in the neighborhood, Taylor didn’t have to think too hard. “Unfortunately, no,” she said.
“They had to look for work elsewhere and that often meant picking up roots and moving someplace else,” Taylor said. “They relocated and never rebuilt.”
""It’s just changed,” said Marcia Munro-Emanuel, 66. “Now people have two-by-four yards and they think they own the world.”  Today, only two congregants of Rossville still live in the town. However, families with historical ties to Sandy Ground, such as Cooper and her four daughters, still travel from as far away as Willingboro, N.J., at least once a week to sit in the same pews as their forebears.
Rossville A.M.E. has struggled to help provide transportation for its congregants who don’t have any other means of getting to the church. When the church van broke down, many were left stranded. Some have even whispered at moving the church out of Sandy Ground, but Rev. Jones says uprooting the church and moving it closer to its far flung congregants is not an option.
“If you want to start a riot you can talk about relocating the church,” she warned. 
The church’s struggle to maintain its relevance speaks to the larger role religious institutions play in their communities, according to Gerald Gamm, an associate professor of political science and history at the University of Rochestor who has written on the urban Jewish exodus from Boston in the 1970s. 
“Religious institutions are the crossroads of a community,” he said, likening the role of Rossville in Sandy Ground to the role of Catholic churches in Boston.
“These churches and synagogues that we typically think of as just religious institutions only alive on Saturday and Sunday, in fact, become crucial building blocks of a community that normally function not only as religious places but as community centers,” Gamm added.
We Shall Overcome 
Young, eager and committed, Priscilla Briggs, 46, of New Brighton, N.J., represents what Rev. Jones hopes to be the future of Rossville A.M.E. Zion Church. Briggs learned of Rossville through her 9-year-old daughter, Amirah, who would attend the Sunday service through their daycare provider. After months of her daughter urging Briggs to join her, the mother finally followed her onto the church van one day. 
“Everybody on the van was like, ‘Yay!’,” Briggs said. “And I’ve been here ever since. It’s going to be two years in September.”
During her weekly welcome call-out to guests, Jones pointed out Warren Harding, a 20-year-old rising senior at Oberlin College and one of the three men in attendance. 
“You learn the history of the African-American community here, which was really important for us to have that solidarity in many ways,” said Harding, referring to his Jamaican grandmother’s migrating to the United States and choosing a church. “The other church didn’t have a lot of black folk in it.”
Harding, Briggs, Munro-Emanuel, Taylor, Cooper and about 30 other congregants, mostly restless children and older women, sat contentedly beside one another as Jones preached that Sunday: mothers sat next to nephews, and godmothers scooted towards sisters who leaned onto great aunts. 
They shared hushed whispers and worn Bibles. They punctuated Rev. Jones’ short sermon on duality with determined “Amen's"" and assured “Mhmm's"" before heading to the pulpit to receive communion. Afterwards, everyone lingered in the pews as pale sunlight passed through the stained glass windows bearing their ancestors names.  “This will always be my church,” said Munro-Emanuel before heading out on her hour long journey home. 
“This will always be my home.”

79,BLACK VOICES,"From 1967 Detroit To 2017, What Will It Take To Hold Police Officers Accountable?","Areva Martin, ContributorCivil Rights Attorney, TV Talk Show Host and Commentator, Auti...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-will-take-hold-police-accountable_us_59528c7ce4b0da2c731ee116,Justice continues to be elusive for the families of black men killed by police.,2017-06-27,VOICES,"Dateline – USA. Cops Kill Black Men with Impunity. It’s a headline that could appear any city newspaper in America, at almost any point in time. In this case, it’s Detroit 1967.
In what comes to be known as the Algiers Motel incident, police kill three young black men at the violent peak of the 1967 Detroit Riots, a cataclysmic event that left a total of 43 dead, and 342 injured. 
With so much death and violence during the riot’s four-day span, the officers who committed the killings at the hotel hoped their acts of savagery would get buried among the chaos and carnage.
But when the smoke and ashes cleared, the awful truth was revealed. Three white police officers, part of a riot taskforce that was searching for a suspected sniper, had tried to wring information out of hotel guests by viciously beating nine of them. Two of the officers took things a step further and killed three African American males.
Charges of felonious assault, conspiracy, murder and conspiracy to commit civil rights abuse were filed against three officers, but the patrolmen— practitioners of the blue code of silence—refused to testify against each other. All three men were found not guilty.
The tragic story of the 1967 riots and the Algiers Motel Incident is now the subject of the big screen movie “Detroit,” which opens nationwide in theaters in August. Directed by Academy Award-winning filmmaker Kathryn Bigelow—the driving force behind movies such as “The Hurt Locker” and “Zero Dark Thirty”—Detroit promises to be a powerful, provocative movie that sheds light on the distrustful, contentious relationship that’s existed between police and the black community for decades.
Many activists see the movie as a badly needed shot in the arm to a debate that in recent months has suffered from battle fatigue. Whereas several years ago the shootings of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown caused national outrage and resulted in saturation news coverage, recent police shootings have barely registered a blip on the public outrage meter. As pundits and the news media have become desensitized by the sheer number of black men shot by police, many civil rights advocates are hoping Detroit restarts a conversation that finally addresses head on why things have changed so little in 50 years. 
For many African Americans, police shootings have taken the form of tightly scripted horror films, where every scene has been heavily rehearsed.
According to the script, act one begins with police on patrol who encounter a black man who either moves “suspiciously” or “reaches” for a non-existent knife or gun, forcing officers who are in mortal fear of their lives to shoot the suspect into oblivion. In act two, after video evidences emerges that contradicts the police version of events, a skilled defense attorney or police union representative steps before a pool of cameras to tell the public that what happened before the filming started, what we can’t see in the video, is really what’s important. In act three, during the trial, if there is one at all, an emotional cop assumes the role of victim and repeats the “fear for his life” narrative to a jury. And finally, the jury—boxed in by narrow jury instructions—acquits the police officer while the devastated black family holds a press conference and cries for justice. The end. 
Last week, we saw this tired script played out again when police officer Jeronimo Yanez, charged with second degree manslaughter in the shooting death of motorist Philandro Castile, was acquitted of all charges. Yanez’s reason for pulling over Castile was supposedly a broken taillight, but on a police radio call recording that later surfaced, he is heard saying he’s stopping Castile because his “wide set nose” looks like that of a robbery suspect. 
Dashcam video also appears to contradict Yanez’s claims that Castile’s erratic behavior caused him to fear for his life. In the video, Castile is heard calmly responding to the officer’s questions, even volunteering that he has a firearm in his possession that he’s licensed to carry. Castile’s calm demeanor seems to put Yanez’s partner, Joseph Kauser, at ease, who is seen in the video striking a relaxed pose on the other side of vehicle. In fact, when called as a witness, Kauser testified that he never saw a gun in Castile’s car nor perceived the situation as potentially threatening—that is until gunshots started ringing out.
And yet despite the incriminating testimony and video evidence, Yanez was able—like so many other trigger-happy police officers—walk out of court a free man. The jury’s not guilty verdict left Castile’s family, pundits and thousands of people shocked and dismayed, asking what will it take to hold police officers accountable? 
In contrast, few people expected the police officers involved in the shooting at the Algiers Motel incident to be found guilty. The murders happened in 1967—a time of racial strife where Blacks still lived in segregated housing, black men were routinely referred to as “boys” and “niggers,” and justice in the courts was ambiguous at best. No one expected white police officer to confess the truth and expose the brutality that culminated in the cold- blooded murders of three black men. There were no body or dash cameras back then, and despite the eyewitness testimony of two white women and several black men who survived the savage violence perpetuated under the color of state sanctioned authority, the officers were acquitted after a state murder trial. They were also later acquitted after a federal civil rights trial. Incredulous on-lookers called the ridiculous verdicts a whitewash of a police slaying. 
Fast forward to 2017. Advances in technology—a myriad of civil rights laws, nationwide protests and federal civil rights investigations and lawsuits aimed at ending discriminatory law enforcement practices and wanton police brutality—have led to a different set of expectations. The compelling dash cam video evidence released following Yanez’s trial, the live Facebook video stream posted by Castile’s girlfriend in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, and the powerful implicating testimony from a police officer who was on the scene, led many people to believe a guilty verdict was all but assured. But despite the bevy of evidence, Castile’s shooter was acquitted. 
The acquittals in both cases highlight the significant barriers that African Americans face in holding police officers accountable. Whether it’s a broken criminal justice system that boxes the jury in because of antiquated legal standards set by a Supreme Court in the 1980s; or the implicit bias that poisons the hearts and minds of decent men and women who deny that they are racist, justice continues to be elusive for the families of black men killed by police.

80,BLACK VOICES,Here's How To Support Minority Communities Right Now,Zahara Hill,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heres-how-to-support-minority-communities-right-now_us_58261529e4b0c4b63b0c6f95,"""We can’t stand divided.”",2016-11-14,VOICES,"Donald Trump’s victory, and the numerous hate crimes that have come after it, has left many minorities fearing for their safety and in need of support. 
HuffPost’s Jay Shetty sat down with HuffPost Voices editors, including social media editor Rowaida Abdelaziz, last week to discuss how allies can support the millions of minorities in this country who are left feeling vulnerable in the wake of Trump’s win. Abdelaziz, who is Muslim, explained why it’s important for people who haven’t been historically oppressed to be involved in the fight for change and equality. 
“Marginalized communities have been [mobilizing] for a very long time,” she told Shetty. “And we’ve always had a voice. So, it’s not that we’re just starting out. It’s that we need to be amplified and that’s where the allies come in.”
One way to become involved, Abdelaziz said, is to surround yourself with different types of people and ask questions to educate yourself. She added that even the smallest demonstrations of support ― like leaving a kind note for your neighbor ― are invaluable during difficult times. 
“It doesn’t take very much to find a local mosque, to find a local Islamic school, to just walk into any community center and say, ‘I’m here to learn. I don’t agree with what’s going on out there. I don’t agree with the hate. I think this is wrong,’” Abdelaziz said.
Queer Voices editor Curtis Wong raised another point about how being an ally doesn’t mean making others your enemy ― regardless of how different opinions may be. “It’s important to remember not to necessarily fight with people but fight for people,” he said. 
Since Trump’s election, there has been a spike in hate crimes around the country. A University of Michigan Ann Arbor student reported last Friday that someone threatened to set her on fire if she didn’t take her off her hijab. On the same day, a Baylor University student was escorted to class by a group of student allies after tweeting that she had been pushed and called a “n****r” on her way to class earlier in the week. 
Latino Voices editor Carolina Moreno addressed how allies should react when they witness hatred. “What we need now is empathy and not apathy, especially in the face of hate and violence,” she said. “You don’t have to start throwing punches, you can walk the person home. When you’re the victim and you’re being attacked, you feel alone in that moment.”
In addition to the presence of allies, the editors agreed that minority groups also need to come together for continued progress. 
“Our own individual struggles are still there,” Black Voices senior editor Lilly Workneh said. “But now we have a collective struggle and fight and we all have to band together and attack that...we can’t stand divided.”

When these ladies -- Nadrea Njoku, Jasmine Haywood, Johari Shuck, Tiffany Kyser, Demetrees Hutchins, Jada Phelps-Moultrie, Juhanna Rogers and Shannon McCullough -- began their respective doctoral programs at the Indiana University School of Education, they realized how few women of color had come before them at the school.
""We understood very early on that we had a distinction, a commonality, a thread between all of us and so we began to meet as a group,"" said PhD candidate Nadrea Njoku.
Dubbed ""the great eight,"" the candidates used the common thread they shared to break new ground at the university. They uplifted, motivated and encouraged one another right to the finish line. 
""We often deal with this idea that we always have to do more,"" Haywood told Fox 59. ""And our collective black female community, here, we were able to tell each other you're enough."" 
This will be the first time the university has ever had so many black woman complete a doctoral program at one time. Shuck told the news outlet that the group leaned on each other for emotional support, especially when the anxiety of being one of the only persons of color weighed heavy.
""When you're the only or one of a handful of people of color in the classroom particularly when it comes to speaking about issues of race,"" Haywood said. ""You can often become the token or spokesperson.""
The group said they want their work to inspire other women of color to thrive. 
""If we get more images of showing us in these positive lights,"" Hutchins said, ""then we can truly say this is nothing special because it happens all the time. So until we get to that point we'll be the great eight and we'll shine that light on it.""
After graduating in May, the women will defend their dissertations this summer. They will also meet with school leadership to talk about ways to make their program more inclusive.

As of Tuesday, “Get Out,” a psychological thriller about racism, has earned $110 million in box-office sales, making Jordan Peele the first black writer-director to break the coveted $100 million threshold with a feature debut.
Peele humbly acknowledged his accomplishment Tuesday:
There have been several black directors who have had their feature debut pass that mark, as noted by BlackFilm.com, however, none have earned that status with their own screenplay. “Get Out” is also the fastest film from production company Blumhouse to reach the $100 million mark, earning that status in just 16 days, according to Deadline.
Peele, a comedian widely known for his Comedy Central show “Key & Peele,” made his directorial debut with “Get Out.” The film was made on just a $4.5 million budget and has since become a real standout in Hollywood. 
“Get Out” follows the experiences of a young black man who heads to a rural town to visit his white girlfriend’s family for the first time. The weekend away turns out to be a puzzling and suspense-filled trip where the young man realizes that the white people who live in and visit the home don’t have the best intentions. 
The movie has earned much acclaim among moviegoers and critics alike, who have praised the film’s brilliant and mind-bending take on race. Some film reviewers have called it a “watershed feat,” while others credit Peele for directing a clever thriller that explores various aspects of being black in America. The film even earned a 100 percent score on the film review site Rotten Tomatoes in its first 40 reviews, and the good news doesn’t stop there. 
Peele said he plans on releasing an entire series of “social thrillers” that fuse horror with daily human experiences. He plans to unveil four more films that follow this theme within the next decade.
“There’s several other ideas that have been germinating for the past eight years, and I’d like to do all of them,” Peele told The Verge in a recent interview. “As far as I’m concerned, my next decade or so — along with helping other untapped artists, or untapped identities, find their own platforms as a producer — I want to write and direct these four other social thrillers.”

Ali, who stopped by HuffPost last week to promote Colgate Bright Smiles, Bright Futures, spoke about the recent controversy around the San Francisco 49ers quarterback. She said she champions Kaepernick for his response to racial inequality and police brutality in America.
“I commend Colin Kaepernick because he had a lot of courage,” Ail told host Jacques Morel. “And you could tell that it’s not something he did not put a lot of thought into. He knows what he’s talking about.”
Kaepernick’s political statement has drawn heavy criticism, but Ali drew a parallel to her late father, boxing legend Muhammed Ali. In addition to his athletic legacy, Ali was also notorious for publicly condemning racial injustice. 
“He’s going to reference Muhammad Ali and how they may have hated him back then. People didn’t always love him you know and now what he’s become,” Ali continued. “You know, people can’t always see the end of the road.""
She then praised the quarterback’s commitment to speak out about an issue he believes in deeply.
“He’s very passionate about it and he’s trying to speak up for people who can’t speak for themselves,” Ali said. “But at the same time, I don’t expect everybody to do it because everybody is not that individual.” 
In addition to her thoughtful commentary, Ali also filled us in on her new venture with Colgate’s Bright Smiles Futures. Her partnership with the organization will help impart the significance of oral hygiene to underserved children.

FaceApp, the popular phone app which allows users to digitally alter their selfies, released a new set of filters on Wednesday designed to make the user look either Asian, black, caucasian or Indian. Needless to say, people are not impressed. 
According to Engadget, the FaceApp originally just had filters to add a smile, make a user look older or younger, and change gender using its “deep learning technologies.” But with the new update, users can see what they look like with deeper or lighter skin, and facial features usually associated with specific ethnicities. 
The app has been charged with giving people access to digital blackface brownface, and yellowface. Social media users have (perhaps counterintuitively) began posting selfies of themselves using the app in order to highlight what many are calling a racist app:
 Others are pointing out that the app filters are not OK:
This is not the first time FaceApp has faced criticism over racial insensitivity. In April, the app was forced to delete a “hot” filter which essentially made users appear more white.

“The ethnicity change filters have been designed to be equal in all aspects,” Goncharov explained.
“They don’t have any positive or negative connotations associated with them. They are even represented by the same icon. In addition to that, the list of those filters is shuffled for every photo, so each user sees them in a different order.”

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/monsanto-problems_us_573dcea4e4b0646cbeec3d6c,"The agricultural giant seems like it ""forgot to sacrifice a goat to the gods.""",2016-05-19,BUSINESS,"Monsanto's list of problems is growing like a weed.
Now, the world's largest seed company seems vulnerable to a $42 billion takeover bid by its German rival Bayer, maker of the eponymous Aspirin brand. And that's just the latest sign of trouble for Monsanto. 
""It's a relentless string of bad news,"" Jonas Oxgaard, an analyst at the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., told Bloomberg News' Jen Skerritt this week. ""It's almost like they forgot to sacrifice a goat to the gods."" 
Here are all the things that have gone wrong at Monsanto this year:
  In January, the company laid off a total of 3,600 employees, or about 16 percent of its workforce.   In February, Swiss competitor Syngenta agreed to the China National Chemical Corp.'s acquisition offer, just months after refusing for a fourth time to sell itself to Monsanto.    In March, the maker of RoundUp weed killer slashed its earnings forecast for the year amid economic headwinds from low commodity prices.   Earlier this month, two of the largest U.S. grain traders refused to buy a new type of Monsanto's genetically modified soybean because European Union regulators have yet to approve it.   The firm is locked in ongoing disputes over seed royalties in Argentina and India.   Its stock price has fallen by as much as 31 percent in the past 12 months, according to Bloomberg.  
In a statement, Monsanto confirmed on Wednesday that its board of directors planned to review Bayer's offer, the same day Chief Operating Officer Brett Begemann denied talk of a deal as ""wild speculation.""
""There is no assurance that any transaction will be entered into or consummated, or on what terms,"" the company said in the statement.
Monsanto spokeswoman Christi Dixon declined to comment to The Huffington Post.
The move by Bayer comes amid increasing consolidation in the chemical industry. Dow Chemical and DuPont Co. announced plans in December to merge into a $130 billion giant. By buying Syngenta for $43 billion, the Chinese state-owned ChemChina could become the world's largest supplier of crop-protection products. As the Wall Street Journal's Christopher Alessi noted on Thursday, taking over Monsanto may be Bayer's last chance to bulk up and avoid being sidelined as a ""second-tier crop player."" 
Founded in 1901 in St. Louis as a producer of chemicals such as Agent Orange, Monsanto was voted the ""world’s most evil company"" by Natural News readers in 2013. Notoriously litigious, the firm has sued everyone from farmers who save its seeds — the company ferociously defends its patents — to European food regulators who refuse to legalize its products. 
By sheer virtue of its market dominance, Monsanto's genetically modified crops and insecticides play a crucial role in feeding the world's growing population. The firm, used to its reputation as one of the most hated companies in the world, defends itself as a necessary player in the fight to feed 9 billion humans by 2050.
Still, groups such as the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists accuse Monsanto of hampering efforts to make farming more sustainable. 
""They're an aggressive company when it comes to the marketing and the PR and the reassuring everyone constantly that [GMOs] are safe,"" Patty Lovera, assistant director at the food industry advocacy group Food & Water Watch, told HuffPost by phone. ""They're also very aggressive in their business practices when it comes to selling seeds, and they have an enormous amount of control over the building blocks of the food industry.""

It's time for you to focus on the real problem with the banking system and stop looking for saviors. It's banking policy, not people, Joe, that needs changing.",2012-06-17,BUSINESS,"Joe Nocera's lastest column on banking juxtaposes good banker, Citigroup's Vikram Pandit, with bad banker, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon. Pandit, Nocera tells us, is good because his bank invests in good assets, namely U.S. Treasuries. Dimon is bad because his bank invests in bad assets, derivatives and the like, which recently lost a lot of money. 
Joe clearly likes Pandit's demeanor and doesn't like Dimon's. Dimon has ""swagger."" He likens Pandit, who Joe says has no swagger, to former Citigroup chief, Walter Wriston, ""one of the great bankers of the modern era."" I had lunch a while back with the late Walt Wriston and, there's no question, Wriston had no swagger. 
Joe's column is entitled ""The Safest Bank,"" so he's not only saying that Pandit has no swagger, but that he also saying Pandit has the safest bank. And in choosing this title, Joe's leading the reader to equate no swagger with having a safe bank. 
This is about as naive and off base as it gets. 
First, no swagger Wriston invested huge sums in Latin America and lost a bundle for Citigroup -- four years of earnings to be precise. In reviewing Philip Zweig biography of Wriston, the New York Times concluded that ""Mr. Wriston's goal was for profit increases of 15 percent a year. What this inevitably did was to push the bank's culture toward excesses. Mr. Zweig provides us with many of these, from bribes of foreign officials, to large sums of money simply disappearing, to the booking of transactions in offices other than where they took place, to Asian drug running.""
When Wriston died, Paul Volcker recalled that, in thinking about Wriston, ""The word aggressive keeps coming back."" The New York Times wrote that ""the two clashed over Mr. Wriston's contention that banks no longer needed high levels of capital as long as they were profitable, well managed and growing. In the end, Mr. Wriston won out: capital restrictions today are much lower.""
Wriston, in short, was no Jimmy Stewart, a.k.a. George Bailey. As for Pandit, his ""safest"" bank just scored lower than JP Morgan in March's Fed's stress test. Indeed, Citigroup was one of four banks that the Fed singled out as particularly risky -- so risky that the Fed denied its request to pay out a dividend. 
Joe, on the off chance you are reading this, let me now address you directly. 
I'm not suggesting that JP Morgan is a better run bank than Citigroup. Your faith in Pandit may be justified. Maybe you know something the Fed doesn't know. But it sure sounds like you are saying that a bank is safe if it's CEO is a modest guy, even if he likes to gamble big time. 
The reality is that the huge banks are so big that no single person can oversee what they are doing. The JP Morgan derivative deal that went south demonstrates this. Dimon, apparently, had little clue about this mega trade that he now says was stupid and reckless. Nor, for that matter, did any of our government regulators. 
So Joe, it's not about Jamie or Pandit being more or less like Wriston. The problem is not with the guy at the top. Jimmy Stewart Is Dead. He's not coming back. We're not going to have a safe financial system by putting more likable people in charge. 
And suggesting, as you do, Joe, that Pandit is not only likable, but also playing it safe by investing in U.S. Treasuries ignores the lesson we've learned repeatedly over the last five years -- a lesson that I will spell out for you in caps: THERE ARE NO SAFE ASSETS! 
AIG was rated AAA, Lehman's Bonds were rated AAA, Italian bonds were selling at prices close to those of German Bunds in 2005, top tier CDO tranches were rated AAA, and the list goes on. And, Joe, you might recall that U.S. Treasuries used to be AAA. Now they are AA+. 
In my view, U.S. Treasuries are among the riskiest assets in the world today given that the U.S. government is in worst fiscal shape than any developed country when you consider the long-term picture. The fact, Joe, that you judge U.S. Treasuries to be absolutely safe indicates to me that you haven't looked at these facts either.
Joe, we're not going to get a safe banking system by appointing bankers that you decide, this week, are good guys. We're going to get a safe banking system when we eliminate opacity and leverage, which is easily done by restricting financial corporations to do one thing only, market 100-percent equity financed mutual funds and by having a federal agency vet and disclose on the web in real time all elements of all securities being bought, held, and sold by the mutual funds. 
Joe, you are the New York Times chief columnist on banking. It's time for you to focus on the real problem with the banking system and stop looking for saviors. It's banking policy, not people, Joe, that needs changing. 
best, Larry

Wu, ContributorAuthor, Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/asian-americans-versus-asian-americans_us_58a9f2a9e4b0fa149f9ac7a6,Asian immigrants are disappointed Asian Americans are not more welcoming even as they fear their own children will turn into Asian Americans.,2017-02-19,BUSINESS,"I have realized how much more bridge building is needed among and by Asian Americans. I recently attended an event a good friend of mine organized in Northern California. Karthick Ramakrishnan is the most prominent scholar on Asian American political participation; it’s probably him if anyone is in the media talking about the subject. A professor of South Asian descent, he has wanted to convene a pan-Asian coalition to advance shared interests. He has started the process, but it will take energy to sustain.
Critics of hyphenated identity claim it divides. They want us all to be simply American. They are not aware that “Asian American” is all about forming a union among people whose ancestors would not have been committed to any contact other than conquest.
Both words in the title are important. They are signals to others and one’s self. Asians are amalgamating as other immigrant communities have done in overcoming their past hatreds for the common ground of this democracy. The insistence on the American aspect of identity also is an assertion that one belongs here.
Ironically, when I was growing up, my only wish was to be accepted as simply American, and I was all too eager in assuming if I avoided anything Asian that would be so, automatically — exactly as the puppet Pinocchio became a real boy, in one of those Western fairy tales we memorized though our parents had not heard of it. “Asian American” is better than the names, the various ethnic slurs emitted by passersby and cranks on the telephone and strangers who rang the doorbell and ran off.
Of course Asian Americans are artificial. That is true of all human groupings by definition. Asian American is perhaps more deliberately constructed. It depends on constant effort to hold together.
East Asians and South Asians in particular are competitive even as colleagues. When other people say, “You all look alike,” they mean they are likely to confuse Chinese for Japanese, not brown for yellow. There are discrete cultural origins: while much of East Asia has linguistic and religious relationships dating back before national borders were set or nations were even a clear concept under law, the Indian subcontinent speaks a dialect of the Indo-European language family and more than a few persons have lineage that is Caucasian.
The function I went to was inspired by a conversation between someone East Asian, native born, and someone South Asian, an immigrant, who were candid about infighting. They did what leaders do, turn opposition into opportunity.
What unites these rivals in places such as Silicon Valley is that they form an enemy for those who deem people of color as a threat. Asians might not even have been conscious that they appeared as a menace, having no aspiration other than prosperity. For those around them who are certain demography is destiny, that very success looks like a hostile takeover.
Asian Americans, however, are registering the antagonism. They cannot help but notice it. Tech leaders are saying they cannot “outsource” the response to civil rights activists alone. So Asians who want their cousins to be able to come here have reason to join together to advocate.
Although their lack of enthusiasm for politics is faulted, their attempts to join movements likewise has met backlash. They are viewed with suspicion for their loyalties and motives.
Asian Americans also should reach across the Pacific Ocean. Asian Americans who are assimilated, some of them, have distanced ourselves as deliberately as possible. We are too wary. I count myself among those who have made this error. They — we — have learned to be cautious, because suspicions fall upon them (us) if they utter a word hinting they (we) are anything less than America Firsters. The display of indifference toward a “homeland” they/we left, were forced from, or perhaps have never set foot on (as the third generation on these shores) turns into authentic apathy. Even as others lacking the heritage take up Mandarin for an adventure, we are reluctant to expose ourselves to the disdain casually directed at our parents who had accents. We find ourselves on both sides of the line: “them” versus “us” is ambiguous for Asian Americans even if we are suffer no ambivalence on our part.
We can withhold judgment of those who adapt under the circumstances. If you find yourself the one and only child in the classroom who looks like you, especially adopted or mixed, you have no genuine choice. You cannot be expected to maintain a culture without critical mass around you.
Yet there remains a responsibility assigned to Asian Americans, regardless of their reluctance to take it on, of serving as intermediaries, translators literally and figuratively. The epiphany for many is that acquiescing to the role is in one’s self-interest, and it offers enriching experiences. You give in and learn it doesn’t impose but relieves a burden: to speak with your grandparents across generations is to speak to the other half of the world, and you are the better for it, not least in the eyes of your elders.
The last line is the most difficult to overcome, because it is internal. It is not subtle. The established members of the ethnicity and those who in that pejorative phrase coming to be appropriated with pride, “fresh off the boat” are not the same. Their mutual contempt may exceed that of observers who could not distinguish between them, aggravating them even further. There is a “disconnect” between Asian Americans who conceive of themselves as domestic racial minorities and Asian immigrants whose reference point is literally foreign. The Asian Americans who march with “Black Lives Matter” perplex the Asian immigrants, perhaps their own parents, whose sympathies are elsewhere.
These populations in fact are distinct. Old-timers came when America was the dream and Asia “backward;” newcomers, as Asia ascends and America becomes increasingly anxious. The former had to leave behind their village without any assurance they would see their family again, ever, as much due to the distance and the cost as geopolitical barriers that included concrete roadblocks. The latter connect via social media as if they had never departed; they are effectively transnational, enjoying the same jokes and soap opera as before they boarded the jumbo jet for a routine trip.
The alarm each side feels is troubling — but not as they imagine. An observer who could step away or imagine a vantage point in the not too far future would perceive that the established Asian Americans, like white ethnics, Jews, and Hispanics who are not Latinos before them, fear those coming later will spoil everything with their rudeness, their lack of refinement, their foreign ways, their arrogant disregard about fitting in, and, above all, their overwhelming numbers. If the volume of Asian immigrants in line (or not bothering to follow the protocols for queuing) bothers white Americans as a portent of power shifting, the quantity undoubtedly will disenfranchise Asian Americans who settled long ago. On their part, Asian immigrants are disappointed Asian Americans are not more welcoming even as they fear their own children will turn into Asian Americans. They, also like their predecessors of all types and every era, hope for the comfort of continuity, to be very much in America but not necessarily of America.
“Asian American” is all about bridge building. Bridge building is vital, in every direction. That means among Asian ethnicities, both East and South; to Asians overseas; and to Asians arriving now. Then there is bridge building to blacks and whites. Asian Americans, neither black nor white, can be intermediaries and mediators.
Karthick’s research is definitive. He leads a study of Asian American civic engagement. His data shows Asian Americans are a potential influence. Their numbers are headed up, and they are, on average (with caveats), educated and affluent. Yet by conventional predictors, their civic engagement is not as robust as could be.
I have confidence. America is an ongoing experiment. It is a project, thanks to the democratic process. It is not a product, to be bought and sold. It is messy, always incomplete, needing work. Asians can contribute to progress. We have to feel the desire to do so.

Unfortunately, the system is still massively broke.",2014-09-08,BUSINESS,"The 21st century organization requires bold leaders who understand they live in a world of opportunity to create and lead others around a shared purpose. Unfortunately, the system is still massively broke. Most so-called leaders are stuck leading 20th-century organizations where they delegate their responsibilities to functions. Someone else ghostwrites their blogs and makes sure diverse teams are built. And then they wonder why they have a disengaged and homogenous workforce.
Stuck in the Old World
We have old world concepts like engagement and empowerment flying around the corporate walls. No one really wants to admit they don't know what they mean or more importantly, what to do with them. Have you ever seen an empowered workforce? Was it words on a PowerPoint slide or an HBR article? 
Listening has become a transactional event of running an annual employee survey or performance management meeting. Why have we lost the ability to conduct two-way conversations whenever they are needed? Why is it that we talk to our customers regularly and then practice archaic management practices when it comes to what we publish on our Intranets as our ""most important assets""? Why are people still called headcount where on a financial spreadsheet, furniture is an asset and people are a liability?
Wake up to the New Reality
It's time to wake up and realize it's a new century in a world of possibilities and opportunities that are not in the mainstream but on the edges. Leadership today is also on the edges since we don't have to follow the prescribed solutions that don't work in our new world of work. Leaders who get this no longer delegate their communication to a function. They work out loud and experiment while leading with conscious purpose.
Some Leaders Are Breaking Through
I am lucky enough to partner with such a leader and see her in action building an engaged network of innovators. She listens and takes risks. She doesn't wait for the annual survey to listen. She brings in the best internal an external talent to drive her organization to the next level. I have experienced one brave leader who leads through creating and doing.
And we need many more to practice conscious leadership as the workforce is changing so fast and those who are stuck will not survive what is about to take place in the world of work. No technology in the world will help unless we start shifting and integrating the technology into our business rather than trying to lead with it, which ultimately fails. It's about re-imagining leadership in a post-hero world where every person can make a difference. 
And it's definitely not easy. If it was, everyone would be doing it. There is no cookie cutter approach as the new model of leadership requires knowing how to deal with failure and disappointment and stepping into unchartered territory. The 21st century leader is a dreamer who sees the possibilities by creating new markets. She leaves the job for competing for marketshare to someone else. And taps into people in all generations across all geographies with drive and purpose on a human level.
Do you know 21st century leaders? What makes them lead with the courage to be vulnerable and create healthy organizations that thrive?

But very few of those biz babes get the opportunity to appear on ABC's hit show, Shark Tank. Even fewer of those ladies actually walk back down that long, dark hallway with a deal in hand.
Jenny Greer and Erin Bickley of Macon, Georgia not only appeared in The Tank and got a first time partnership deal (with both lady sharks Barbara and Lori), they thrived shortly thereafter with their collection of products from their women's shape-wear business Hold Your Haunches.
At the time of their TV appearance, the ladies had a $165,000 sales year. Six short months after their appearance and partnership, they had one-and-a half million in sales and going strong.
Touching base with these amazing Georgia peaches is an inspirational story and a vision of what it looks like to go from real-life, struggling entrepreneur to successful momma CEOs seemingly overnight (but it wasn't that easy).
The first topic of discussion was around some of the struggles they faced, both now and then. Erin and Jenny said that ""ignorance was bliss"" for them. They really just started by seeing a need and jumping in, developing their first prototype. The lesson? Take one step, then another, then another. Just one at a time.
""The struggle wasn't really visible, we were busy getting things perfected like the marketing and building a brand,"" the duo said. In other words, they were deep in making things happen, one step at a time.
Post Shark Tank, Erin said that overnight the business really became a full time job which was tough, especially between with their respective husband's and kids' needs.
""We love the example that we're setting for our kids though, especially our daughters. You really can do anything if you try,"" both ladies agreed.
Business partnerships do sometimes crash and burn and some people get sick of each other or decide to go their separate ways. Both Jenny and Erin agreed that it's important to ""make sure that you love the person because you're with them all of the time."" Partnerships are totally possible, not easy all of the time, but possible.
They do love being around each other. They pointed out that their partnership has really gotten them through some of the hard times and that they've been a security blanket to each other in the more difficult stages. The partnership was an asset for them.
""I can't imagine doing this alone,"" They both agreed.
When asked about one piece of advice for other ambitious business mommas, the ladies chimed in saying, ""There are things that are totally out of your control, just get things ready as much as you can. We've had server glitches before and things like that. Just tell the truth to your customers. What you put out comes back.""
Excellent advice from two ladies continuing massive growth of their now successful business, a business we're sure to see a lot of in the years to come, and proof that anything is possible.

“While we remain committed to supporting the children and families affected by autism, we are canceling Monday's Give Back Event based on the feedback we heard from our guests,"" a Chili’s Grill & Bar spokesperson said to The Huffington Post in an email. ""We believe autism awareness continues to be an important cause to our guests and team members, and we will find another way to support this worthy effort in the future with again our sole intention being to help families affected by autism.""
--
Enjoying a Triple Dipper at Chili's on Monday? Some of your money will be going toward anti-vaccination efforts.
On April 7, the restaurant chain will be donating 10 percent of customers' checks to the National Autism Association in honor of National Autism Awareness month. On its website, the NAA claims that vaccinations can expedite autism in ""some, if not many, children.""
Though the anti-vaccination movement has gained steam in recent years, more and more data shows that anti-vaccination efforts can result in outbreaks of preventable diseases like measles. The Center for Disease Control has repeatedly disputed the idea of a causal relationship between vaccinations and the development of autism in children.
On its website, the NAA doesn't make a definitive statement about vaccinations and autism, instead directing users to the National Vaccine Information Center, a nonprofit organization. In his book Denialism, journalist Michael Specter writes that the ""NVIC is the most powerful anti-vaccine organization in America, and its relationship with the U.S. government consists almost entirely of opposing federal efforts aimed at vaccinating children.""
Chili's has already felt backlash from its decision to donate proceeds to the NAA, issuing a defensive statement to its nearly 4 million Facebook fans on Friday.
""The intent of our 4/7 National Give Back Event is not to express a view on this matter, but rather to support the families affected by autism,"" Chili's writes in the post. ""Our choice to partner with the National Autism Association was based on the percentage of donations that would go directly to providing financial assistance to families and supporting programs that aid the development and safety of children with autism."" 
The majority of comments on the post are strongly critical of Chili's' choice to partner up with the NAA.
""I am incredibly disappointed with [Chili's] and their decision to host an event/contribute funds to an organization that will directly result in sick and dead children,"" one comment reads. ""Hosting a fundraiser for an organization that encourages parents not to vaccinate their children is not only irresponsible, but also unforgivable. If your restaurant goes through with the fundraiser on april 7 [sic], I will never eat at one of your restaurants again.""
Chili's did not return a request for comment Sunday.
Those looking to contact Chili's can do so through its website.

This definitely makes you want to plop down $100,000 on a Model S, right? 
Tesla hasn't commented on the video, but did retweet TED curator Chris Anderson, who wrote, ""How many auto companies have fans that would do this?""
Elon Musk, the automaker's chief executive, has long advocated for a future that is no longer dependent on diesel and gasoline. That doesn't mean that Tesla's electric cars will be completely free of the guilt of carbon emissions though: Most of these vehicles draw their charges from a power grid that uses fossil fuels, and there are huge shipping costs involved in getting the cars to global buyers.

For the past quarter century, capitalism in the advanced economies has moved forward in an impressive but not inclusive fashion. The winners are clear. First, it is industries that trade outside of their own local area, such as pharmaceuticals or software. These innovate and upgrade in order to compete broadly and achieve large scale. They have prospered relative to dispersed industries, such as local banking or healthcare provision, that don't trade outside their own area. Second, it is workers who are asked to use their creativity to engage in independent judgment and decision making at work. Such workers have high job security and have experienced healthy wage growth. This is in stark comparison to those who are asked to carry out routine intensive, repetitive tasks who not only feel intense wage pressure but also have little or no job security. 
In combination, the very biggest winners are creative workers in traded industries. This fortunate 13.9% of the American workforce earns a 78.5% premium over the national average - a premium that has grown smartly from 74.0% in 2000. At the other end of the scale are routine workers in local industries. They make up by far the biggest category of U.S. employment at 44.8% of workers. Their wages are low and falling further behind: in 2000, they earned 31.7% less than the U.S. national average and by 2014 the gap had widened to 36.8%. Capitalism gives the former group a warm and lucrative embrace while the latter gets the cold shoulder.
In order to produce a more broadly inclusive capitalism, we need to see a transformation in how work is structured and valued. The economy can't depend solely on the slow substitution of creative jobs for routine jobs. The creative content of routine jobs must be enhanced.
Currently, there is a self-fulfilling prophecy in the routine sector of the economy. If employers discourage or prohibit independent judgment and decision-making, jobs become and remain routine jobs where low pay is commensurate with the low ability of the employee to create value in these conditions. These low-paid, low-skill jobs then cannot attract the kind of applicant that would have the skills to upgrade the job, setting in motion a vicious cycle.
If instead, employers purposefully create workplace environments that promote employee judgment and decisionmaking, even seemingly routine jobs can and will become more creativity-intensive. This, in turn, will improve productivity and enable the employer to pay higher wages. Ultimately, it will attract better talent to these positions, creating a virtuous circle.
In this way, the creativity-intensity of routine jobs will increase and indeed hasten the replacement of routine jobs with creative jobs. While there are undoubtedly those who would argue that this is impossible - believing that routine jobs will always be routine jobs - history shows that leading companies have won in their industries in part by encouraging independent judgment and decision-making from employees who would be seen and treated as routine workers in competitor companies.
Take Toyota, Four Seasons, QuikTrip, Trader Joes, Whole Foods and Costco. These companies have made it a central feature of their strategies to provide workers with more decision-making authority and more opportunities to display independent judgment. They have also paid commensurately higher wages. The result is a virtuous circle of higher wages, higher sales, lower employee turnover, superior customer service, improved productivity, and striking competitive success. This is the fastest and most productive way forward for the U.S. economy: the transformation of a routine intensive exclusionary economy into a more inclusive, creativity-intensive one.

But an excellent place to start is by taking advantage of the stories that are already getting noticed.
Breaking news stories, the latest trends and current affairs are more likely to capture your target audience's attention, generate social sharing and encourage brand engagement.

Seizing stories that are trending in the news and online, a concept known as 'newsjacking' is an excellent way to get key messages in the media, provide expert opinions and build thought leadership.
Here are some strategies to follow when looking to take advantage of trending news stories.
Pick the right story You need to be able to determine which stories are going to work for the message you have crafted. Only leverage stories which would engage your audience and relate directly to your brand and business.
For example, if you run an insurance company and you notice a lot of stories in the media about rising insurance premiums, you can pitch yourself to a relevant journalist as an expert to comment on these issues. 
Be prepared  Be proactive and prepare for all possible opportunities. Think about topics which relate to your area of expertise and brainstorm any possible news events that could be related to these topics. You can then reactively pitch to news outlets when a similar story emerges. 
Media and social media monitoring A big part of this process is monitoring the conversations in the media and on social media. By keeping up to date, you will be better able to pick up on stories that will work. 
Following journalists and news outlets on Twitter is an excellent way to keep informed of all breaking news stories and find media opportunities. Twitter allows you to organise followers into separate lists which can make it easier to view recent tweets from journalists and news outlets. 
Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have streams which showcase what news stories and topics are the most popular with users. 
Accessing these trending topics provides an insight into what your target audience is talking about and what content they are engaging with. 
Be timely Timeliness is very important in terms of capitalising on breaking news. It is important to be aware of what's going on in your industry. 
When you do find something relevant to your industry and have something appropriate to respond with, it is a good idea to post a response through your social media, through a blog post, or reach out to the media. 
Be resourceful When responding to a trending news story, it is important to be as informative and resourceful as possible. Provide journalists with new material they haven't directly written about before and ensure that you are offering an expert opinion or advice to back up your story.
Offering a different angle to current trending stories is an excellent way to pique a journalist's interest in your story. 
It is important to remember that not every news story will be suitable to respond to. You need to approach leveraging trending news stories ethically and sensitively. Think about the ways that you can use real time engagement authentically. 
With the right approach, preparation and consideration you can leverage the latest new stories and trends to get noticed.

Decades of experiments have proven that happy employees are better at creative problem solving, which drives engagement and financial results.",2015-05-29,BUSINESS,"Enlightened, successful organizations understand that people are at the core of their success. Decades of experiments have proven that happy employees are better at creative problem solving, which drives engagement and financial results. And engaged employees are more likely to stay at companies for the long haul. 
What do people need to feel fulfilled at work? At the most basic level, people want to come to work happy and leave happy. They look for meaning and value at work, and want to understand how their efforts help their company succeed. They need camaraderie, friendship and meaning -- to stay connected to and engaged with their colleagues. They crave recognition for their contributions to the organization.
Results from Globoforce's Fall 2014 Workforce Mood Tracker Survey show that 89 percent of workers feel that work relationships are important to their quality of life. According to the survey, 78 percent of people spend 30-50 hours a week at work, while only 24 percent spend that much time with their families. All of this culminates in the need for a workplace defined by humanity, something many companies fail to embrace as a core value. It's time to change that and double down on the human side of work.
Here are five ways to bring more humanity into the workplace:
Say Thank You
William James, one of the founders of modern psychology, wrote in 1896, ""The deepest principle of Human Nature is the craving to be appreciated."" The simple act of saying thank you openly and often creates a bond between giver and receiver and breaks through social barriers so that loyalty, trust and dedication can flow more freely. When employers empower their people to recognize one another's contributions, a groundswell of gratitude emerges. Saying thank you also identifies and encourages the right behaviors, inspiring a shared purpose and vision. 
Nurture a Culture of Trust
A workplace that becomes happy and stays happy is no accident -- it's created with intent and purpose. While you can't make people come to work happy, you can support a culture that encourages people to be their best, most positive selves. In a positivity dominated workplace fueled by recognition, employees and managers are encouraging each other, learning from successes and failures, noticing and celebrating behaviors that embody company values. This results in a culture defined by trust. China Gorman, the CEO of the Great Place to Work Institute, describes a great workplace as ""one which employees trust management, enjoy camaraderie with fellow workers, and feel pride in their work. 
Recognize Generational Differences 
We now have three distinct generations in the workplace, each with a unique take on how work can achieve personal and professional goals. Multigenerational workforces succeed when a single set of cultural values unites people in their work while accommodating different needs. Identifying these needs, creating a dialogue, making connections and finding similarities is key to embracing generational differences and achieving success. 
Create a Culture of Recognition 
By creating a culture of recognition through a consistent peer-to-peer program, workers feel more valued and motivated to do great work. It creates a community of support and positivity. Take the program a step further and broadcast moments recognition throughout the company. As people are recognized and give recognition, a contagious energy emerges and the act of celebrating people's achievements becomes a fixture in the culture. 
Embrace the Social Workplace
We stay at work for the people. Work friendships and colleague support are the bedrock of our work experience as our work becomes increasingly interdependent, with all kinds of expertise needed at different stages of a project. By leveraging social technology as the driving force behind a recognition program, you can create and amplify a culture of positive, validating and motivating communication that helps those relationships thrive.

101,BUSINESS,Founders Finding Funding From Friends May Be Fools,"Marty Zwilling, ContributorVeteran Start-up Mentor; Executive",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/founders-finding-funding_b_5961260.html,"In their passion to succeed, too many entrepreneurs treat friends and family investments as ""low-hanging"" fruit, only to find out later, after a stumble, that the pain of lost relationships is greater than the loss of their beloved startup.",2014-10-09,BUSINESS,"In their passion to succeed, too many entrepreneurs treat friends and family investments as ""low-hanging"" fruit, only to find out later, after a stumble, that the pain of lost relationships is greater than the loss of their beloved startup. Other entrepreneurs never start their adventure, because they can't face the prospect of even approaching friends and family for an investment kick-start.
The only way an entrepreneur can really dodge this issue is to totally fund the startup with personal funds (bootstrapping). Then you don't have to worry about the fact that most Angel investors and venture capitalists won't take a bet on you if none of your friends and family have given you a vote of confidence with money.
This is a sensitive and critical area for new entrepreneurs, and it's important to get it right the first time. Brian S. Cohen and John Kador, in their recent book What Every Angel Investor Wants You to Know, includes these best points of practical advice I've seen recently on this subject:
 Manage expectations before the fact. Even if you passionately believe that your idea is a winner, it's smart to remind friends of the historical facts with startups. More than 50% fail in the first two years, and even the ""overnight successes"" take six years on the average. In the interim, there is no market for the shares, and no dividends or interest.  
 Make sure the money is discretionary. If friends and family are still willing to take the risk because they believe in you and love you, you need to be convinced that they can afford to lose it all without major impact, and their emotion won't generate unreasonable expectations over time. If you are not sure on this matter, then don't take their money.  
 Be professional about it. Treat the transaction as you would expect to be treated by an Angel investor or VC. That means writing down and signing the terms of the agreement, after making sure everyone understands them. Insist on paying market rates for commercial loans, since the IRS can instigate some nasty consequences on ""gifts.""  
 Tie payments to your product or service revenue. Try to avoid obligations with fixed repayment schedules. With ""cash flow"" obligations, investors receive a percentage of your operating cash flow (if any) until they have been repaid in full, or have achieved a specified percentage return on their investment.  
 Loans are a safer option than equity. Offering debt is better than offering direct equity, especially in early stages when you have no valuation for setting equity percentages. Many use a convertible loan note that may be converted into equity upon the closing of the first formal Angel or VC round of financing, with a more realistic valuation.  
 Pay the money back, with thanks, as quickly as you can. This money is real, so don't assume it doesn't have to be repaid. Some founders are too focused on quick repayment, and they compromise strategic decisions. That's why it is better to use institutional investors and loans when you are able, with realistic time frame expectations.  
Don't forget a couple of additional potential negative realities. For entrepreneurs, friends and family money usually represents the smallest increment of funding, yet requires the most time to manage. Everyone wants to keep up and even have a say in your activities, and that can be a lot of conversations to manage. 
A second harsh reality for entrepreneurs is the realization of how little power you have to protect the position of these early investors. New money from professional investors sees lesser value in old money, so the equity of early investors is ""crammed down"" and often lost in the scale-up surge. Later investors all think you have given away too much of the company too soon.
These realities are part of the reason that this first tier of very early investors are often referred to as ""friends, family, and fools."" Most experienced entrepreneurs and investors can recount a horror story of families and friendships torn apart by money lost on someone else's dream. In these cases both the entrepreneur and the friends are the fools. Don't be one or create one.

102,BUSINESS,What About Good Debt Advice?,"Steve Rhode, Contributor
Consumer Debt Expert & Firefighter",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-about-good-debt-advi_us_5bb2f49ce4b0480ca65f7456,Debt relief companies are not in the advice business. They are in the widget selling business. Rather than independently,2013-05-11,BUSINESS,"For years there has been also sorts of chit-chat and discussion about how financial literacy will magical cure the woes and troubles of consumers and prevent them from getting into financial trouble. That's just simply wrong.
While financial education course may create more awareness on how to evaluate some financial products, that training is no good if it's not applied. And not everyone is going to be a good financial manager no matter how much training you give them.
It's not like we have an obesity problem in America because people don't know about eating well, portion control, and expertise. And it's not going to be tremendously different in the financial world if we trained everyone about interest rates, contract clauses, and fees.
Even recent work by the Consumer Financial Protection bureau is trying to work hard to dumb-down financial transactions so we can make some sense about getting a mortgage, credit card, or taking out a student loan.
But as one author noticed recently:
When consumers make poor financial decisions, they often do so because they lack information and understanding of product features. Financial literacy and sophistication is shockingly low: About one-third of the U.S. population understands the concepts of compound interest or how credit-card debt works. Such financial illiteracy is correlated with high levels of debt and high fees for financial services, and is greater among people with low incomes and low education, as well as minorities and the elderly.

I've never seen a study that shows the average debt literacy rate among the population. Debt literacy would be the skills, knowledge and experience to properly handle a debt emergency. While a third of the population might be considered to be grossly financially illiterate, I would estimate that close to 99 percent of debtors would be debt illiterate. 
Studying the issues surrounding debt is just not something people do in advance. instead, rather than become experts on how to get out of debt when they land in trouble they often believe or turn to the first person that gives them a magical solution they want to hear about.
The idea that paying for exceptional advice and an independent opinion from a debt coach is a smart thing to do seems foreign to people in trouble. Yet that professional and experienced advice is just what the doctor would order for a higher chance of a better result.
Debt relief companies are not in the advice business. They are in the widget selling business. Rather than independently evaluate your situation and provide fair, independent or balanced recommendations they most want to sell your their services and the ""consultation"" is really not more than a closing sales pitch.
And am I wrong about this. Well, let's consider some recent ads from some debt relief companies.
 Inside Sales -- Debt SettlementWe are looking for REAL. . . TRUE closers! PROS only need apply! Meaning, you can CLOSE!!!These are Inbound calls. . . HOWEVER. . .. These are NOT ""Lay-Downs"".

You will oversee the process of collecting all pertinent information for a complete contract, and your experience and judgment will allow you to plan and achieve individual sales targets. - Source 
Does anyone think the people that fill those positions will really have your best interest in mind when you are talking to them?
Or do you think their most important goal is to close the sale and fill their quota?
While the fields are full of closers and sellers for debt relief services, they are surprisingly absent of good independent debt coaches like Damon Day. Someone who can evaluate the situation of someone and guide them in the most logical direction based on their circumstances, needs and goals.
The difference is that talking to a debt coach costs money. You are paying for professional advice. But how much will a free sales pitch cost in time, money and lost time as you head down the wrong path to achieve the wrong goal, using the wrong tool?
A good debt coach is like a financial planner that charges you professional fees for advice instead of primarily making money on sales commissions of financial products. Wouldn't you rather work for someone that was working for you rather than just trying to close the sale? 
So if you are facing debt problems, I can't stress enough how important it is to seek and get good independent debt advice before you leap for a magical solution sold to you by a closer desperate to tell you the story you want to hear to meet their quota.

National Advocacy Director, Direct Care Alliance",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-new-face-of-our-economy_us_5bb305f9e4b0480ca661b27d,"Even if we put aside the moral argument for supporting direct care workers, it's in our national interest to better compensate and support these hardworking people who do so much to help the rest of us. The challenges confronting this workforce send shock waves throughout our economy.",2014-01-11,BUSINESS,"Fifty years into the war on poverty, it's time to focus on one of our fastest-growing workforces.
Fifty years ago this month, President Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty. At the time, the U.S. poverty rate was around 19 percent, and the president believed the government had a role to play in reducing that rate. 
The war on poverty continued beyond Johnson's tenure under both Democratic and Republican administrations, improving the lives of millions of American families by creating, expanding or strengthening crucial education, job training, health care, nutrition assistance and income support programs to construct our social safety net. But there is much still to do to stop rising inequality and reduce poverty -- and there's no better place to start than with direct care workers. 
Our nation's poverty rate is now 15 percent. That's lower than it was in LBJ's time, but it's still too high. In this unstable economy, our safety net is working overtime to help struggling individuals and families. Direct care workers like Elizabeth Castillo, a home care aide in El Paso, Texas, who makes less than $25,000 a year despite working two jobs, are falling further and further behind in this extended recession. 
Direct care workers -- the nursing assistants, home care and home health aides, personal care assistants, direct support professionals and others who provide the bulk of the paid, hands-on personal assistance and long-term care to older adults and people with disabilities -- are the face of our new service economy and one of our country's largest and fastest-growing occupations. Two subsets of that group, personal and home care workers, are the fastest-growing job categories in the nation. 
Even if we put aside the moral argument for supporting these hardworking people who do so much to help the rest of us, it's in our national interest to better compensate and support direct care workers. The challenges confronting this workforce send shock waves throughout our economy, as workers with low incomes spend less and often require taxpayer-funded assistance.
In other words, we can no longer afford to ignore the struggles of direct care workers. 
Poor Wages, Benefits and Opportunities for Advancement
Despite the essential care, services and support they provide to us, our families and our friends, direct care workers are cresting the trend of low-paying service jobs with poor benefits. 
For a start, they are among the most poorly compensated of all U.S. workers. Their median hourly wage was $10.63 in 2012, which was less than they earned 10 years earlier, after adjusting for inflation. It's no surprise, then, that almost half live in households that receive public benefits like Medicaid and food stamps, many of which stem from LBJ's war on poverty. 
These workers are also underserved by, or left out of, many other important programs and benefits. Many direct care workers, for instance, do not get paid sick leave. Many are not entitled to the unpaid leave mandated by the Family Medical Leave Act, and those who are generally cannot afford to take leave without pay. And until next January, when a long-awaited rule will finally go into effect, home care workers are not even guaranteed federal minimum wage or overtime pay.
Then there's health care. Direct care workers have higher-than-average rates of diabetes, asthma and other chronic conditions that become more serious when untreated. They also have one of the nation's highest rates of on-the-job injuries. And yet, they have much lower-than-average rates of health coverage. In 2011, less than half of all direct care workers had health coverage through an employer, and 30 percent of direct care workers had no health insurance at all, often because they could not afford the premiums and copays. 
Going without these benefits is obviously hard on direct care workers and their families -- and a bitter irony for workers who do so much to improve other people's health. It also has a strong ripple effect. Without paid sick leave, direct care workers often face a tough choice: Either stay home, thus losing wages that may make them unable to pay the bills, or go to work sick or injured, perhaps exposing consumers to the risk of infection or injury. Those with no insurance may wait until a health problem gets so bad that they must take a long absence from work, or get the kind of expensive intervention that can lead to serious debt or even bankruptcy, contributing to the ill health of the economy as a whole. 
Finally, there's the issue of advancement. Direct care workers do not receive enough recognition or compensation for their expertise and experience, and they have few ways to advance without leaving the profession. This lack of opportunity and respect is a main contributor -- along with poor wages and benefits -- to the high turnover rates that plague the industry. And high turnover among direct care workers is a problem for those who rely on them, costing consumers, families and other employers time and money as they hire and train new workers, and disrupting the continuity and reliability that is such an important part of quality care and support.
What We Can -- and Must -- Do
The best way to dramatically cut poverty rates is to ensure that the economy works for everyone -- starting with our fastest-growing workforces. That includes investing in quality jobs and strong programs that support families when they're struggling. 
Here are some current or proposed policy changes that would improve financial security and stability for direct care workers:
Wages:
Advocacy is needed to ensure that Congress does not derail the final home care rule that recently extended federal minimum wage and overtime protections to home care workers nationwide. Direct Care Alliance and our allies will also be helping the Department of Labor educate workers, consumers, and other employers about the rule to make sure it is implemented properly.  We must urge Congress to pass the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013, which will give low-paid workers an urgently needed raise and boost the consumer spending that drives the U.S. economy. We must urge Congress to enact immigration reform that creates a path to citizenship for undocumented direct care workers to reduce vulnerability to wage exploitation and abuse. (An estimated 20 to 24 percent of direct care workers are foreign-born, and many of them are undocumented.) 
Affordable health insurance and other benefits:
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) takes important steps to make health care affordable and accessible, but we need to ensure that it is implemented properly. After the Supreme Court ruled that states may opt out of expanding their Medicaid programs under the new law, about half of the 50 states chose not to do so, leaving millions of low-income people stranded without an affordable option. Medicaid expansion was also the foundation upon which many of ACA's other initiatives were built. We need to urge states whose leaders are currently on the fence or have decided against expansion to expand their Medicaid programs. The ACA is complicated, so most people need some assistance to understand their health care options under the new law and figure out how to get coverage. That help may come from individual navigators or from initiatives like Direct Care Alliance's Get Direct Care Workers Covered campaign, which is helping direct care workers and other low-income residents of New York state find the coverage that best fits their needs.  We must urge Congress to pass the Family and Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act, which would make paid family and medical leave available to nearly all of America's workers. We must also urge Congress to pass the Healthy Families Act, which will set a national paid sick days standard.
Safety net programs:
We must urge Congress to oppose cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, also known as food stamps), which offers nutrition assistance to more than 47 million low-income individuals, including many direct care workers and their families.
Career advancement within the profession:
We must create career ladders for direct care workers so that they can advance and earn more without leaving the profession. Direct Care Alliance's Personal Care and Support Credential, a competency-based test for personal assistance workers in home- and community-based settings, gives workers a way to demonstrate their skills. It also provides a way of tying increased pay and responsibility to measurable skills and competencies.
As we work to advance the goals of the war on poverty, improving the economic security of direct care workers and their families should be at the top of the list, because improving direct care workers' wages, benefits and career advancement opportunities will let us accomplish three important goals. We can help ensure a stable, qualified direct care workforce large enough to meet growing demand. We can transform one of our fastest-growing job categories so that it bolsters our middle class and strengthens our economy instead of swelling the ranks of the working poor. And we can deliver on the promise of a nation where hard work is rewarded and respected.

104,BUSINESS,U.S. Derivatives Regulations To Be Finalized,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-derivatives-reform-rules_us_5bb2c8eee4b0480ca65bff67,"WASHINGTON, July 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. swaps regulator is set to finalize this week a critical reform that will trigger",2012-07-08,BUSINESS,"By Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON, July 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. swaps regulator is set to finalize this week a critical reform that will trigger banks and traders having to comply with costly new derivatives rules.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission will vote on Tuesday on a definition of a ""swap,"" which will start a countdown on compliance dates for big swaps players to start registering with regulators and reporting their trades.
Market watchers say this is a big step in regulators' efforts to bring the $650 trillion over-the-counter swaps market out of the shadows.
Widespread ignorance of swaps exposure at failed investment firm Lehman Brothers and insurer American International Group aggravated the 2007-2009 financial crisis, which led to billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts.
The CFTC has struggled to keep pace with the rulemaking timetable laid out in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, and it has been criticized for moving ahead on rules that lay out requirements for swap dealers before even defining a swap.
The CFTC is expected to vote unanimously to finalize a swap definition that closely follows what is laid out in Dodd-Frank. Gabe Rosenberg, an attorney at Davis Polk, called it a ""critical moment for the industry.""
""Up to this point, potential swap dealers have had to guess when they will need to gear up and comply,"" he said. ""The task is massive.""
The toughest requirements will fall on those institutions labeled swap dealers, which are mostly banks with more than $8 billion in swap trades annually.
Major Wall Street firms and banks dominate the derivatives market and have been widely expected to be captured in the swap dealer category.
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America, Citigroup, HSBC and Goldman Sachs control 96 percent of cash and derivatives trading for commercial banks and trust companies as of Dec. 31, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
Swap dealers will be required to register with the CFTC two months after the final swap definition is published and will have to get their recordkeeping and reporting operations in place.
Top executives at swap dealing banks will have to be fingerprinted as part of the registration process.
Firms will also have to decide which legal entities should register as swaps dealers. Some banks may choose to shut down trading desks or shift trading to different offices to avoid registering in certain places.
Another key concern will be swaps data reporting. As of the compliance date, banks will have to begin reporting not just current trades but limited information about trades that took place before the rules were in place.
So far, the CFTC has only approved one swaps data warehouse - IntercontinentalExchange's ICE Trade Vault - to store the information, but more approvals are expected soon.
WIDENED CLEARING EXEMPTION
The CFTC on Tuesday will also broaden a key exemption that frees up certain end users from the requirement that they route their trades through independent clearinghouses. End users use swaps to hedge against risks like price fluctuations.
A clearinghouse creates a transparent trail for a trade and is backed by a default fund so that a transaction is completed even if one party to a deal goes bust.
The so-called ""end-user rule"" will be widened to exempt small banks, credit unions, and cooperatives with up to $10 billion in assets, sources told Reuters.
A spokesman for the CFTC was not available to comment.
Dodd-Frank directed the CFTC to consider exempting small banks at that threshold, but many banks had lobbied for higher asset levels such as $50 billion.
The CFTC will also vote to exempt all cooperatives from the clearing mandate, so long as the swaps are designed to hedge risk arising from loans or other financial interactions with their members, who must be ""end users.""
The exemptive order will capture about 12 cooperatives that would not have been exempted by the small bank exemption, a person familiar with the matter said.

105,BUSINESS,Focus On Micro Businesses For The Next 30 Years,"Sramana Mitra, ContributorFounder, One Million by One Million",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/focus-on-micro-businesses_b_13692182.html,,2016-12-17,BUSINESS,"
I have written several pieces under The Future series title:
- The Future - Genetic Engineering? - The Future - Destructive Technology Trends - The Future - End Of Capitalism - The Future - The Problem With Longevity - The Future - Technology Without Philosophy - The Future - The Most Important Entrepreneurial Challenge Of Our Time - The Future - Age Of Idiocracy
Now, if you agree with my prognosis that both blue collar and white collar jobs are going to disappear at a massive scale due to automation, then you must ask yourself, what is a constructive direction forward?
I have two answers to this question.
The first is a look at the next 30 years. The second is a longer term, beyond 30-year view. 
Inequality, Fortune at the Tip of the Pyramid: Today's Entrepreneurial Capitalism is driven by venture capital, which has an inherent tendency to create very large fortunes, but very few of them. How many Googles have you heard of? How many Facebooks? And thus, fortune accumulates in the hands of a few, very few people. In 2014, the top 1% of America's wealthy owned 40% of the nation's wealth. Fortune has been steadily accumulating at the tip of the economic pyramid.
Fortune in the Middle of the Pyramid: My observation, however, is that in Silicon Valley, we have learned a LOT about how to build successful businesses following the principles of Capitalism. If this knowledge can be broadly disseminated, and a much larger number of entrepreneurs start building successful businesses - doesn't have to be billion dollar businesses - can be million dollar businesses - that would drive fortune in the middle of the economic pyramid. And that is both possible today, and necessary today, given everything else that is going wrong in the global economic system.
Democratic, Distributed Capitalism: My vision for Capitalism in its next phase is a distributed, democratic capitalism whereby millions and millions of entrepreneurs build small and medium businesses that are profitable and sustainable in the long term. In other words, we need to create fortune in the middle of the pyramid.
Entrepreneurship Education, Incubation, Acceleration: So how is this possible to accomplish? The answer to this question is not finance. It is education. In fact, again, the entrepreneurship ecosystem is misreading the challenge and running after financing as the solution. I don't believe that. I believe entrepreneurship education is of paramount importance. And that is what will drive broad adoption of a Capitalistic system of value creation as well as wealth creation, although, more modest than the billionaire fortunes. No, we will not create a million billionaires and that kind of excess is not necessary.
Brexit: Greece Example: Just to give you an example, the morning after the Brexit vote, as Europe watched in horror, I spoke with a Greek entrepreneur who runs a $5M company called MarineTraffic. People are leaving Europe in droves right now. Europe is a fine example of the kind of disaster that Socialism creates. And yet, here, Demitris Memos had created a successful business from Athens that speaks to my vision: democratic, distributed capitalism. As of July 2016, youth unemployment rate in Greece stands at 50.3%. Spain is at 43.9%. Italy is at 39.2%. France is at 24.4%. It's a dreadful, tragic story of several lost generations. If Europe could mint a million entrepreneurs like Demitris, the continent could be saved.
1M/1M Vision: This is my work today. In 2010, I founded One Million by One Million - 1M/1M for short - the first global virtual accelerator in the world. Our mission is to help a million entrepreneurs reach a million dollars and beyond in annual revenue, build a trillion dollars in global GDP and 10 million jobs. We run this out of Silicon Valley but work with entrepreneurs all over the world.
What we do: The program is first and foremost an online educational program where you get to learn the nuances of technology entrepreneurship from over 700 successful entrepreneurs. We also do active mentoring, and make introductions to potential customers, channel partners, investors, media, analysts, etc.
Freshdesk example: One of the companies from the program, Freshdesk, has raised almost $150 million in venture capital and has some 40,000 customers around the world. The company was born in Chennai, but has moved headquarters to San Francisco recently. I am very proud of Freshdesk.
Siliguri example: I am, however, equally proud of a different type of entrepreneur that I have encountered through our work. You see, we do these free online mentoring sessions every week. One day, a first year college student from Siliguri, a small town in India in the foothills of the Himalayas, came to the mentoring roundtable and pitched an idea that he was working on. He wanted to use Uber-style GPS-enabled technology to power a small business delivery network in his regional market. I found it fascinating that this boy had come up with a decent concept, found 1M/1M, and was pitching this to me, half a world away. And this happens every week. We work with entrepreneurs from all corners of the world - not just India, but Africa, Asia, Latin America. And of course, US and Europe continue to be big markets for our work.
Optimistic in the next couple of decades: I do believe entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial capitalism can be democratized, and wealth can be created in the middle of the pyramid using capitalistic principles. In the next 2-3 decades, the potential for distributed capitalism is very high and the outcome should be extremely positive around the world.
Bootstrapping with a Paycheck: Now, the job loss due to automation has already started, as we speak. So, for those in large corporations, I have a simple word of wisdom: start a small side business while you still have a job. Bootstrap your startup with your paycheck. This way, if the axe falls, you have a fallback position.
Older Engineers: Layoffs, please note, tend to skew older. The white-collar job loss that is coming will impact older engineers (and older workers in general) much more severely. Start preparing now, while you still have a job, and line up your ducks. You will need to build a micro business of your own.
Beyond 30 years: In the 30-50 year timeframe and beyond, technology and automation will create tremendous disruption. 60-80% of ALL jobs will, likely, get automated. At that point, Capitalism fails, and the only solution would be Universal Basic Income.

According to Jim Brown with the Long",2012-11-03,BUSINESS,"STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- At a time when public approval of labor unions is near an all-time low, union workers are charged with much of the dirty and dangerous work of cleaning up after Hurricane Sandy. Here, along one the hardest-hit stretches of New York waterfront, union workers fixed Internet connections, disconnected gas pipes to prevent explosions and patrolled the streets in cop cars and ambulances.   In other the storm-devastated regions of New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut, union workers are repairing and clearing roads and bridges, restoring phone service, turning the lights back on, getting the subway lines back on track, repairing homes, operating hotels where families are taking refuge from their flooded neighborhoods, and nursing injured survivors back to health. And that's to say nothing of the unionized police officers and firefighters who, as in Staten Island, seem to be stationed on every corner in zones with heavy damage.  ""Once again, we’re seeing how the working people of America pull together when things get hard and their efforts save lives,"" said Vincent Alvarez, president of the New York City Central Labor Council. 
According to a Gallup Poll from August 2012, (http://www.gallup.com/poll/157025/labor-union-approval-steady.aspx) 52 percent of Americans approve labor unions, a rate up only slightly from the all-time low of 48 percent in 2009. The wave of anti-union sentiment of the last few years has arguably had significant political consequences, most notably the arrival of the Tea Party class of Republicans in Congress two years ago and the anti-union efforts championed by the likes of Gov. Scott Walker (R) in Wisconsin and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).  Those developments raised big questions concerning the labor force: Should workers have collective bargaining rights and paid vacation days? Do unions bolster the economy or weaken it? On Friday, people in the flood-ravaged areas seemed unconcerned about those questions. ""We'd welcome anyone,"" said James Gafney, 32, standing outside his debris-strewn Staten Island home.  Larry Lutz, a steamfitter with Local 638 on Staten Island, was among the union workers helping the cleanup in Midland Beach, a devastated neighborhood in Staten Island. He couldn't go to his actual job on Friday -- his construction site was still underwater -- so he decided to help friends in the neighborhood where he grew up, hauling trash and damaged belongings out of basements and ground-floor apartments. ""To me this is a catastrophe, and there should be more manpower,"" he said.  Candice Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Communication Workers of America, said unionized technicians at Verizon, AT&T, and Cablevision are working 12 hours a day, seven days a week, to restore service. The union also represents 60,000 public workers in New Jersey who are cleaning and repairing bridges and roads and taking 911 calls, she said.  In Connecticut, AT&T crews were dispatched with disaster equipment as Hurricane Sandy neared so that workers could respond quickly, Johnson added.  Union volunteers have played a big role in clearing the downed trees in eastern Queens, according to Sally Frank, campaign manager for Nily Rozic, a community leader running for state legislature. Volunteers from Local 79 and Local 1010 of the Laborers contacted Rozic shortly after the storm, Frank said, and arrived with ""good spirits and saws and got to work immediately.""
Many union workers are among the hardest-hit by the storm, but still worked long days. According to Jim Brown with the Long Island local International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union, his members ""left their families, many with flooded and damaged homes, and came to work, some before before the storm hit, and have remained there working 16-hour shifts. That has left them with only eight hours to travel home, rest, cope with their own situations, and return to work again."" 
School was still cancelled on Friday, but Arthur Nallario, 37, and his colleagues -- teachers at a Staten Island high school and members of the United Federation Of Teachers -- were doing what they could around the battered borough.

Her team focuses on leveraging mobile technology to deliver compelling patient engagement and medication adherence solutions for pharmacies. Fiona is passionate about creating mobile solutions that will improve patient outcomes, keep patients healthy and address the global issue of medication non-adherence.
Prior to mscripts, Fiona held several management positions with start-ups and global enterprises, including Amazon.com and Informix Software. Fiona holds a BA in Comparative Literature from Williams College and has done graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley.
How has your life experience made you the leader you are today? I grew up as an ex-pat kid in Panama. My dad was an English biologist doing research for the Smithsonian and my family was very intellectual. At the same time, I went to school with American military kids and was immersed in Latin American culture. Because we were living overseas, my parents sent me away to boarding school in Massachusetts, where I was again, pretty different from the kids I met there. While it was really hard to leave home when I was 14, having to figure things out for myself at that age made me very resilient and gave me a lot of self-confidence. I think the experience of being different; both culturally and ethnically, also gave me a real appreciation of the potential that comes from cultural diversity, but also an appreciation for diversity of thought. Today, if you look at my team at work, I've got someone who's very literary, an architect who moved over to do UX work, woman who started out as a mechanical engineer, and a software engineer. . We're focused on helping people manage their medications to keep themselves healthy, tackling the new field of mobile health in new and creative ways. We many different constituents, of varying ages, and with a varying exposure to technology (a fifth of our user base is over 50.) With that in mind, our apps are available in both English and Spanish, we've worked with the American Foundation for the Blind to make sure it's highly accessible, and we use a lot of help tips to ensure that users understand how features work. We saw that many of our users were asking to manage medications on behalf of their family, so we introduced family accounts. Today, an astounding 80% of those family accounts are managed by women. 
How has your previous employment experience aided your tenure at mscripts? I think there have been two jobs that have really helped me. I worked at a startup that was bought by Amazon.com, and when I went there, I really got a crash course in consumer marketing and customer service. At Christmas time we'd work all day, and then we would all go and pack books at the warehouse until 2 or 3 in the morning. That singular focus on making the customer happy is something I think is the hallmark of a great business, and we emulate that at mscripts. We work very closely with our pharmacies to gather requirements for new product features, and we spend a lot of time understanding what their customers are looking for. The other job was teaching an entry-level English class as a graduate student at UC Berkeley, which taught me to bring both an analytic and an empathetic lens to coaching and providing feedback. When you are trying to teach someone how to write, you have to be very precise and very logic-driven, but you also have to understand how painful the process of taking feedback on something you've worked incredibly hard on can be. I try to bring that to my work at mscripts, encouraging attention to detail, improvement through iteration, and working outside of your comfort zone in order to expand it.
What have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at mscripts? They are really two sides of the same coin. Growing from a very small to a medium-size start-up was very challenging and also incredibly rewarding. You have to build process and increasingly specialize as you go from 4 people to 70, and that can sometimes be really hard, when you're taking an employee who has previously been responsible for four or five areas in the company and asking them to focus more and more on one. Likewise, it's hard to impose process where it hasn't existed in the past.
What advice can you offer to women who want to start their own business? 1) Have confidence that you can be the boss. I was having lunch with a friend of mine recently who had a great idea for a company in the health tech space, and she kept talking about finding a CEO to run her company. I finally asked her why she felt she had to bring someone else in to run it. She's a smart, competent, experienced professional, and yet she didn't feel somehow that she could be the top person. This doesn't seem to be an anxiety that men cope with, at least not to the same extent. 2) If you, like my friend, feel you lack an area of expertise that's preventing you from succeeding, hire someone to work for you who can fill that gap. Don't feel you have to be able to do it all. 3) Work with people you like and trust.
What is the most important lesson you've learned in your career to date? How be a 'maker', how to hire other 'makers', and how to create an environment that fosters creative work. It's really difficult to start a project from scratch and carry it through to completion. Of course, when you are building your own company and creating something completely new you have to do this on an on-going basis, and everyone on your team has to be able to do it too. At mscripts, we often talk about makers and consumers. In a lot of large and medium-sized companies it's easy to become a consumer of pre-packaged work, but if you want to be successful in a small company, you constantly have to build things yourself. Things I do with my team to support this: I give them ambitious but achievable goals and help them set a timeline; I meet with them at least once a week, and often multiple times a day, to check in on their progress; I encourage brainstorming and team cross-pollination; I try to make it ok to fail, because failure should be a waystation on the way to success, not an ignominious end point. 
How do you maintain a work/life balance? I wish I were better at this! My husband and I work together right now, which simultaneously makes it easier and harder for me. On the one hand, I get to commute to and from work with him, and I see him throughout the day. On the other hand, it's really hard for us to turn off work when we're home. I am obsessive about work, so over the years I've decided I can focus on two main areas in my life well, or try to do more, but poorly. So besides work, my main focus right now is on time with my kids. I put aside two or three hours at the end of the day to do homework with my girls. I insist that we always have dinner as a family. I read to my younger daughter before bed, and I make time to do things with my older daughter that she loves, like walking our dogs or dancing in the kitchen. We ski together during the winter, which is great family time, because they are awesome skiers.  What do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace? I started working in the valley in 1992, and my experience then was very different from what is being reported on today. I had a great experience of working mostly with nerdy men, and I mean that in the most complimentary way, who were interested in creating new ways of living through technology, whether that was the power of unlocking data or new ways of conducting commerce. I found it a fairly egalitarian environment if you were smart and hard working. However, I've been saddened by the recent press around sexism in Silicon Valley. The challenges that young women are facing now include the same old issues that we've always faced, like glass ceilings or having access to childcare or family leave, but also new issues like getting funding bias and outright harassment at work. As this new wave of highly accomplished young women are coming out of college they are moving into an environment which is weirdly anachronistic in its aggressive behavior towards their aspirations and who they are. I am encouraged that many of them are speaking out on the topic, and I hope they are able to take that experience and turn it into something positive.
How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life? When I was just starting out I had a great female mentor who gave me my first real break, letting me manage the Latin American marketing department for a large software company, a position which was a real stretch for me. Now that I'm more experienced, I find that mentoring others is incredibly rewarding and I enjoy every opportunity I get to encourage other women. If I had one recommendation to young women it would be to actively seek mentorship. If there's not a person in your network who can provide that for you, go out and find someone experienced to help you. People love to give advice. When we were just getting started at mscripts we brought in a great advisor, Ken Ross, who helped us strategize on how to transition from a start-up to a mid-sized company. His ability to mentor us based on his past experiences was invaluable to me individually, and mscripts as a company.
Which other female leaders do you admire and why? There are women I admire in the abstract, like Judy Faulkner at Epic, because they've built large companies, they are tough and smart, and they've succeeded in a competitive marketplace, but I am really lucky to have lots of friends who are women who, like me, have gone back to work after having kids, and done something risky - they've started their own small companies and built new marketplaces. So Mariam Naficy at Minted, who has changed the way we think about and buy holiday cards, stationery and art, Anna Brockway at Chairish, who is changing the way we buy and sell used furniture, and Maryam Mohit at Gemshare (and now Nextdoor), who is changing the way we recommend services to friends, are all women who I deeply respect and admire. They've all started their own companies, balancing work and family, and are really dedicated and passionate about what they do.
What do you want mscripts to accomplish in the next year? We are partnering with our pharmacies to help patients get access to and understand their medications, and to take them as directed. Around half of U.S. patients with chronic conditions don't take the medications they need to address their condition, and that has serious consequences. Medication non-adherence leads to 125,000 deaths annually and contributes to about 10% of hospital readmissions. It has also been estimated to contribute to between $100 and 150 billion in annual costs to our health care system. We are working with our network of pharmacies to deliver educational resources, coupons, reminders, and lifestyle support directly to people's phones. At the same time, we're using surveys and the data that we gather to understand non-adherence better. So our goals are ambitious - we hope to have a measurable positive impact on the health of our customers, and to provide them with a convenient and easy way to manage their health.

110,BUSINESS,Obstacles for Women Reaching the Top: Unconscious Images,"Caroline Turner, ContributorAuthor, workshop facilitator, speaker, consultant",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obstacles-for-women-reach_b_5484743.html,"If tooting your own horn is hard for you (a common thing among women), PRACTICE. Or ask a colleague or sponsor to ""toot"" on your behalf (and do that for others).",2014-06-13,BUSINESS," 
In exploring reasons why women are still not proportionately represented at the leadership levels of American business, we get down to what McKinsey & Co. calls invisible ""mind-sets."" These mind-sets give rise to obstacles - for women and gender diversity. One such obstacle is what I call ""unconscious images."" Like the other mind-sets (the double bind and the comfort principle), this cause is neither malicious nor intentional. Consciousness of its existence, and its impact in the workplace, can lead to inclusive behaviors and cultures.
Anyone who has been alive at least nine months has ""pictures"" of how certain things look. For example, if I ask you to picture a CEO (close your eyes and do that), chances are you will not have an image of a short, plump, woman of color. Most people will imagine, in fact, a lean white male -- because that is what we most commonly see. And he will be tall. One study says that the average Fortune 500 CEO is over 6 feet tall, 2-3 inches taller than the average man!
If business leaders share this ""tall white male"" image of power and success, but are unconscious of it, there are advantages for people who fit this image. If someone ""looks the part,"" he may be more likely to get to try out for the role. When thinking about whom to consider for an important project or promotion, someone who ""looks the part"" is more likely to come to mind than someone who does not. 
This is about more than appearance. Styles of leadership either do or do not fit the historical image, which includes ""leading from the front."" Someone who leads collaboratively may be seen as lacking leadership, despite great team results. A talented person who does not ""look the part,"" is more likely to be overlooked. There may be more focus on how this person acts than on actual contributions. The boss cannot imagine this person at the next level. 
I do not believe we can eradicate our unconscious images. The goal is to make leaders aware of them so they can monitor their impact and make more enlightened (and inclusive) choices in making assignments and promotions. Think about this very human phenomenon as a blind spot. You are aware of the blind spot in your car. Before changing lanes, you compensate for the blind spot. If you are aware that you have pictures of how leadership or success ""looks,"" you can push the ""pause button"" on your automatic thinking. Do this when you feel judgment about someone or when you are doing performance evaluations or considering making a promotion. Are you NOT seeing a person's results or contributions because he or she does not ""look the part""? When filling a job or team, are you NOT thinking of someone who could do a great job but does not fit the usual image?
What can women and others affected by unconscious images do? If your style of dress or hairstyle is very different from the norm in your organization, consider whether you might make some changes. (Conforming a little in appearance need not mean giving up your authentic style.) Take it on yourself to be sure your boss (or person evaluating you or handing out good work) knows about your skills and your results. Acknowledge that your approach may be different but show how it has worked well. If tooting your own horn is hard for you (a common thing among women), PRACTICE. Or ask a colleague or sponsor to ""toot"" on your behalf (and do that for others). 
What you have done to make sure you do not make choices based on who fits your unconscious images? What have you done to minimize the negative effects of unconscious images on you and others?

* Case shows patchwork nature of state regulations on compounders
* Idaho says unclear if NECC acted as manufacturer or wholesaler
By David Bailey
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct 13 (Reuters) - U.S. states are stepping up scrutiny of the company at the center of a deadly meningitis scare, with two states accusing it of violating licensing rules and several others starting investigations of its activities, according to a Reuters survey of states affected.
Michigan, with the second largest number of meningitis cases, and Massachusetts, where the New England Compounding Center is located, have been the most aggressive, saying they believe NECC violated their regulations.
""(NECC's) pharmacy license did not allow it to ship large quantities for general use,"" Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said on Friday as the state suspended the company's license and opened an investigation.
If found guilty of violating the Michigan public health code, officials of NECC, which produced the tainted steroid linked to the scandal, could face a prison sentence, the attorney general's complaint said.
Several other states including Indiana, Minnesota and Ohio have launched investigations of the company. Still others, including New Hampshire and the hardest hit state of Tennessee, have scheduled administrative hearings on possible violations.
""It was New England Compounding Pharmacy's intent to conform to the rules of any state in which it sold its products to medical providers,"" a spokesman for the company said on Saturday in an emailed statement.
The meningitis outbreak, which had killed 15 people as of Saturday, has highlighted the patchwork nature of state regulations and licensing requirements and a lack of federal oversight of compounding pharmacies such as NECC. [ID: nL1E8LD2UY]
Compounding pharmacies produce special order medications for clinics and doctors but are not supposed to operate as pharmaceuticals manufacturers and ship drugs in bulk. 
201 MENINGITIS CASES
Authorities have said up to 14,000 people could have received injections from the suspect medication shipped to 23 states by the Framingham, Massachusetts-based company. As of Saturday, 201 people were reported with meningitis in 14 states, the CDC and state officials in New Hampshire said.
A separate Reuters investigation found that NECC failed to require proof of individual patient prescriptions as required by Massachusetts regulations, and solicited bulk orders from physicians, according to emails to a customer.
Reuters reviewed more than a dozen emails that show NECC supplied one customer in Mississippi with drugs without patient names or prescriptions.
On Thursday, the Massachusetts attorney general said it was investigating NECC to determine what led to the distribution of the suspect steroids and to determine any potential legal action.
""This organization chose to apparently violate the licensing requirements under which they were allowed to operate,"" said Madeleine Biondolillo, director of the Bureau of Health Care and Safety at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
In Idaho, NECC is licensed to supply drugs for specific prescriptions as an out-of-state mail order pharmacy and it was unclear if it acted as a wholesaler or manufacturer, said Jan Atkinson, senior compliance officer at the state pharmacy board.
Idaho facilities received some of the potentially tainted steroid medication typically injected to alleviate back pain and had reported one case of meningitis as of Saturday.
Cori Anderson, spokeswoman for Pain Specialists in Idaho Falls, said the clinic received about 40 vials of the suspect medication directly from NECC and not directed at a patient.
But laws are not consistent from state to state. Idaho law allows retail pharmacies, including mail-order pharmacies, to sell ""minimal quantities"" of prescription drugs to licensed practitioners for office use in a provision meant for covering short-term shortages, Atkinson said.
The pharmacy board determines if shipments constitute ""minimal quantities"" on an individual basis, Atkinson said.
""This may be a new area we need to address,"" she said. 
LICENSE SURRENDER?
Tennessee, the state where patients first reported being sickened after the injections, said its pharmacy board will consider a request for NECC to surrender its license on Monday.
Indiana's pharmacy board has turned an investigation over to the state attorney general, director Greg Pachmayr said. NECC was licensed to fill specific prescriptions in Indiana, which had reported two deaths among 27 people sickened as of Saturday.
In Minnesota, the company is licensed to fill prescriptions for a specific patient and would need to be licensed as a wholesaler and a manufacturer to sell drugs in bulk, said Cody Wiberg, executive director of the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy.
""You can't buy it in bulk from a pharmacy and then as you use it, write out a prescription for the patient and mail that back to the pharmacy,"" Wiberg said.
Minnesota had reported four meningitis cases as of Saturday.
Other states have ordered NECC to halt distributions, a moot point with the company voluntarily suspending operations. Virginia, North Carolina and Ohio suspended its license, while California ordered NECC distributions halted.
The suspect drugs were administered to about 430 patients in Ohio and the state is investigating whether NECC broke any rules. It was registered as an out-of-state wholesaler but compounded drugs could only be ordered for specific patients.
""We want to make sure they didn't make large batches of the drug and then ship them,"" Ohio pharmacy board spokesman Jesse Wimberly said.

113,BUSINESS,5 Keys to Product Differentiation for Fun and Profit,"Marty Zwilling, ContributorVeteran Start-up Mentor; Executive",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-keys-to-product-differe_b_5538524.html,,2014-06-27,BUSINESS,"Every entrepreneur believes that their product or service is different, and that every customer will quickly see the advantage over competitors. Yet true product differentiation in the eye of the customer is rarely achieved. According to a survey by Bain & Company a while back, 80 percent of businesses believe they have differentiated offerings, but only 8 percent of customers agree.
To highlight the impact of being perceived as differentiated, other experts project that businesses with truly differentiated offerings have an 80 percent chance of long-term success, whereas companies with 'me-too' customer perceptions have only a 20 percent chance. Differentiation is a key requirement for a successful startup rollout, and must be sustainable to keep ahead of new competition.
Since I'm a fan of real-world feedback, I was intrigued by the insights on differentiation in a new book, Roadside MBA: Back Road Lessons for Entrepreneurs, Executives, and Small Business Owners, by Michael Mazzeo, Paul Oyer, and Scott Schaefer. As well as having great academic credentials, these guys recently traversed the USA getting lessons from real small businesses.
Here are a few of their conclusions relative to product differentiation, supplemented by my own recommendations from experience and other experts:
Work on perceptions, as well as reality. It doesn't do you any good to be different, if your customers can't perceive the difference, or you don't tell anyone about it. The days are gone for the ""if we build it, they will come"" mentality. Marketing and target customer relationships are always required, no matter how obvious the differentiation is to you.
 Of course, working on perception can backfire if the differentiation reality isn't there. Remember the old saying, ""You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still going to be a pig."" Like a damaged reputation, a discredited differentiation is extremely difficult to turn positive. 
Quantify the difference for your customers. Use numbers to make your offering the clear alternative. Fuzzy marketing terms like easier to use, lower cost, and higher quality are not effective differentiators, since they have been overused to the point of having no meaning. 
 Real data and customer testimonials say it best, such as get it done in half the time, or half the cost, or comes with a 5-year warranty. In my experience, numbers less than 20 percent are not enough, since small numbers are not likely to overcome the inertia and learning curve required of most customers. 
Focus on customers you really care about, and who care about you. Trying to be all things to all people never works. Identify your target customer segment before you finalize your differentiation. For example, customers with high disposable income will likely respond better to unique features, rather than a lower cost. 
 One business visited on the road had successfully implemented a product-differentiation strategy to appeal to the 20 percent of their clients who were the most profitable, and discourage the 80 percent who were more costly. They noted that customers' loyalty grew with their real preference for the unique product features offered. 
Customize to differentiate, but do it efficiently. The new generation of customers expect to get what they want, when they want it, customized to their taste. So customization is an important differentiation strategy, but be sure to strike a balance between the revenue potential of the effort, versus the costs required to execute. 
 We have moved from the era of mass customization to collaborative customization. Today, differentiated companies enable customers to determine the precise product offering that best serves that customer's needs. For example, MakeYourOwnJeans encourages customers to tailor-make jeans dynamically per their specifications. 
Define a unique selling proposition (USP), and keep it simple. Complex or highly technical selling propositions are not good differentiators, since they will likely not grab people' attention or be remembered by most customers. A good example is Dominos Pizza ""We'll deliver in 30 minutes or less, or it's free!"" 
Successful product differentiation requires a conscious and continuous effort, including listening on the right social media channels, being consistently helpful to your customers, and continuous innovation. But the results can put you in that coveted 8 percent that customers remember for real fun and profit. Isn't that why you signed on to the entrepreneur lifestyle in the first place?

114,BUSINESS,Is The Federal Reserve Printing A Free Lunch?,"Terry Burnham, Ph.D. , ContributorFinance professor, Chapman University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-the-federal-reserve-pr_b_5837404.html,"I continue to believe that this grand Keynesian experiment will end in tears. Furthermore, when it ends badly, future generations will not be able to believe our stupidity.",2014-09-17,BUSINESS,"""US set for lowest budget deficit since 2008"" reads a recent CBS headline.
This year's U.S. budget deficit is estimated to be $506 billion. While this is a large amount in absolute terms it is much smaller than deficits in recent years. This relative dearth of red ink has led Paul Krugman to crow, ""Bad news for Dr. Evil fans: the days of a ONE TRILLION DOLLAR deficit are over. In fact, the deficit is falling fast.""
However, much of the improvement in the U.S. budget deficit was caused by Federal Reserve policies of quantitative easing and low interest rates. If the budget deficit is low because of monetary manipulations, is the improvement real and sustainable?
""If the budget deficit is low because of monetary manipulations, is the improvement real and sustainable?""
One way the Fed could decrease the budget deficit would be by adding jobs and having those newly employed people stop receiving government support and start paying taxes. But even if Federal Reserve policies did not create a single job, the central bank may still have cut this year's budget deficit almost in half. More on that calculation in a moment.
If the Federal Reserve did dramatically decrease the budget deficit, is it a free lunch? ""There's No Such Thing as a Free Lunch"" is a conceptual cornerstone of economics, with Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman writing a book of the same title. Professor Friedman died in 2006, but YouTube has an almost hour-long talk of his arguing against the existence of free lunches.
So who is right, Janet Yellen or Milton Friedman?
Let us consider the possibility of a monetary free lunch in two parts. First, how did the Fed decrease the U.S. budget deficit so dramatically? And, second, is the Fed really serving up a free lunch?
Let us begin by investigating how the Fed has dramatically cut the U.S. budget deficit. Fed policies, independent of employment effects, reduce the deficit in two ways.
First, the Fed now owns trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds. The interest paid on those bonds is sent from the U.S. Treasury to the Fed, and then the Fed sends them back to the Treasury. The Fed also owns trillions in mortgage bonds and some of the interest on those bonds is sent to the Treasury too.
Second, the government may be paying a lot less in interest because of Fed policies. Indeed, quantitative easing is designed to lower interest rates. The stated goal of the Fed's efforts to keep rates low is to help private sector borrowers, such as home buyers who want mortgages. Low mortgage rates lead to high home prices, which lead to more new homes built, which finally, leads to more jobs for people who build homes.
However, low rates help all borrowers reduce their interest payments, and the U.S. Treasury is by far the largest borrower in America.
Let us measure the impact of these two channels. Last year, the Fed sent $77.7 billion back to the Treasury. The Fed spent about $4 billion dollars on salaries, facilities and other expenses. Against these costs, the Fed ""earned"" about $82 billion. The $82 billion is interest on the bonds that the Fed has purchased by quantitative easing. (To paraphrase pop music, ""Get your money for nothing and your checks for free."")
This year the Fed will likely send even more money to the Treasury because the Fed's bond pile is much larger than it was a year ago. Furthermore, while interest rates are still low, they have risen about one percentage point from their 2012 lows. Thus, this year the Fed will earn more interest on its swelling quantitative-easing treasure trove than last year.
If the Fed sends $90 billion to the Treasury this year, it will be $53 billion more than the Fed sent in 2007; the last year before it began quantitative easing. So, let us count $53 billion in extra money sent by the Fed to the Treasury because of quantitative easing.
The second, and much larger, reason that the Fed has cut the budget deficit is low interest rates. In 2007, the U.S. government had a total of $4.8 trillion dollars of debt in the hands of the public. On this $4.8 trillion in debt, the U.S. government paid an average interest rate of 4.9 percent for a total of $237.1 billion in interest payments.
Because of enormous budget deficits, the amount of U.S. government debt in public hands has now risen to $11.9 trillion. However, interest rates are much lower now than they were in 2007. In spite of nearly tripling its debt, the U.S. government is paying less interest now than it did in 2007. If the government instead had to pay the same 4.9 percent rate as it did in 2007, the interest cost would have been $356 billion higher this year.

Without the Fed's unusual policies, Dr. Evil fans would still be taunting Paul Krugman instead of vice versa.
Did the Fed really reduce the budget deficit by $409 billion?
A precise calculation requires knowing what interest rates would have been without Fed intervention. Perhaps the $409 billion overstates the impact of Fed policies because interest rates are low all over the world now. If the U.S. would have paid less than a 4.9 percent interest rate even without Fed policies, the $409 billion figure overstates the impact.
On the other hand, perhaps the impact of Fed policy is even more than $409 billion. In a previous post, I noted that the government is on an historic ""spending spree that has increased total government debt by almost $10 trillion in a decade -- more in the last decade than in the entire prior history of the U.S."" Without quantitative easing, perhaps interest rates would have been higher than 4.9 percent to induce extra buyers to own all these extra government bonds.
Even if we cannot know for sure what interest rates would be without unusual Fed policies, we can observe that the current 10-year Treasury yield of 2.6 percent is very low. One reason for these low rates might be the Fed purchases under quantitative easing.
The magnitude of quantitative easing is staggering. In fact, the Fed has monetized 40 percent of the cumulative new issuance of federal debt since 2007. ""Monetized"" means that the Fed has created new money by waving its electronic wand, and used that new money to buy Treasury and mortgage bonds.
Since 2007, the Federal government has issued $8.7 trillion in additional debt and the Fed has monetized an additional $3.5 trillion by creating new money.
In the last two years, the Fed has monetized 96 percent of new U.S. debt. Over the last two years, the government has increased debt by $1.68 trillion and the Fed has created $1.62 trillion in new money.

Now consider that the Fed may actually have a positive impact on the economy beyond financial engineering and financial repression. Perhaps the Fed is actually responsible for some of the jobs that have been created since 2007. Under this decidedly non-Austrian view, the Fed creates money, it uses that money to buy U.S. government debt, and monetary policy provides the lubrication for stimulative fiscal policy as well.
So here is the potential free lunch. The government overspends by trillions and the Fed pays for the expenditures with newly created money. Actually, the lunch is better than free, as it saved the U.S. government more than $400 billion this year alone.
This raises two questions. First, if the lunch is free, why close the restaurant? Second, can the road to non-serfdom really be paved with electronic dollars?
The Fed is planning to end additional new purchases of bonds at its October 2014 meeting -- just next month. Why end the free lunch?
""The beauty of creating money for nothing is there is no limit to how much the Fed can create.""
Rather, why not increase the scale of quantitative easing by, for example, monetizing the remaining $11.9 trillion of public U.S. debt. In fact, why stop there, why not buy up all the U.S. government debt and some trillions of other assets -- stocks, private bonds, real estate and more. With an even larger investment pile, the Fed could send hundreds of billions of dollars in proceeds every year to the U.S. government. The beauty of creating money for nothing is there is no limit to how much the Fed can create.
But one reason not to monetize on a larger scale might be that there would be costs to greater monetization. Perhaps like goldilocks and Arthur Laffer in his eponymous tax curve, the Fed has found the optimal amount of monetary creation. Yes, $4 trillion is great, but an extra $12 trillion to remove all federal debt would be too much.
And yet, the proponents of current Fed policies mention no large costs to monetization, so one wonders why they would stop now.
It comes down to whether the monetization lunch is actually free. Are there hidden costs in the economy today, or, alternatively, will the economy crash in the future because of these Fed actions?
The uncomfortable truth is that no one knows the total impact of current Fed policies. The tax-and-spend policies of the 1970s have been repudiated; Instead, we are running a giant print-and-spend experiment with our lives, and those of our children and grandchildren.
""There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.""
While no one knows what will happen, I think Milton Friedman is right. There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.
Therefore, I continue to believe that this grand Keynesian experiment will end in tears. Furthermore, when it ends badly, future generations will not be able to believe our stupidity. They will ask, ""So your plan to solve the problem of overspending and too much debt was to have the Fed create a lot of money to enable much greater amounts of overspending and debt accumulation? Who was running the asylum, the evil doctors or the patients?""

115,BUSINESS,The Essential Guide to Preparing to Franchise Your Business,"Bob Steinberger, ContributorBusiness lawyer, franchise owner and entrepreneur. I am dedica...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-essential-guide-to-pr_b_5672760.html,"While franchising isn't an easy task, the truth remains that when you combine a strong business model, a well thought out and strategically planned foundation and the patience to set up your franchise properly, the end product will be life-changing.",2014-08-14,BUSINESS,"Franchising isn't an overnight process. 
Most good things never are. But while franchising isn't an easy task, the truth remains that when you combine a strong business model, a well thought out and strategically planned foundation and the patience to set up your franchise properly, the end product will be life-changing. 
Depending on what stage your business is at today, franchising can take anywhere from three months to several years. No matter where you are on that timeline, it's important to lay the groundwork now, taking steps to strengthen your ability to franchise faster when your business is ready. 
Here is a blueprint for what steps you will need to take before franchising your business, so you can start preparing now. 
Trademark
One of the few time frames you can't control, the process of acquiring a trademark can take 8-12 months. This is a great starting point for businesses thinking about franchising. The process of applying isn't as time intensive as the approval process, so I always encourage business owners to apply as soon as they decide to franchise. 
There are four types of trademarks, but the most used ones (as defined by the U.S. Patent Office) are: 
Trademarks -- used by their owners to identify goods, that is, physical commodities, which may be natural, manufactured, or produced, and which are sold or otherwise transported or distributed via interstate commerce.
Service Marks -- used by their owners to identify services, that is, intangible activities, which are performed by one person for the benefit of a person or persons other than himself, either for pay or otherwise. 
The other more uncommon ones are Certification Marks and Collective Marks. Depending on your business, you may need more than one. Completing this process early gives you the freedom to launch your franchise when your business is ready, not when the patent office finally gives their blessing.
Trade Dress
Your trade dress covers a wide scope of your business. Think of it as the core branding of your business. While it's important to explore all aspects of your trade dress, what you will need to nail down are tangibles needed and upfront costs. Finer nuances, such as greetings and packaging, can be finalized later. Start with the most expensive, or biggest items, and work your way down. 
What type of space is needed to operate the business?  What equipment is needed (customized kitchen equipment, vehicles, specialized stations, etc.)  What are prospective costs for insurances?  What items are needed to operate (furniture, phone systems, computers, etc.) 
Outline the start up costs to open your business from scratch. What a potential franchisee will need to know is how much it will cost to open his or her business doors. While you cannot know exact costs, supply an accurate range. For example, my video gaming company has a start up range of $100,000-$148,000. 
If you don't want to franchise with your current trade dress, start envisioning what that trade dress will be. It is not uncommon for businesses to change their trade dress before franchising. Some businesses open another location as a prototype to test it out. 
Prove the System  You know that your business works, but it will be critical as you begin recruiting franchisees to showcase to them that it works and that it will be easy for them to be successful. 
This is where you will need to have your financials in order. Franchisees will want to see a strong record of performance for your business. It can also be important to have a compelling personal track record with no bankruptcies or previous business failures. You want to instill as much confidence as possible in potential franchisees.
In addition to financials it will be helpful to understand the nuances of your business model and to help enable franchisees to make the proper decisions around certain types of locations, seasonal factors and/or proximity to other similar businesses. 
Operations Manual
This is your secret sauce. From A-Z how your businesses operates successfully every day. This comprehensive guide on proven techniques running your business is why people buy into a franchise. Using your proven platform, they strengthen their chances for success. 
This tell-all document is a proprietary product, meaning you legally own the material. Within the franchise, only key upper management will see this document. So rest easy and divulge all your trade secrets. Remember the more successful your franchisees are, the more profitable your franchise will become.
While no operations manual is the same, yours should include things like:
Management: Position Descriptions, Hiring, Training, Firing Operations: Opening, Closing, Using Point of Sales, Reports, Day-to-Day Tasks Customer Service Expectations Marketing  Technology: Key Software, Equipment, Point of Sales Systems Managing Capital: How to do the Books, Ordering Products, Payroll
Plan on several months to write a quality operations manual. You will want to test it, allow key management to provide feedback on their department and ensure that you aren't overlooking any areas. 
Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD)
This in depth legal document includes 23 mandatory disclosures outlining requirements, restrictions, obligations, contracts and more. This is where you will include the start up cost range you established when you evaluated your trade dress. Going beyond just contracts and fees, this document also communicates the expectations of the franchisee, as well as the franchisor. 
To avoid jumping into all the legal terms, here are several things to consider when starting:
What restrictions will you have on the franchisees (products allowed to sell, geographical restrictions, vendors, etc.)? What obligations will you expect of the franchisee?  What will the franchisee be able to expect of you? 
Account for Future Growth
Franchising creates tremendous opportunities to develop revenue streams. While the initial franchising fee is nice, the real profit comes from monthly fees, proprietary products and royalties. For example, a pizza restaurant franchisor could develop a proprietary pizza sauce, manufacture it and sell it to the franchises above cost, but below retail. 
The important step here is to spend time accounting for future opportunities. Developing these products should not hold up launching your franchise. Rather build in opportunities to develop proprietary products down the line. 
Royalties and Revenue
Once you complete the franchising process, there are several ways to go about gaining your first franchisees. While there are steps you can take to attract franchisees faster there is no clear way to determine how long that process will take. 
What is more predictable is the length of time it will be until your newest franchisee produces revenue for you. Your standard brick and mortar location takes 180 days to 9 months from signing to get up and running to the revenue producing point. This accounts for the time needed to lease a space, hire and train staff and become fully operational. Cut that time in half for your ecommerce or untraditional models. 
Just remember that once they are in full swing, your monthly royalties will start rolling in, paying you for your patience. 
Conclusion 
While the franchising process can seem overwhelming at times, remember that it is an in depth process now, but the overall gains in the long run make the process worth it. I encourage you to consider franchising as a part of your business plan, and I hope that this roadmap is the guide for your future success.

116,BUSINESS,One Man Against The Wall Street Lobby,"Simon Johnson, Contributor
Author, 'White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our Nation...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-connaughton-the-payoff_us_5bb2d08ce4b0480ca65c9d6f,There is a new powerful voice who knows how big banks really work and who is willing to tell the truth in great and convincing detail. Jeff Connaughton has just published a page-turning memoir that is also a damning critique of how Wall Street operates.,2012-08-25,BUSINESS,"Two diametrically opposed views of Wall Street and the dangers posed by global megabanks came more clearly into focus last week. On the one hand, William B. Harrison, Jr. -- former chairman of JP Morgan Chase -- argued in the New York Times that today's massive banks are an essential part of a well-functioning market economy, and not at all helped by implicit government subsidies.
On the other hand, there is a new powerful voice who knows how big banks really work and who is willing to tell the truth in great and convincing detail. Jeff Connaughton -- a former senior political adviser who has worked both for and against powerful Wall Street interests over the years -- has just published a page-turning memoir that is also a damning critique of how Wall Street operates, the political capture of Washington, and our collective failure to reform finance in the past four years. The Payoff: Why Wall Street Always Wins, is the perfect antidote to disinformation put about by global megabanks and their friends.
Specifically, Mr. Harrison makes six related arguments regarding why we should not break up our largest banks. Each of these is clearly and directly refuted by Mr. Connaughton's experience and the evidence he presents.
First, Mr. Harrison claims that megabanks are the natural outgrowth of requests from customers, rather than the result of extraordinary resources spent on lobbying over the past 30 years. Mr. Connaughton's book contains all you need to know -- and more than you can stomach -- about the realities of how the influence industry has worked diligently to build and defend megabanks. The people who really wanted the banks to become bigger were the executives in charge of those organizations -- like Mr. Harrison. They spent a lot of money to make this happen.
Second, Mr. Harrison takes the view that global megabanks at their current scale provide some special services that cannot be otherwise provided by smaller financial institutions.
As Mr. Connaughton points out -- including in a new blog post -- there are no economies of scale or scope in banks with over $100 billion of total assets. Our largest banks, properly measured, now have balance sheets between $2 trillion and $4 trillion. Plenty of people have attempted to show megabanks produce some magic for broader economy-wide productivity or multinational nonfinancial firms, but there is simply no evidence. Again, read Mr. Connaughton's book for more detail -- or look at my book with James Kwak on this topic, ""13 Bankers"".
Third, Mr. Harrison claims ""large global institutions have often proved more resilient than others because their diversified business model ensures that losses in one part of the enterprise can be cushioned by revenues in other parts.""
Mr. Connaughton's book reminds us, with some eloquence, that Citigroup and Bank of America -- the largest U.S. financial institutions in 2008 -- would have failed if it were not for the government bailouts that they received. As a matter of simple historical fact, the ""more resilient"" in Mr. Harrison's version of history is exactly the same as observing that those banks were seen by officials as ""too big to fail."" Their resilience came solely from support provided by the government and the Federal Reserve.
Fourth, Mr. Harrison denies that very large banks receive any implicit government subsidies. To support this view, Mr. Harrison suggests we should compare borrowing costs across financial and nonfinancial firms that share a similar bond rating (e.g., AA); he points out that the interest rate paid by financial firms in this comparison is higher. But the interest rate at which a company borrows depends not just on the risk of default, but also on the ""recovery value"" in the case of default (i.e., how much do creditors end up with after the company has been wound down). If you think you will recover less when I default, you should charge me a higher risk premium -- and thus a higher interest rate.
Mr. Harrison compares apples (finance) with oranges (nonfinance) -- and fails to mention that the recovery rate in the latter case is much higher. How much will investors recover in the case of Lehman, for example -- perhaps 25 cents after more than four years? For most nonfinancial companies, default does not by itself result in a big reduction in value (the deadweight costs for bankruptcy of such firms in the US are quite small); large financial firms are quite different (the deadweight bankruptcy costs are typically huge). Mr. Harrison's proposed comparison is simply uninformative -- you need to look at comparisons within the financial sector.
The right comparison is the funding cost of financial firms with and without implicit government support. The funding advantage for those perceived as Too Big To Fail is estimated to be between 25 and 75 basis points; most people close to the issue think it is at least 50 basis points. The idea that megabanks do not get huge, implicit subsides is simply priceless -- again, read Mr. Connaughton's account to see the lengths to which the banks will go to ensure these subsidies are kept in place.
Fifth, Mr. Harrison says that ""complexity can be an antidote to risk, rather than a cause of it"". On the contrary, the evidence suggests that management has consistently lost control over financial institutions with hundreds of thousands of employees in 50-100 countries. Think about the scandals of this summer: Barclays and Libor; HSBC or Standard Chartered and money laundering; and the severe breakdown of risk management at JP Morgan Chase. In each case, executives claim they did not know what was going on. The very largest banks have become too big to manage.
Sixth, Mr. Harrison claims regulators are not cowed by banks. The Payoff is all about how lobbying really works -- and how legislators and regulators are brought to heel. Money brings influence and influence is used to make more money. It is not about ""cowing"" anyone; it is about persuading them that you are right and should be allowed to do exactly what you want to do, even though your arguments are completely specious. Mr. Harrison's op ed is a nice example of the genre.
Some regulators have started to stand up to big banks on some issues, and this should be encouraged. But overall, Wall Street prevails on all the major issues, and most top officials at Treasury and the Federal Reserve are only too happy to cooperate.
Mr. Harrison makes strong claims. All of his arguments are demonstrably false. If you think Mr. Harrison and the other defenders of megabanks have even the slightest veneer of plausibility, you must read Jeff Connaughton's book.

117,BUSINESS,Governments Promise Punishment Over Horsemeat Scandal,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/horsemeat-punishment_us_5bb2e79fe4b0480ca65e6ad3,The British unit of frozen foods group Findus began a recall this week of its beef lasagne from retailers on advice from,2013-02-09,BUSINESS,"* France says beef contaminated with horse came from Romania
* Findus planning legal action against suppliers
* Britain warns more cases of contamination could emerge
* Romania checking whether its abattoirs supplied the meat
By Leigh Thomas and Tim Castle
PARIS/LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The French and British governments promised on Saturday to punish those found responsible for selling horsemeat in beef products at the heart of a growing scandal that started in Britain but is quickly spreading to France.
French Consumer Affairs Minister Benoit Hamon said an investigation had found that the horsemeat had originated in Romania, although there were links with French, Dutch and Cypriot firms and a factory in Luxembourg.
British environment minister Owen Paterson said more cases of contaminated food could emerge as British retailers conducted tests for horsemeat on processed beef products. The scandal threatens to affect consumer confidence in Europe's giant food industry, with pressure rising for greater checks.
The British unit of frozen foods group Findus began a recall this week of its beef lasagne from retailers on advice from its French supplier, Comigel, over concerns that some packs contained high levels of horsemeat.
Findus France said it too had recalled lasagne and two other products after discovering that they included horsemeat from Romania rather than beef from France as it had thought.
Hamon said an EU-wide alert had been sent out and that it was not yet clear whether there had been an intentional fraud or the meat had been sold as beef by accident.
""I can assure you that, whether it's a question of negligence or direct responsibility, there will be sanctions,"" Hamon said on iTele television. 
LEGAL COMPLAINT
Findus France Director General Matthieu Lambeaux said in a statement the company would file a legal complaint on Monday.
""We thought we had certified French beef in our products. But in reality, we were supplied with Romanian horsemeat. We have been deceived,"" Lambeaux said.
Hamon said a Luxembourg factory had been supplied by the French firm Poujol, which had bought the meat frozen from a Cypriot trader, who in turn sub-contracted the order to a Dutch trader supplied by a Romanian abattoir.
However, Findus's supplier Comigel, a frozen foods producer based in eastern France, told a newspaper it had bought the meat from another French company, supplied from a Romanian abattoir.
Romanian authorities said they would punish any violations if the reports were confirmed.
""The agriculture ministry and food safety authority will try to identify as soon as possible whether the (meat) comes from Romania. If legislation was broken, they will punish such practices that damage the image of the entire industry,"" Romania's agriculture ministry said.
In Britain Findus said it believed the contamination was deliberate.
""The early results from Findus UK's internal investigation strongly suggests that the horsemeat contamination in beef lasagne was not accidental,"" it said.
Findus's product recall was followed in Britain by supermarket chain Aldi, which withdrew two frozen beef products supplied by Comigel after they tested positive for horsemeat.
Paterson summoned Britain's leading food retailers and representatives of food processors to an emergency meeting at his office in London on Saturday to discuss the crisis.
He said participants were determined to get to the bottom of a scandal which he said was either caused by ""gross incompetence or what I suspect is an international criminal conspiracy"".
Britain's government is under pressure to appear on top of the scandal, which comes less than a month after supermarket chain Tesco and fast food outlet Burger King found horsemeat in beef burgers from an Irish supplier.
Britons generally do not eat horsemeat, regarding its consumption as a quirk of French appetites. However, the meat has also fallen out of favour with consumers in France.

118,BUSINESS,Reshaping What We Think About the Gender Pay Gap,"Anastasia T Hou, ContributorSenior at Wellesley College",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reshaping-what-we-think-a_b_5302323.html,The convergence of human capital differences between men and women suggests that there must be another explanation for the remaining gender pay gap.,2014-05-12,BUSINESS,"Equal pay in the workplace is viewed as the next step in combating gender inequality. Just last month, President Obama signed two executive orders that aimed at narrowing the gender pay gap, but one study proposes that the solution to equal pay does not have to involve government intervention. In her 2014 Presidential Address to the American Economic Association, Claudia Goldin explained that the most important factor in reducing the gender pay gap is for employers to offer and not penalize greater work schedule flexibility. 
In the past, gender inequality was explained by human capital differences between men and women, including differences in the level of education and years of experience. But today, much of the human capital differences has been squeezed out as more than 75 percent of working age women participate in the workforce (compared to under 40 percent in the 1950s) and more than half of all college graduates are female. The convergence of human capital differences between men and women suggests that there must be another explanation for the remaining gender pay gap. 
US data provide two clues to finding the explanation. First, the gender pay gap widens with age. Take a woman born in 1968. When she was 26 years old and had just started her career, her annual earnings was, on average, 90% that of her male counterpart. By the time she turned 40, her annual earnings was only 75% that of her male counterpart. This trend is uniform across birth cohorts and parallels the intuition that women's earnings decrease as they become mothers and have more childrearing responsibilities. It is not only that women work fewer hours, but in many occupations they also receive less per-hour pay than do their male counterparts. 
Second, Goldin observed that the gender gap differs greatly by occupation and most wage differences are concentrated within occupations, which means that women earn less not entirely because they choose to work in lower-paid professions--her data show that occupational choice only explains 30 percent of the pay gap. She also found that the earnings gap is especially large in law and business occupations and less pronounced in science, technology and health occupations. 
The findings that starting salaries for men and women are comparable and that the pay gap differs by occupation counter the common rhetoric that gender discrimination mostly explains the gender pay gap. According to Goldin, it has more to do with the different occupations' flexibility in work hours.
The difference in the pay gap across occupations is related to the nature of the work. Consider law and business occupations where the work is highly interpersonal and emphasizes building face-to-face relationships with co-workers and clients. When an employee is not around for a team meeting, she brings down the team's productivity because she has missed the information conveyed at the meeting. When an employee is unavailable to serve her client, her expertise in that particular case makes it hard for the employer to substitute her with another employee. Her absence or time-off is costly for the firm and so her value to the firm decreases. 
Because an employee's productivity is tied to being available, these occupations award a premium on working long hours--someone working 80 hours per week will make more than double the person working 40 hours per week. This work structure is especially harmful for women because they tend to require more flexible hours to accommodate childbearing and childcare. But anyone who needs to work flexible hours or take time off is less productive to the firm so will be paid less, whether male or female. 
Health occupations have not always had smaller pay gaps but today they do. Certain occupations in the health industry have successfully leveraged the use of information systems to make work schedule flexibility more feasible and less costly to the organization. Goldin examines the pharmacy profession for insights. 
Today when you walk into any pharmacy, the pharmacist on duty can see all of your past prescriptions online. Pharmacists are highly paid but they are also essentially interchangeable; the spread of vast information systems and the standardization of drugs have enhanced the ability of pharmacists to hand off clients costlessly. As a result, if a female pharmacist needs to work fewer hours for childcare, she will be paid less for working less but not paid a lower hourly wage. Holding constant hours worked, the gender pay gap among pharmacists almost vanishes.
If some occupations, like pharmacist, have successfully integrated information systems to allow for more flexibility in work schedules, then why are law and business occupations not making this shift? Goldin emphasizes that law and business occupations need to change the structure of the work so that it involves greater independence and autonomy and should allow employees to substitute seamlessly for each other. 
Goldin suggests that these changes do not necessarily require government policy intervention and can be implemented at the firm level. Although Goldin encourages all occupations to make such changes in the work structure, she does not discuss the feasibility of this transition. Interpersonal and trust-based client relations define good service in law and business; what has been done in pharmacy with information systems might not be possible to do in law and business. In these professions, we may not be able to reduce the gender pay gap much further unless women stop having children or there is more equal sharing of childcare responsibilities between husbands and wives.

You're in your budding days as an entrepreneur. You wake up and stare at the blank slate of a day that lies before you. When you think about all that you have to do, the blank slate becomes a tangle of items that you don't know how to prioritize. Paralysis sets in and several hours pass before you realize that you've done little more than hang out on the Internet. 
That's when the panic arrives. How in the world are you supposed to grow your business if overwhelm sets in every time you think about all that you have to do?
I used to experience this phenomenon more times that I care to admit. It was always ironic when I would go through this because one of the principal reasons I quit my job to become an entrepreneur was to have more control over how I spend my time. And yet, having complete control over my schedule threatened to kill my productivity.
Awareness has helped transform my inner stance so that I can make the most of my days as an entrepreneur. Below, I share a few strategies that can help you exponentially increase your productivity.
Create structure
One of the biggest changes in the switch from employment to entrepreneurship is that business and personal life melt together without clear demarcations. This is particularly true when working from home, and I can easily go from coaching a client to having a chat with my love to watering the plants to Skyping my niece to writing an article, all over the course of a couple of hours. Jumping from task to task really drains me, and I've had to learn how to build in structure so that there are clear hours when I'm working, and clear hours when I'm not. I've found that there are times when I'm naturally more productive (between 11AM and 7P), and so I commit to working within that timeframe (taking several breaks for sanity). The rest of the time I claim as mine to spend however I wish.
Creating a productive working space is also important. At home I tend to float between the couch and kitchen table while working and I use several props to get into a proper mindset. There's my laptop, a notebook with a pen, and also my to-do list. Having my to-do list in plain sight subtly helps me stay focused. (Checking items off and looking over all that I've completed in a day makes me feel really good). On days when working from home just isn't cutting it because of distractions, I head to a cafe where I can laser in and focus for a few hours.
The key here is to create structure while remaining flexible. For example, if I have to switch things up and work earlier or a later to accommodate items I need to complete, I do that. (And if I need to cut my working day short to allow for more flex time, I do that too). But a structured day remains the status quo for me. It makes me a happier entrepreneur and person.
Drop overwhelm as a badge of self-importance
This was the hardest for me to implement. Whenever people would ask me how I was doing, I would secretly get satisfaction out of going on and on about how ""busy"" and ""overwhelmed"" I was. I would create an entire drama around all of the items that I ""absolutely had"" to complete within a day, even though accomplishing that feat was unrealistic. 
Reading Steve Chandler's Time Warrior helped clue me into what I was doing: ""Your problem is not that you are overwhelmed,"" Steve Chandler writes, ""Your problem is an attachment to the story of overwhelm.""
That insight caused me to closely look at my own story. Most importantly, it helped me cut away all of the self-importance that using terms like ""overwhelmed"" and ""swamped"" made me feel. Once I did this, I realized taking this stance was setting me up for failure. I was playing a game that I would never win because I would always have a daunting list of things to do. Additionally, I was unconsciously ensuring that I would always be overwhelmed so that I could earn sympathy from those I shared my story with.
""You can drop the story,"" Chandler advises, ""Try this story: 'I've only got one thing to do! How liberating. It's the thing I'm doing right now.'""
When I dropped my story, I immediately had energy to use in productive ways. The payoff was exponential. Instead of seeking pity from others, I was able to talk about far more interesting things than a to-do list. I also began accomplishing more and reaped the benefits of feeling complete at the end of the day. I'll take this over a badge of self-importance any day.
Consciously choose items to complete and items to put off to another day
The best way to integrate the above point is to be super realistic about what can be accomplished within a day, hour and minute. What's the most important thing to be done in this moment? Do that and forget everything else.
Here's the thing. Sometimes there are very important items to be done within a day and I realistically can't get to everything. This used to really bother me and I'd spend my time accomplishing one task while worriedly eyeing the other important tasks I had to complete. Fortunately I've found a way to deal with this:
I let the relevant parties know if I will be unable to complete something by a promised deadline AND provide a timeframe as to when it will get done. 
I've had to learn that it's not the fact of having a lot of things to do that trips me up. It's the story that I create around it. Letting people know that something will be late immediately frees me up. It makes me feel responsible and as if I have control over my schedule. I get to stay in a place of consciously choosing how to spend my time which is really what I've wanted all along.
An extra note about the Internet
I'm not doing this post justice if I don't mention the Internet. Given a lot of my work is done via computer, it's very easy for me to spend time wandering down paths that aren't very productive (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, etc). It's a habit that I've developed (I think it's safe to say that I'm not alone here), and I've not found a surefire way around this. One of the things I've been focusing on is awareness around how I use the computer. I've been using a productivity app that tracks time spent on different sites. It's been really helpful for me to see where my computer time goes. Several moments checking friends' status updates on Facebook can really add up over the course of the week. In all honesty, I'm not doing much about this other than being aware of it. Awareness and observation are foundational for any habit changes that I choose to make.
Once the euphoria of working for yourself wears off, it's important to adopt a stance and mindset that ensure you are experiencing life and business on your terms. An important part of this is maintaining control over your time and enhancing your productivity. Give the above tips a try and let me know how they're working for you.

120,COLLEGE,'I Was Naive' Says Subject Of Discredited Rolling Stone Rape Story,Sebastian Murdock,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rolling-stone-rape-story-video-testimony_us_580f6d43e4b02444efa55205,"Columbia Journalism School described the story as ""a journalistic failure.""",2016-10-25,EDUCATION,"The woman at the center of a discredited Rolling Stone article on an alleged rape defended herself in videotaped testimony for jurors Monday morning, placing blame on the journalist who interviewed her and claiming she didn’t know what “on-the-record” meant.
“A Rape On Campus,” a 2014 article by Sabrina Rubin Erdely, followed “Jackie,” a University of Virginia student who alleged she had been gang raped by men from the same fraternity when she was a freshman at the school. But the 9,000 word story was later retracted after a report from Columbia Journalism School found that Jackie’s accounts had been fabricated, leading to “a journalistic failure that was avoidable.” Erdely had also failed to interview any of the suspects in the alleged crime.
Nicole Eramo, a former associate dean of students at the University of Virginia, is now seeking $7.9 million in damages from the magazine. Eramo believes she was painted as the central villain of Erdely’s piece.
On Monday, a videotaped deposition from Jackie was played for jurors. Her real name has not been revealed, and reporters were able to hear the audio but could not see her face, according to Yahoo.
Jackie said she thought that the details of her alleged rape would be private and not the central piece of the story.
“I was under the impression that they were not going to be published,” Jackie said. “I was naïve.” 
She also said she did not understand phrases including “on-the-record” and “off-the-record,” according to Yahoo.
“I remember [Erdely] telling me there was no way for me to pull out at that point,” Jackie said in her testimony. “I remember feeling scared and overwhelmed and unsure of what to do. I felt like I was getting a lot of pressure from a lot of different people and I didn’t know what to do. I did not want to participate in the article at that point.”
During the three-hour testimony, Jackie repeatedly said she could not remember or had forgotten what she’d told Erdely, and said her memory was “foggy” because she suffered from post traumatic stress disorder. (Jackie maintains that she was assaulted.)
Erdely said it was a mistake to “rely on someone intent to deceive me,” but asserted that her story did not hurt Eramo’s reputation, who is still employed with the university. 
“We made journalistic mistakes with respect to Jackie’s story and we have learned from them, but these mistakes do not support Dean Eramo’s lawsuit,” Rolling Stone said in a statement to ABC News on Thursday.

But for one school, the revolution is only just beginning.
UC Berkeley took home the tour's top prize on Saturday, winning a free MetroNaps EnergyPod, which ordinarily retails for $13,000 dollars. In order to receive the nap pod, UC Berkeley submitted the winning photo in a Facebook competition hosted by Arianna Huffington. Eleven schools sent in photos featuring students, university staff or mascots napping in odd places around campus. The most-liked photo by the end of the #SleepRevolution College Tour took home the top prize. With over three thousand likes, UC Berkeley beat out the other ten campuses. Their unbeatable entry? Three sleepy Golden Bears hibernating in the library.
""This is a great way to end the year,"" Berkeley student and Huffington Post editor-at-large Rigel Robinson said of his school's win. ""Our student government has spent much of this year on sleep campaigns and opening up our new REST Zones on campus, and this new EnergyPod feeds right into our work here."" 
Robinson has an idea as to where they'll put their brand new nap pod. ""Many computer science and engineering students on campus are really the most likely to be suffering from sleep deprivation and are also geographically taking their classes farther from the student union and other centers of campus where most of our REST Zones are,"" Robinson said. ""With this new EnergyPod, we may consider situating it somewhere more accessible to students of those majors.""
Congratulations to UC Berkeley and thanks to all the colleges that competed!

Whether we're making up for an all-nighter or just catching up on snoozing during our free time, napping is a common college activity across the nation.
It's easy to feel lazy as you crawl into your bed for a nap when you could be finishing up homework or getting ahead on reading for class, but a study recently proved that a 30-minute nap can actually reverse the hormonal impact that comes from a night of poor sleep.
If you still haven't mastered the art of time management or you spent the night cramming for your exam, schedule in that short power nap because it is worth it. 
If you've found yourself buried in books until the early hours, know that you're not alone. The study also found that nearly 10 adults reported that they slept six hours or less per night, clearly missing out on the benefits that can be reaped from sleeping for the recommended eight hours of sleep.
Powering through with no sleep can be hard, so make sure to carve time out of your schedule for some quick yet serious rest. Power naps have also shows to help relieve stress and improve the immune systems. While this data comes from men who only slept two hours the previous night, it was made clear that power naps can truly turn things around. Even if you feel like you're overwhelmed with work, if you're running low on sleep, skip out on resorting to caffeine and allow yourself to fit a 30-minute nap into your schedule. 
Everything we do in our daily routine can be pointed back towards our sleep patterns, so cramming in the power nap is just as important as cramming in the studying the night before.
Here's how to prepare for the perfect power nap:
1. Before you crawl into bed, make a short to-do list so you don't wake up feeling stressed. While it's important to make time for some rest and rejuvenation, it's a terrible feeling to wake up feeling unproductive and cloudy. Making a to-do list will make you feel structured and organized when you're ready to get going again. 2. When you're thinking about location for your nap, make sure you're somewhere where you won't be woken up. Aim for your bed instead of the couch of your living room or the love seat by the TV, because nothing is worse than an interrupted power nap. If you're in the room with you're door shut, you're bound to actually fall asleep without interruption. 3. Limit your distractions. Don't crawl into bed with your iPad or phone in hand because technological distractions will prevent you from falling asleep quickly. The bright screen will keep your mind and eyes awake longer, and that means less time for that well-deserved shuteye. 4. Even if you think you're just going to close your eyes for a few minutes, make sure you set an alarm so your 30-minute nap doesn't accidentally turn into a 3-hour snooze fest. 5. Be sure to make the room dark and quiet. You don't have much time to catch up on your Z's, so make sure you've created the ideal environment for your nap. 
Next time you take your power nap, remember these tips and snooze away! Trust me, the health benefits totally make it worth it.

Better yet, how do individuals experience college differently? A few weeks ago I became interested in learning how women of color experience Ivy League institutions. In ""Black Women in the Ivy League: Everything's Not So Pretty at the Top"", I explored my own feelings, along with that of other woman, about being a women of color at Princeton and other Ivies like Harvard, Columbia, and University of Pennsylvania. Readers were intrigued, and I was later compelled to post two subsequent pieces about dating and other untold stories. With such an overwhelming positive response to the articles, it dawned on me, ""How do Black men in the Ivies feel?"" Why not ask my fellow brethren at Princeton to start the discussion?
While I knew these men would have powerful stories, I didn't realize the importance of sharing them until I received one of my first responses to my call for submission via Facebook message. 
It started pretty normal.
 ""Hey Rana! Thanks for reaching out. While being black and male in the Ivy League is no monolithic experience, I do think there exists commonalities among the experiences of black males at these institutions. For one, there is this presumption that black men have matriculated based off things outside of their own merit...
Then he sent me a short ""hold on.""
A few minutes later, he continued.
""As I was writing this in the depths of Fine Hall basement, I was just approached and prompted by an officer asking whether or not I was a student. He proceeded to ask to me to give my identification ... wow this is so ironic and crazy that this happened just as I was writing you.""
I was speechless. 
Yes, it is true that being a student at Princeton is not a ""monolithic experience"" and, as many of the men relayed in their writings to me, can be ""highly rewarding."" As the I Too Am Princeton campaign showed, it's also true that American institutions have a painful history of racial inequity, discrimination, and prejudice towards people of color. This group's perspectives, sentiments, and realities are often not shared publicly in a setting where a history of elitism, privilege, and power is deeply-rooted. 
Below, you will find excerpts from the larger piece I worked on called Unsilencing the Silenced: Black Men at Princeton.
Read and respect. 
Editor's Note: The following excerpts contain explicit language that some readers may find objectionable.
ON THE EXPECTATION TO ENDURE IT ALL IN SILENCE
When you're among the first in your family or community to be attending an institution such as Princeton and getting a Bachelor's degree, failure simply isn't even an option with so many eyes looking to you. ...[and then] there's the battle against the mythos of the strong black man which means that expressing emotion beyond anger or happiness, seeking help when needed, when worn out, when feeling overwhelmed by the pressure, is frowned upon or seen as ""quitting'"" or ""admitting defeat."" When challenges, struggles, or failures occurred, there's an expectation to endure it all in silence and simply persevere.
When you see anonymous commentators [on Daily Princetonian articles] reducing your classmates and your identity to 'prone to violence,' 'moves in packs,' 'undeserving candidate,' or other such unflattering terms, it's no wonder feelings of being the 'other' among black Princetonians persist. The anonymity means that you begin to question whether your peers in precept, passing acquaintances, friends, or even the very campus community you find yourself in actually harbor those thoughts towards you and those like you or even just view you as some freakish puzzle to be figured out or put in a box.

 ""I AM AN ATHLETE. I WAS NOT RECRUITED.""
Here, people generalize most black males to be recruited athletes. Although, I am an athlete myself, I was not recruited. Where did the term scholar-athlete go when people begin to generalize black males on this campus? Apparently it's not a fathomable option. This stereotype is one of the things that push to me to do my best -- to disprove the nonbelievers. I want to show people that black males can excel in both academics and athletics.
Would an Ivy League institution where blacks were the majority be viewed as prestigiously as the ones we have today? Unfortunately, I believe not.
[As obvious] minorities at Ivy League institutions, some people view us as out of place, as if we don't belong. And for some black males on this campus, this is the exact sentiment they feel -- out of place. 
There is no quitting for me. I don't want your pity.

ON RACISM AND THE ""N WORD""
​I've had five experiences of racism and I'm only a freshman. One day I was at one of the parties and I happened to be talking to a friend but I was standing next to two white people and one of them was (I'm guessing) drunk and I overheard him say that he wasn't going to try to get into that eating club because it's for niggers. I did respond to him. I reverted back to what I would do if I was in Atlanta and went in. He was like ""Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry."" He didn't even see me. That's what really irked me. I know that some Caucasian people say the ""n word"" and some people don't care. He was was genuinely saying the ""n word"" to talk down on Black people. He didn't know I was behind him. When he saw me, he was like, ""Oh shit."" An argument ensued and that turned into something else and that escalated and escalated so of course it ended with him trying to apologize but I was angry as hell. 
I do think that people need to come in here prepared. Don't come in here with this attitude that you will fit right in. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of [diverse] friends, but I do realize there are a lot of people here that think that minorities are only here because of affirmative action.

ON NOT FEELING ""GOOD ENOUGH""
Being a man of color at Princeton was probably the most psychologically/mentally challenging experiences I have ever had. From an intellectual standpoint, Princeton is difficult for everyone, but being African American and male made it even harder. When I first came to Princeton, I did not feel like I belonged. I did not feel like I was intelligent enough to actually study at such an elite institution. Most of my peers did not help me overcome that self-doubt. While not always explicitly stated, I constantly felt like people thought I was at Princeton for a reason other than my intelligence. I cannot tell you how many times I was asked if I was on the basketball team.
This really ate at me during my first years at Princeton, as I always felt like I had to defend my right to attend the University, which served as a distraction from focusing on my school work. When working on a project in group settings, my opinion and contributions were frequently ignored by the rest of the group, only to be acknowledged or accepted when someone else brought up the same point a few minutes later in the discussion. This really drove me crazy because the mind games (intentional or not) made me feel insane, as the lines between what I thought occurred and what I could have imagined were blurred. I do not think that I every really learned to deal with the constant subtle attacks. Instead, I just brushed them off and focused on my ultimate goal - graduating.

""ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE AND HUMBLING EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE""
My experience at Princeton was one of the most valuable and humbling experiences of my life. Coming from an urban area as a man of color and going to an Ivy League school I was conditioned by my community to be told that my shit didn't stink. Princeton proved this to be VERY wrong. Not only was my intelligence a non-factor, my skin color and socioeconomic background both served as factors that made me feel inadequate.
The challenges that I faced at Princeton due to the color of my skin and my background forced me out of my comfort zone and made me stay there. While it is true that the Ivy League experience was not catered to people who look like me, I do believe that it molded me into a more understanding and overall better person who understands and knows how to deal with such discrepancies and properly lead the way for those behind me.

""IT'S AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL, NOT AN HBCU. WHAT DO PEOPLE EXPECT?""
I'm going to sound like an outlier, but I felt thoroughly fulfilled socially at Princeton. My Blackness was never a problem. Most black folk I've talked with always have something negative to say about the Princeton experience -- in fact, everything they say is negative. They often claim to have been depressed by the environment, and in particular, by the social scene, including the ""nonexistent"" dating scene.
When it came to the racial and ethnic makeup, I felt the numbers weren't so bad. I'd done my research, and there seemed to be plenty enough blacks. It's an Ivy League school, not an HBCU. What do people expect?

""I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT 'BLACK ENOUGH' FOR BLACK WOMEN TO FIND ME ATTRACTIVE""
I'm frustratingly shy when it comes to girls, I don't drink and casual hookups personally aren't for me so I actually haven't had any relationships or hookups at Princeton. However I think my status as a black man also holds me back from being more social around girls. I tend to think compared to the athletes, I'm ""not black enough"" or impressive enough for black women to find me attractive. I have also heard non-black girls expressing how their parents wouldn't want them to get involved with a black man so that makes me more hesitant to approach them as well. While every guy has a fear of being rejected, I'm jealous that my white friends will rarely ever wonder ""I wonder if she likes white guys"" when talking to a girl. Also I feel the quiet pressure from my parents to date a black woman while I know my sisters are under no such expectation. While I know they will happily accept a relationship with a non-black person if that woman loved me, I'm also well aware of the stereotype of academically accomplished black men marrying white women.

ONE OF THE ""MOST DRASTIC SOCIAL CHANGES I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED""
I made the transition to a graduate program at Princeton from Morehouse College, an HBCU. It was one of the most drastic social changes I've ever experienced. I expected that Princeton would have a different social environment, but I didn't realize the extent of alienation and isolation I would experience. At Morehouse I was a part of a supportive community with culturally and socially similar individuals, but I found that these factors were not present in Princeton.
I feel responsible for proving that minorities deserve opportunities at elite research institutions. I feel constant pressure to justify my existence with every research talk, seminar, or one on one interaction. As one of the only black men in my program my opinions and interactions can often be perceived as the thoughts, skills, and abilities of other minorities. Even with success, I find it hard to change people's preconceived notions. However, I have no regrets, and I do feel fortunate to attend and learn from some of the best scholars in the world.

Answer by Ariana K Lema, B.S. Resource Economics
I believe the rule of thumb is to not take out more in student loan debt for an education than you expect to earn as an annual salary. However, none of this matters now, so I won't go on with scolding. You may regret the amount you have taken out for your education, but never regret having received a quality education.
Here are some of the things you should do if at all possible. Yes, if possible -- and I don't mean if you feel like it or would prefer to. These recommendations are on the basis of not being married or having children in the near future.
We'll assume you're taking about 25% out of your earnings for deductions (health, retirement at 5% income, etc.) and taxes. You should be on the 25-year plan for the loans, and if not, find a way to switch because there is an option for that. Ideally, you would be able to consolidate to a 15-year plan, but I'll use my example based on the 25-year.
Now, you are going to pay these off in fewer than 25 years, but it's safer to have a lower payment just in case you have other obligations. Let's say your monthly loan payment is $525 at the minimum payment on this plan. After taxes, deductions and loan payments, you have about $2,600 left over.
Make a monthly budget based on this -- rent, electricity, additional healthcare costs, other utilities, Internet, transit pass or gas, maintenance if you have a car, cell phone plan, etc., and put whatever you can toward an emergency fund until you have enough to cover two to three months of necessary expenses. For you, an emergency fund would be $1,100 at the minimum, but more likely should be upwards of $3,000 to be safe.
Below are a few suggestions for tackling student loan debt:
Make a 10-year timeline of what you want to do and where you want to be. I'm not talking specifics, but just generally. Tell yourself you can overcome this debt within 10 years. Know that you can and that you will. The first step is having faith in yourself. Tell yourself you can overcome this debt within 10 years. Know that you can and that you will. The first step is having faith in yourself.
Consider your spending habits and how you can change them easily before getting into the harder aspects.
Move back home for a set time period. Stop paying rent, fees, etc. If you can do so, move home. Even if parents/grandparents/etc. charge you rent, it'll probably be less than what you're paying now or would be on your own. If you cannot move home, find roommates. Live in a room in a house in an average neighborhood where the cost will be much lower.
Don't have more than one credit card. You won't need it and it's unnecessary temptation. Credit card interest is worse than student loan interest. You can't save money if you're paying off credit cards because of the rates. Also, make that credit card one with good cash back. Given that you're not making a ton of money, a good bet is the DiscoverIt card. It also gives you your credit score every month, which is a cool feature and handy to know. As I searched for the best credit card, this one stuck out and still does as a good option for younger people. Just avoid the ones with monthly fees.
Don't pay any banking fees. Google your way to many examples of how to make this happen.
Consolidate your loans for the lowest rate if you haven't already. Shop around, get rate quotes from several banks, big and small.
Make sure you are putting 5% or so into your 401(k) every week through automatic deductions at work.**
Invest in index funds and ride out the recessions and booms. Anyone under 35 is in a great position to do this. It's really just ""invest and forget"" with index funds, until you need to switch it up in later years. Investing is an entirely separate lesson, however -- plenty of good advice on Quora for that. In short, S&P is usually solid. However, I've had success with the NASDAQ. Just make sure you choose a good fund or index when you invest and be sure to check out fees.
Stop drinking. Stop recreational drugs. Stop smoking. Stop Starbucks. Stop going to the casino. Stop all of the things that eat away at your paycheck every week, whatever your vice is.
If you need to go out with coworkers to fit in and network to get that promotion, order cheap drinks. Or, order one expensive drink and sip it slowly with water on the side. Trust me, they won't notice. If they do, change the subject. It's not a big deal. If your friends ask why you aren't going out as much, you don't have to even mention debt. Say something like, ""I'm saving for a down payment on a house."" No one should argue with that goal, or whatever you come up with.
Realize how regular spending can affect your ability to achieve financial freedom and get out of debt. Spending money is not the right way to cope with not having enough money.
Eat at home more and go out to eat less. Eat leftovers. If you make good food that is better for you, it's helpful long-term too.
Pack lunch: A sandwich and an apple from home is cheaper than Panera.
Set up direct deposit to your checking account from work, then set up an automatic transfer to your savings to happen at the same time. Out of sight, out of mind. With student loans, automated payments can sometimes get you a rebate on the interest rate of .25%, which can add up.
Automate everything to go where it needs to go: savings, retirement, credit card, rent if you have it. I have more than one savings account so I can separate rent and utilities in one, general savings in another and anything I will spend in less than 30 days in my checking. Organizing your finances is crucial. You don't want to forget about your cell phone bill and blow your cash on a night out.
Utilize Google Calendar for recurring due dates. Then add everything else you have to pay, but also add in fun things like holidays and days off. Pay day is also good to add if you're on a bi-weekly or irregular schedule. Stay organized.
If you can get a health savings account and you need prescriptions regularly, take advantage of that tax-free account as well with deductions. Prescriptions are expensive enough as it is.
If you can choose which loans to pay off first, go with the ones with the highest interest rates. Make sure you keep up with this each time you pay off a loan.
Downgrade your phone to something basic unless you absolutely need it for work. Minimize your data. Try to get on your parents' plan for collective savings if possible.
Avoid financial advisers. They are a waste of money.
After establishing your two to three month emergency fund over a few months (to cover necessities), start aggressively paying down your debt. Throw as much at the principal as you possibly can without tapping into your savings. Start with high-interest first.
If you are able to consolidate all of your loans to one low-interest rate, congratulations; just tackle that. More likely, you will have several loans, even if some are consolidated, at different rates. Make the minimum payments on the low rates and pay down the principal on the high-rate loans.
Put all of your loans in a spreadsheet with the total amount paid to-date, amount owed, interest rate and the minimum payment on it per month. If you're good with Excel, set up a calculator to determine the interest in dollars to be owed on each loan and how much you have saved by paying X amount so far. However you set it up, update it monthly and track your progress. It may not be the same every month -- things come up -- but watching your progress is crucial and can be motivating after you get a few months going. watching your progress is crucial and can be motivating after you get a few months going.
Cut down your TV subscription to basic cable, or cancel it completely if you don't find it necessary. Also downgrade your Internet to something very cheap unless you're in an industry, position or department that requires you to work from home with high-speed Internet.
Cut subscriptions as much as possible, whatever they may be. Don't get more magazines that you actually read. Don't pay Netflix or Hulu if you don't use their services regularly.
Don't go five years without being promoted. If you aren't moving up or getting raises, look elsewhere -- even if casually. Opportunities are always popping up when you don't need them.
Use public transit. Walk to work if you're close enough or bike. Commuting by car is almost always more expensive when you consider maintenance, gas, the need to replace it as it gets old, paying for parking, etc. And if you have to get stuck in traffic, it isn't terrible to be sitting on a bus or train reading. Commuting by public transit is increasingly the way of the future. If you have no access to public transit, obviously you don't have the same luxury of choice. Take care of your car -- it's one of those expenses that is easy to forget about.
Take care of your health. Exercise and eat well. As I've said, prescriptions are expensive. So are specialist doctors and life-long diseases that could have been prevented. Take advantage of the preventative care options your health plan offers you.
Stay realistic with your financial goals, but also keep your sanity. Take your paid vacation days, don't cash them out, don't burn out. Set aside money to do something you love at least once a month -- whether that is going out to a bar/party, affordable concert, a few trips to the movies, day trip, spa day, whatever. I would cap this spending at100-150.
Pick up cheap or free hobbies (hiking, programming, reading, yoga, etc.) but don't feel like you can't treat yourself because you're in debt. It's just about moderation. You may find that you enjoy the simpler lifestyle, or at least get used to it.
Don't listen to everything I've told you or think that I'm trying to push you. Just soak it all in and do what you can to best fit your needs and specific situation. Just realize that whatever you do, it will likely require a lifestyle change if you're serious about achieving financial freedom. You'll be very happy that you did.
Again, and finally, take care of yourself and good luck.
**Now don't tell me this is no time to money put toward retirement. Now is always the time, at least in small amounts.

127,COLLEGE,"Tuition Cuts and Tuition ""Cuts""","Frank H. Wu, ContributorDistinguished Professor, UC Hastings College of the Law",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tuition-cuts-and-tuition_b_5306597.html,"In a recent report on the state of legal education, Moody's, the credit rating service, noted in passing that tuition cuts are not necessarily an effective tactic for improving enrollment. The rationale is important for people to understand.",2014-05-11,EDUCATION,"In a recent report on the state of legal education, Moody's, the credit rating service, noted in passing that tuition cuts are not necessarily an effective tactic for improving enrollment. The rationale is important for people to understand.
Tuition cuts might not be all that they appear to be. The reason is virtually all institutions of higher education already discount tuition to a great extent. Almost all of them also are tuition dependent: Their operating budget comes from what students pay them.
That is the case for the highly-regarded and the not so reputable. Public institutions and those that value public service typically return a significant amount of their tuition revenue to their students in the form of need-based financial aid. Other schools that wish to recruit highly-credentialed students award scholarships on the basis of those metrics. Some of the moneys for these purposes may come from endowments, but much of it comes from what students themselves are putting into the coffers.
Whether it is meant to help many students by offering the opportunity for higher education or buy a few of them by rewarding earlier academic records, the budgetary consequence is the same. As with most other ventures, there is a difference between gross and net.
So a tuition cut may well leave many, perhaps most, individuals worse off as compared to the baseline. Here are the consequences of a cut to tuition.
Assume before it publicizes a cut, a school has a program oriented toward need-based grants. It may be giving as many as three-quarters of its students such packages. Only a quarter of them are paying the full sticker price. Three-quarters pay less; the one-quarter make that possible.
Now after a cut, that school has two choices. (We can put to the side the equivalent of money falling from the sky: alternate revenue sources. They exist, but they usually are an order of magnitude less than what would be needed to offset significant tuition decreases.)
The first option is a real cut. The school could reduce expenditures in a manner commensurate to its loss of total tuition coming in. To be pointed about what that means: Since human resources are the bulk of the budget, such a real cut means faculty, staff, or both, would have to be paid less or be laid off. Savings from the non-personnel share of the budget are not likely to be sufficient to make ends meet.
The second option is the illusion of a ""cut."" The school could reduce what insiders call the ""discount rate"" to exactly the amount that makes up for the tuition drop. Again to be pointed about what that means: Given that most students previously received generous grants, most of them end up actually paying more. The students who were not receiving grants prior are the only ones who in fact benefit.
To illustrate it with numbers, consider the simplest possible example. Suppose Acme Law School had two students (in this hypothetical, each of them stands in for hundreds who are treated identically); and a ""rack rate"" of $50,000 per year. Alpha, who is impoverished, receives a $10,000 grant; Bravo, who is well-to-do, receives no grant. 
The real cost of attendance for a year (not including living expenses) is as follows. Alpha expends $40,000 ($50,000 tuition less a grant); Bravo, $50,000 (the stated tuition with no break). 
Imagine then Acme Law School announces a tuition cut of 10 percent or $5,000. Its new, much-praised ""flat rate"" is $45,000. 
But the leaders of Acme Law School do not wish to affect its programs. That frames their intentions in the most positive terms. They need to maintain the same overall revenue the school was receiving from Alpha and Bravo notwithstanding the cut, which is $90,000 (the $40,000 from the former plus the $50,000 from the latter). 
Accordingly, to achieve their goals, they direct that the financial aid program be zeroed out. Alpha and Bravo each pay $45,000. The school receives $90,000 as it always has. Transaction costs are lowered as a side benefit.
Look at what has happened to Alpha and Bravo. They have switched places. Alpha pays more than before, $45,000 instead of $40,000; Bravo pays less, $45,000 instead of $50,000. Alpha has a subsidy taken away; Bravo benefits.
Note too this is not ideological. If you object to Alpha receiving need-based financial aid to begin with, change the example to a credentials-based scholarship. So in this variation, Alpha, who has scored at the top of the range on standardized tests and been valedictorian from her undergraduate alma mater, would have been offered a $10,000 scholarship. That is eliminated with the tuition cut.
Thus, at a school that has announced a tuition cut, there must be, sooner or later, an announcement of the real cut that matches it. Absent that, the inference that can be made is that only the illusion of a cut has been presented. It is marketing, puffery, call it what you will.
The same can be said of flat-rate tuition programs more generally. It's no different than flat-rate taxation proposals. The resulting flat-rate may or may not be a better deal than varying rates, depending on a student's individual situation.
All of the above is exacerbated by the lower levels of enrollment at law schools. A school trying to balance its budget, as all of them need to do, can compensate for lower enrollment with higher tuition, or vice versa. But simultaneous downward trends on enrollment and tuition cannot be sustained without even greater real cuts to spending, financial aid, or both.
Whatever people think about the cost of higher education, it is important to understand the choices that decision makers face. Much of what looks like reform may be symbolic.

María Elena Salinas spoke at California State University, Fullerton, on Sunday, first addressing the entire CSUF graduating class and later speaking to graduates of the school's College of Communications, an audience consisting largely of journalism, advertising and public relations students.
About 37 percent of students at CSUF are Hispanic, according to the university. Salinas, a California native who was raised by immigrants, addressed the Latinos in the audience at one point during her remarks at the College of Communications ceremony, speaking in Spanish to them and their parents.
In Spanish, Salinas told the students how proud she was of their generation. Non-Latino grads started shouting ""What about us?"" according to Denise De La Cruz, a graduate who was at the ceremony. 
""Tensions worsened as Salinas began offering advice to journalism students to use the tools of media to rebut political figures such as Donald Trump,"" De La Cruz wrote in a first-person account for OC Weekly. ""That's when folks began yelling things to Salinas such as, 'Get off the stage!' and 'Trash!'""
The Washington Post reports:
 In a video, a varied response can be heard from the crowd. Salinas said: “...they blame us so much for so many things, that now they’re even blaming us, the media, for creating Donald Trump. Imagine that.” Yells can be heard from the crowd. “Isn’t that terrible? But we didn’t, right? Who did it?” she asked rhetorically. “I don’t know. Who did it? But they’re to blame.” 
Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has built his campaign on fear-mongering about Mexican and Muslim immigrants. His signature policy issue is a proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and have Mexico pay for it, which the country says it would not do. Trump has put bigotry and intolerance front and center in his campaign, and his supporters have frequently engaged in violence against protesters at his rallies.
Commencement speakers from across the political spectrum have included anti-Trump remarks in their speeches this spring.
In this video posted by The Washington Post, boos and shouts can be heard as Salinas mentions that people blame the media for the rise of Trump.
Salinas later said on Twitter that she didn't hear what people were yelling. But, she said, ""if they complained about me speaking Spanish it's sad racism is on the rise.""
One student insisted on Twitter that the boos weren't because of racism, saying that some people in the audience booed because they felt Salinas' remarks were too focused on Latino students and exclusive of others.
""It’s really sad that people can turn such a special moment into a racial war,” Salinas told The Washington Post. ""Because it seems like that is what has happened. I don’t think I insulted anyone by saying a few words in Spanish to the parents. The whole speech was directed to everyone.""
""I think the message is, we have to cool down the intolerance right now,"" she went on. ""We really do. This is ugly, what’s happening in the country.""
It's worth noting that Salinas' speech focused mainly on the CSUF students, not on Trump. And some graduates genuinely appreciated her remarks, judging by Twitter.
Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.

A summary of Cornell University’s Interfraternity Council’s findings, posted to the school’s website, now reads that “the Review Board did not have evidence and therefore did not find that any individual associated with the chapter had in fact acted on such encouragement or that the contest had actually occurred,” noting that the summary had previously “mischaracterized the findings of the Review Board, including the role of the chapter.”
Previously:
A Cornell University fraternity conducted a game in which new members competed to have sex with the most women ― and additional points were granted in the event of a tie to the contestant who had intercourse with a woman weighing the most, a school investigation revealed recently.
The university’s Fraternity and Sorority Review Board placed Zeta Beta Tau, which called its contest a “pig roast,” on probation for two years because of its misconduct last spring. The ruling also mandated that it hire a “live-in advisor” and receive ongoing education on sexual violence. Most of the chapter will also have to attend two events during Cornell’s Sexual Assault Awareness Week in April.
Ryan Lombardi, vice president for student and campus life, said in a statement the school emailed to HuffPost on Wednesday that ZBT’s actions were “abhorrent to me and antithetical to our values as a community.”
“Behavior that degrades and dehumanizes women contributes to a climate and culture of tolerance for sexual violence,” he said. “While sanctions have been levied against this fraternity by the Fraternity and Sorority Review Board, the campus community will be watching to see whether the members of ZBT ― as individuals and as a group ― live up to their public pledge to demonstrate ‘through our actions that this inexcusable behavior will not be tolerated.’”
ZBT’s Cornell chapter said on Facebook Saturday that the activities “were neither chapter sanctioned activities, nor ones that brothers were aware of. We, too, are in disbelief and even more so that these alleged actions may have been taken by those whom we called brothers.”
The post says the chapter will review its membership and expel anyone not meeting its standards.
“The allegations described are contrary to the values that Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity espouses and works in direct conflict with the beliefs and mission of the Kappa Chapter,” it wrote. “Our chapter has worked closely with the Zeta Beta Tau International Headquarters to draft and execute an action plan that addresses this alleged behavior.”

""I am proud of the progress and accomplishments achieved by the college over what will be a nine-year tenure as president,"" Rochon wrote in a statement. ""I look forward to working with the college community over the next 18 months in a constructive and collaborative way, making progress on issues of diversity and inclusion, shared governance, and decision making.""
The upstate New York school plans to launch a search for the next president in summer 2016.
In November, roughly 1,000 Ithaca students participated in a walkout after a series of racist incidents on campus, including alleged racial profiling by campus police officers and a themed ""Preps and Crooks"" fraternity party. The demonstration was inspired by similar protests at the University of Missouri, which led the university's then-president, Tim Wolfe, to resign amid pressure from students over his handling of racial tensions at the school.
Protesters in Ithaca said they were calling for Rochon's resignation because the administration had not done enough to address racism on campus. In December, Ithaca alumni joined that call.
During a November vote organized by Ithaca's Student Government Association, nearly 72 percent of 3,756 participating students voted that they had ""no confidence"" in Rochon. Weeks later, the school's faculty voted similarly. 
“The message that has come through to me in the form of the student and faculty votes has been a difficult one to hear, but I am listening,” Rochon said of the vote, according to student newspaper The Ithacan. ""I understand that many people on our campus are frustrated with the pace of change and with my own role in effecting it. I remain determined to improve Ithaca College’s culture for the better.""

133,COLLEGE,"University Of California May Outlaw Intolerance, And Experts Say It'll Violate The First Amendment",Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/university-of-california-intolerance_us_55f71809e4b063ecbfa529ec,"Free speech scholars are confused by the system's attempt to ""uphold free speech by banning free speech.""",2015-09-16,EDUCATION,"The University of California system is considering a ""statement of principles against intolerance"" that legal experts believe is likely to violate the First Amendment. 
A draft copy of the statement seeking to stamp out intolerance on the public college campuses, submitted by the UC president's office, will be considered Thursday at a meeting of the system's regents, which govern the universities. 
Experts who reviewed the proposal this week told The Huffington Post they're confused about what the statement would mean, why there is a distinction between course content and public commentary but the policy still seems to apply toward speech online, and why the universities need a new policy on this at all. 
""The problem is that it's ambiguous,"" said Geoffrey Stone, a University of Chicago law professor and First Amendment scholar. ""Reading it, it's hard to figure out what they're attempting to protect and what they're attempting to restrict.""
The proposal says:
 Intolerance has no place at the University of California. We define intolerance as unwelcome conduct motivated by discrimination against, or hatred toward, other individuals or groups. It may take the form of acts of violence or intimidation, threats, harassment, hate speech, derogatory language reflecting stereotypes or prejudice, or inflammatory or derogatory use of culturally recognized symbols of hate, prejudice, or discrimination. 
The statement explicitly says it ""shall not be used as the basis to discipline students, faculty, or staff,"" but warns the universities will ""respond promptly and effectively"" to any report of intolerant behavior. It also says it won't count toward ""course content, teaching methods, scholarship, or public commentary,"" nor will it infringe on a student's free expression. 
""My question back to them is how can a university uphold free speech by banning free speech?"" asked Charles C. Haynes, vice president of the Newseum Institute and Religious Freedom Center. ""How is that possible to do?"" 
Stone said the document is ""badly written"" and could chill free speech on campus, because if there's ambiguity, a person may say, ""Well I'll be careful about what I say because I don't want to deal with all that crap."" 
""I just don't know how it's going to be implemented,"" said Joan Bertin, executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship. ""Saying it can't be used for disciplinary measures doesn't mean it can't be used for punishment."" 
Each of the experts interviewed noted that because the University of California is public, it's considered a state actor bound by the Constitution, unlike a private school. 
""You can't be held legally responsible for thinking something or saying something that other people don't like,"" Bertin said. ""That's thought control.""
A spokesman for the UC president's office said the purpose of the statement is to ""provide a framework for prompt and effective responses to reports of intolerant behavior,"" but did not elaborate on what that meant. 
""We're taking a very important step this week with a full discussion of principles that span the broad spectrum of our UC community of students, faculty, staff and others,"" UC system spokesman Steve Montiel said in an email Wednesday. 
Meanwhile, pro-Israel and Jewish groups are criticizing the proposed language in the policy for not going far enough. 
Last week, 27 groups representing Jewish communities sent a letter expressing ""extreme disappointment and outrage"" that the proposed policy was ""watered-down,"" ""overly broad"" and failed to specifically mention anti-Semitism. The groups want UC to acknowledge their view that ""demonization and delegitimization of Israel"" is part of modern anti-Semitism. 
However, the examples provided by the UC system are reflecting situations widely decried as anti-Semitic. 
""Questioning a student’s fitness for a leadership role"" based on their race, religion, ethnicity or national origin would be an act of intolerance, the policy proposal says. This situation reflects an incident in February when members of the Undergraduate Students Association Council questioned whether Rachel Beyda, a Jewish candidate for the UCLA's judicial board, could be ""unbiased"" because of her religion. 
The policy would also target graffiti, which recalls examples of anti-Jewish markings found at UC Berkeley and UCLA's campuses. Bertin noted those are already crimes because they are vandalism. 
Free speech scholars said attempting to legislate what is hate speech could prove problematic.
""One person's hate speech is another person's religious conviction,"" Haynes said.
Haynes mentioned the possibility that a student wearing a shirt that said ""Homosexuality Is Sinful"" while quoting scriptures could be accused of hate speech. Someone might also come under scrutiny under UC's proposed policy if they displayed the Confederate flag or celebrated Black Power.
""The university is not a marketplace of ideas for ideas that people don't find offensive or intolerant,"" Haynes remarked. ""Is it painful? Is it messy? Yes, but that's the United States at our best. You'd think the last place in the United States where we would try to chill speech would be where we educate people to be part of the democratic process and prepare them to be citizens.""

Even when it seems like the snow is ready to leave, like the river might mobilize again, it changes its mind and sits back down.",2015-04-09,EDUCATION,"It's like that houseguest who won't leave, lingering around the crudités way past the point of scintillating conversation. He was a nice addition to the party at first, a bit of company while things were heating up, but then he made himself at home, kicking off his shoes and guzzling your booze without even saying ""please."" Everyone else is ready to go to bed, but this guy just doesn't get it. That is what the snow has felt like. Go home, Snow, you're drunk.
We've dealt with this unwanted houseguest for nearly four months, and still it lingers in dirty patches. Even when it seems like the snow is ready to leave, like the river might mobilize again, it changes its mind and sits back down. Finally, finally, the snow has turned to rain, prompting me to reflect on the two forms of precipitation that speak to differences between West-Coasters and East-Coasters.
In Oregon, this whole ""snow"" thing doesn't happen very often, so I was willing to humor its presence for a while. When I experienced my first blizzard sophomore year, I jumped around like a golden retriever, giddy as I waded in snow up to my knees. The white powder was cute and magical at first. No longer. Over the years I have become old and jaded and highly unenthused about jumping in piles of frozen water. The sidewalk salt has been trekked indoors and turned our floors a mottled green, like colonies of lichen on our linoleum.
""The difference between us and Stanford is that we trudge, and they ride bicycles."" Professor John Stilgoe made this pithy comment on a particularly snowy day in the middle of lecture. And indeed, people warned me about the brutal winters, questioning why I would ever want to leave the West Coast. (I wonder the same thing whenever I get a whiff of my snow boots.)
But the snow has taught me something that the misty West Coast doesn't instill in quite the same way: patience. I was ready to retire my snow boots mid-January, but alas, I had to wait. Trudging across campus is a much larger ordeal when it involves dressing for the Arctic and nearly twisting your ankle on frozen sidewalks, slowing everything else down in the process. ""Senior spring"" of college takes on a very different connotation when the city has yet to thaw by April. While rain makes the earth smell alive, makes us feel like a part of nature, snow makes us feel utterly, nakedly human -- a victim to the elements. I understand why Bostonians always seem defensive: the very sky is out to get them.
Yet at the same time, the snow can masque our worst elements in a shroud of white. It hushes the urban sound-scape, muting the clacking of footsteps to a soft shuffle. It makes the sharp edges less soft, and it keeps us indoors with our loved ones. It is a deceptively simple force that keeps our over-eager, overachieving selves at bay, if for just a few weeks longer. It causes us to slow down.
So while I can't say I prefer snow over rain, and there are certainly benefits to riding bicycles over ""trudging,"" adapting to the snow has been a curious experiment in exploring limited pathways of mobility. And when I move to New York next year, I'm sure I'll find myself missing the soft edges. But in the meantime, hurry up and melt already.

135,COLLEGE,The Intrinsic Value of Liberal Education,"Grant Cornwell, ContributorPresident, The College of Wooster",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-intrinsic-value-of-li_b_6163986.html,"A liberal education is an expansion of consciousness: with every book read, every natural or social system grasped, every theory put to the test and employed, we become persons with greater scope and agency.",2014-11-16,EDUCATION,"In my last post, I made the case that a liberal arts degree remains a great investment, in the most practical of terms: skills development, career opportunity, and lifetime earnings. The question I would like to pose today is this: Does pursuing a liberal education also have intrinsic worth? Would it be worth choosing for its own sake, aside from all of its considerable practical value?
The candidates for human endeavors worth pursuing for their own sake, even if nothing further came of them, are surprisingly few. They include endeavors or experiences like: loving another person; engaging in worship for those who practice a faith; having an aesthetically moving experience of art or music or nature; practicing benevolence, kindness, generosity, or compassion.
To this list I would add the endeavor of becoming liberally educated. The very project of seeking understanding, of considering deeply and rigorously what is currently known in one's own quest for understanding, and to advance the depth and completeness of human understanding overall, are among the most intrinsically worthy or valuable endeavors in the human scope.
A liberal education is an expansion of consciousness: with every book read, every natural or social system grasped, every theory put to the test and employed, we become persons with greater scope and agency. Every book or poem, film or equation, image or idea that we struggle to grasp expands and complicates our souls and enlarges our capacities to make meaning of the world and effect change.
Pursuing in earnest the personal and intellectual capacities that we say graduates should possess - independent thinking, integrative and collaborative inquiry, effective communication, global engagement and respect for diversity, civic and social responsibility, - amounts to a sort of soulcraft. In the very process of liberal inquiry in the arts and sciences, one creates an identity, not just with greater breadth and depth of understanding, but also with greater capacity for action, greater freedom and independence, not only to pursue one's own ends, but to influence positively the well-being of the world.
During their time on campus, no matter what their majors, students pursuing a liberal education are certain at some point, perhaps at many points, to change their minds. Reflect on that phrase: ""I changed my mind."" What a profound thing it is to change one's mind. And that is exactly why the living and learning community of a liberal arts college exists. For many, perhaps most, of our students, these changes are hard won. They are the product of toil and struggle, of progress punctuated by failure and anxiety. Because in changing their minds, in making up their minds, they are engaged in the process of becoming; they are creating an identity out of the raw materials of their studies and experiences. And that, I submit, is a profoundly valuable and worthy human endeavor. 
It is also an enormous privilege, which carries with it the responsibility to deeply and seriously embrace the opportunity and then put it to work in the world to advance the opportunities of others.
This whole package - of pursuing and advancing understanding, of making up one's mind, of becoming oneself and equipping oneself to contribute to the well-being of the world - this is what we call liberal education.
And, yes, it has inestimable value.

For years, I've watched this video whenever I needed a boost of inspiration. You see, from 2006-2008, James Franco took 62 credit-hours per semester at UCLA, which was three times the normal limit. During this time he was on set filming Spiderman 3, Pineapple Express and Milk. And he earned a 3.5 GPA. What a miraculous thing to aspire to.
But today, Franco is on Broadway for a limited engagement of the Steinbeck classic, Of Mice and Men. When I went to see his spellbinding performance as George three weeks ago, I was truly blown away. His performance only validated the hard work in what seems to be an ambitious vision in working towards becoming one of the world's few Renaissance men. It's simply inspirational and, nonetheless, I can undoubtedly say that the reason I am writing for The Huffington Post today is because of him.
I can remember the moment like it was yesterday. This past winter, I looked on my iPhone before a final exam to only discover an email from Arianna Huffington herself who wanted me to write about my underdog past for the site. I was deeply terrified of what people might think because, at the time, I just had created and launched a successful iPhone application and I didn't want people to say -- being just 18 years old at the time -- ""Who does he think he is?"" But instinctually, I never cared. I thought of James and his writing, acting, directing, paintings, as the list goes on and on. And so for that, I have immense appreciation because it's possibly been the greatest thing that's happened to me thus far. 
It's just really remarkable what the power of inspiration can have you do.
So, meeting him at what seemed to be a hectic stage door experience was really a moment to remember. While I don't want to speak too much on the moment itself, I can say that I was able to say all the words that I've wanted to say to him since I first saw the above video. So, thanks James. I honestly couldn't have thought of a better ending to this school year than meeting one of my modern-day, academic heroes.

These mini-jobs can give you a little extra income in the meantime until you snag that fabulous dream position. Try one of these methods to rake in some money!
1. Start an Etsy shop
If you're an avid crafter and have lots of time on your hands, try setting up an Etsy shop to sell your creations. Etsy offers a way for crafters to sell an array of handmade and vintage products, ranging from jewelry and fashion to art and home decor. It's free to join as a seller, and it only costs $0.20 to post an item for four months or until it's sold. When one of your items is sold, Etsy collects a 3.5 percent transaction fee on the item's sale price. Those small charges will pay off after you rake in some cash for your crafts, though!
Emily Cromwell, a student at Framingham State University, sells her artwork, jewelry, beaded projects, glass ornaments, and more on Etsy. So far, she's made more than $300! ""I sell at craft shows, too, but Etsy is a completely different experience because I am able to meet people from all across the world; it's pretty amazing!"" Emily says. ""For college students who want to start an Etsy shop, I say go for it! It is a great experience and although it does require some extra work to keep up with, it is definitely worth it and it is so much fun to do.""
What could you make? For sorority alumnae, try making and selling crafts with your sorority letters and symbols on them -- other Greek collegiettes will love them! Or, browse your Pinterest crafting board for ideas. When you have an idea, start a shop and get selling!
2. Babysit
Now that school is out for summer, parents are searching for someone to entertain and supervise their kids. Here's some great news: Because you have a degree, you're older, and you're more qualified, you can expect to make more per hour than you did babysitting in high school or college! And for education majors or those looking to work with children in the future, nannying can provide useful experience to prepare for your future interviews and jobs.
Briana Morgan from Georgia College & State University babysits for her father's colleagues. ""It's a great way to make money because you have a lot of time off and you get a taste of what parenthood could be like,"" she says.
Don't know any families with young children? Sign up for nanny search websites like SitterCity, Care.com, Nannies4hire.com, or eNannySource.com. You'll have to go through a background check, but you're likely to find lots of moms and dads who could use your help.
3. Find small jobs online
Rake in a few extra dollars by doing simple tasks! At Fiverr and Gigbucks, you can post a ""gig,"" which is simply when you advertise something you'll do for a specific price. On Fiverr, the task will earn you money starting at $5, and on Gigbucks, you can charge up to $50 for each task you do. The gigs can be almost anything! Some of the tasks are no-brainers for recent college grads, like working with social media, creating slideshow presentations, or editing others' cover letters and resumes (which we're sure you're experts at by now after reading HC!). And if you come up with gigs that are relevant to your career field, you can include the tasks you did in your portfolio or on your resume. For example, aspiring graphic designers can offer to design business cards, flyers, logos, and more. You can do more fun tasks, too! Host make-up or styling lessons via Skype, do celebrity impersonations, offer relationship advice -- anything you think someone would pay a few dollars for.
Morissa Schwartz, a collegiette from Drew University, has found plenty of success on Fiverr. In fact, in the past year or so, she's made enough to cover her living expenses and to start paying off college loans! Morissa started with singing gigs, but when she saw someone was looking for a book editor, she jumped at the chance. Since then, she's become one of the top editors on Fiverr. ""My Fiverr experience has been incredible. I've been on the site a little over a year and am already a top-rated seller,"" Morissa says. ""Students should fully embrace their talents and use them.""
Another site where you can find small tasks to do for money is TaskRabbit. If you're in a major city (like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, Austin, and more), you can apply to become a TaskRabbit and do simple chores for people. For example, you can make more than $30 doing grocery shopping or returning purchases to stores for someone. We love how simple it is!
4. Sell your old stuff
As a recent college graduate, you've probably got a lot of old stuff on your hands that you don't need anymore. Rather than throw it out or shove in the back of your bedroom closet, sell it! Try selling old textbooks on Amazon or sell DVDs you won't watch again on eBay. Depending on what and how much you sell, the money can add up pretty quickly!
Meghan Gibbons, a recent grad of Boston College, often sells clothes she no longer wears to resale stores like Plato's Closet. ""It's an easy way to clean out your closet,"" Meghan says. In addition to retail stores, you can also sell your clothes online. If you own any high-end designer items, you can sell them on Shop Hers. Or, sell some lightly worn clothes and accessories on Poshmark, Tradesy, or Shopify.
NYU collegiette Hannah Orenstein suggests selling items through your school's Facebook groups. ""My school has a Facebook group called 'Buying and Selling for Girls at NYU.' It's basically an NYU-only version of Craigslist,"" Hannah says. Students post items they want to sell, like clothing, household goods, or concert tickets. ""I've sold a few pieces of clothing through the group,"" she says. ""It's a really easy way to make some extra cash.""
You can also sell clothes on Facebook without the help of a group. Brinton Parker, a student at UC Davis, photographed items she wanted to sell and made a Facebook album that included information about the clothes and their prices, but advises to think through all the details before you do the same. ""I made a grand total of about $400, but spent a lot of it on gas when I went to drop off the purchases to Facebook friends,"" Brinton says. ""My advice to somebody who wants to do this would be NOT to offer delivery, but rather schedule times and certain days in which buyers can come pick up their items. That way, you won't spend all of what you just made!""

You may look at your resume and think that everything on it is too important to be left off. But let's get real. You're looking for an internship or entry-level job, which means you have just a few years experience.
While we're all about making your experience relevant, there isn't a single recruiter out there who thinks it's ok to have a resume longer than one page for an internship or entry-level job. You may have plenty of experience for your level, but you don't have that much experience. Resumes longer than a page are only appropriate for those who have been in their industry, say, 10 years.

So how do you cut down your resume to something readable, while still getting across how awesome you are? These easy tips will help you easily achieve such a lofty goal.
1. Only talk about relevant experience. Even if you have a ton of internship experience, it probably doesn't all need to be on your resume. Read the job description carefully and highlight keywords and skills they're looking for. Then, look over your experiences and only include the ones that demonstrate your ability in those areas.
2. Cut repetitive bullets. If you've had similar roles at different companies, you probably had some similar tasks. That's great! It means you have lots of experience in those areas. However, recruiters do not need to read ""Strategized social media content for various clients"" or ""Wrote and distributed press releases"" two or three times.
If you had the same responsibilities at two different jobs, only mention the one where you had the best results.
3. Leave out ""References available upon request."" Many people will use an entire line (and probably a blank space above it) to write this phrase. If you're struggling to fit your resume to a page, those two lines are valuable real estate.
If an employer wants references, they'll request them. It's rare for an applicant not to have a single reference available, so don't waste precious resume space with this phrase.

4. Make your name smaller. Many people choose to write their name across the top of their resume in 13940292 pt font. We get it -- it's dramatic, eye catching, etc., etc., but it's a total waste of space.
It's plenty attention-grabbing to write your name in bold, maybe one or two font sizes larger than the rest of your resume. Recruiters know they can find your name at the top of the page, so you don't need to make it so obvious for them.
5. Get rid of your objective. We've heard plenty of mixed feelings from recruiters on the objective. Some find it helpful, some say it's a waste of space. We happen to side with the latter.
Let your experience show your objective. If your experience doesn't seem obviously relevant to the position, then use your bullet points to demonstrate how those roles apply. Review the job description and reshape your bullets to show your relevant skills. Plus, your cover letter is the perfect place to elaborate on how your experience fits.
6. Reformat ""widows."" A ""widow"" is one word that has it's own line. In resumes, this is often seen in the ""skills"" section, and it's a major waste of space. Try reformatting sections like that to make the most of your space. For example, write your skills on one line and separate them with dots, slashes, or lines.
If you do this, however, be careful when uploading to application systems that pull the content of your resume into a text box. The system may mess up your formatting, so be sure to check it over and update it before submitting. 
7. Leave out your high school.
Very rarely is your high school going to be relevant to a position you're applying for. Unless you went to a very specialized high school, or you know that the recruiter reviewing your application also went to your high school, there's no reason to include it.
Your work experience and college education say a lot more about you than where you went to school when you were 16, so just leave this out.
8. Put information about each position on one line. You might like the way your resume looks when the company, duration of your position, location, and your title each have their own line. But if it's pushing your resume over a page, it's time to move things around.
Play around with ways to fit this information on one or two lines. Doing this for each of your positions will save you a ton of space.
Here's a real example of a three page resume trimmed down to one with the help of FindSpark tips and tricks.
9. Format relevant leadership experience under work experience. Having a separate ""leadership experience"" section uses more space than necessary. Evaluate your leadership and see which roles are truly relevant to the position you're applying for. Then, move the most relevant ones into your ""work experience"" section. Cutting out that header and selecting only the roles that are actually relevant will free up some room on the page.
10. Adjust your spacing. It might seem scary to have tiny margins -- it's against everything you learned in school -- but it actually makes your resume look much more impressive. Try making your margins 0.5"" and see how much space you suddenly have.
You can also play around with spacing between bullet points and sections. Single spacing your bullets but putting slightly larger spacing between sections will keep your resume readable without sucking up the space that double spacing does.
Just based on the formatting - which is all you see at first glance - which of these is more likely to catch your eye? Spacing can make a huge difference.

11. Put your contact information on one line. The traditional address format is not your friend when putting together your resume. Use the same trick we used earlier for putting your skills on one line, and separate your contact information using dots, slashes, or lines.
12. Use a smaller font. Just because 12 pt font was standard for your college essays doesn't mean the same goes for your resume. Play around with 11 or 11.5 pt font instead. You'll find that it's readable and gives you more room to play with.
13. Don't feel pressure to put three bullets. It may look nice to have at least three bullet points under each title you've held, but it's not necessary. If you didn't have three separate and relevant roles in each position, then you don't need three bullets. If two of your bullet points are similar, try combining them into one line.
14. Use bullet points that make you stand out. Forget the bullets that everyone in that sort of role performed. Only include ones where you had great results (""Increased ticket sales by 200%"") or the context is impressive (""Worked the door for a 500+ person event"").

15. Only mention self-explanatory awards. Having awards on your resume is nice, unless you're using up all your space explaining what they're for. If the name of an award doesn't obviously explain what it's for, and you find yourself adding bullets under it to explain, then just leave it out altogether.
16. Leave off irrelevant experience (yes, again!). Seriously. This one is so important, it's worth repeating. If I'm considering you for an editorial internship, I don't need to know that you were a member of your school's ballroom dance club. Unless you can clearly show in your bullets how the experience applies to the role, don't include it.
17. Submit it as a PDF unless otherwise specified. Once you've made all these changes, save your resume as a PDF. Employers want to see PDF resumes 99% of the time, so unless the application specifically says to submit it as a Word Document, you should save it as a PDF.
Nothing says ""careless"" like submitting a Word document that highlights typos, and you never know if the formatting will change on the recruiter's computer, making it look sloppy and possibly over one page. Submit a PDF so you know exactly what they'll see when they open it.
Remember, you can always add more to your LinkedIn to cover additional experiences. Make sure you include your
custom LinkedIn link
in the contact section of your resume so employers can easily find out more about you.

139,COLLEGE,"Middlebury Bans Energy Drink Sales, Citing Link To 'High-Risk Sex'",Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/middlebury-college-energy-drinks-ban_us_56d1e6afe4b03260bf770c37,A student argued that selling the drinks on campus promoted a culture of stress and bad work habits.,2016-02-27,EDUCATION,"Vermont’s Middlebury College announced this week that the campus will stop selling energy drinks on March 7 -- but the rationale behind the move has some raising eyebrows.
Myles Kamisher-Koch, a student who interns with the college's Dining Services, is behind the decision, reports student publication The Middlebury Campus. Kamisher-Koch argued at a meeting of administrators, students and faculty that beverages like Red Bull and 5-Hour energy promote a “culture of stress” and encourage bad academic habits.
Dan Detora, executive director of dining hall services, told NBC that consuming energy drinks can have potentially serious health consequences. College officials also told the outlet the drinks have been linked to unsafe behavior like alcohol abuse and ""high-risk sexual activity."" At least two students told The Middlebury Campus that this link also worries them. 
But it’s very possible administrators -- and these students -- are confusing causation with correlation. While multiple studies link energy drinks to “risky behavior,” there’s little evidence that these drinks cause people to engage in high-risk behavior. It could simply be that students drawn to risky behaviors are also drawn to energy drinks.
""It appears the kids who are heavily into drinking energy drinks are more likely to be the ones who are inclined toward taking risks,” Kathleen Miller, an addiction researcher who led a 2008 study on the subject, told The New York Times.
And some students are questioning the decision.
""There are more important things for them to address,"" Arnav Adhikari, a senior who works at a cafe on campus, told NBC News. ""And what do energy drinks have to do with sexual activity?""
Adhikari also suggested the claims of energy drinks being too unhealthy were a bit hypocritical, since Dining Services still sells plenty of fried food.
In any case, energy drinks aren’t banned altogether. Students are still allowed to drink them -- they just have to buy them somewhere else.

140,COLLEGE,Diverse Conversations: Being Transparent,"Matthew Lynch, Ed.D., ContributorAuthor of The Call to Teach and editor of The Edvocate, www.th...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/diverse-conversations-bei_b_5684976.html,Many higher education professionals often complain that the higher-ups at their institutions are not transparent in their dealings. This can have a negative impact on faculty morale and thus a devastating effect on the functioning of an institution.,2014-08-17,EDUCATION,"Many higher education professionals often complain that the higher-ups at their institutions are not transparent in their dealings. This can have a negative impact on faculty morale and thus a devastating effect on the functioning of an institution. To talk about how institutions can actually ensure transparency and counteract the problem of lacking transparency, I recently sat down with Laurie M. Joyner, president of Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio.
Transparency is, of course, a vital component of just about any professional enterprise, but it is particularly important in higher education for maintaining positive relationships within the organization structure - between higher education and those that I am referring to here as ""the higher ups"", which include administrators and so forth. Why do you think transparency is so important in this context? 
Transparency in communication and action builds trust, which is essential to effective shared governance. The strategic challenges facing higher education today, including remaining mission-driven within the context of a sustainable financial model, touch upon deeply held beliefs about institutional direction. Our academic values and tradition recognize that such critical decisions are best informed by the perspectives of faculty, staff, students, alumni and board members. A lack of transparency with any constituent group compromises our ability to form effective partnerships necessary for creating a shared vision required to move our institutional agenda forward. 
Q: In your experience, what are some of the most common problems when transparency is not maintained? What does that look like in terms of organizational function and relationships between higher education professionals and the administrators, the leaders? 
A: The most common problem is that a perception of mistrust is likely to develop making it more difficult to align priorities and efforts designed to strengthen the institution. When priorities are not aligned between faculty, administrators, and the governing board, organizational functioning may be negatively impacted. This often appears as tensions surrounding the rights and responsibilities of various groups for certain types of decisions. The challenge, of course, is that more attention and energy can become focused on who has prime responsibility for what decisions versus figuring out how to collaborate in a collegial manner to address the most pressing issues facing the institution. In some cases, relationships become strained, decision making can stall, and ultimately, organizational effectiveness is compromised. 
It's also important to note that while transparency is a healthy aspect of organizational culture, it is not necessarily sufficient for effective governance. Effective governance requires ongoing education regarding the strategic issues impacting the organization (e.g., shifting demographics, improving educational outcomes, exploiting competitive strengths, etc.) Insisting on transparency regarding key institutional metrics can build support for difficult decisions, facilitate continuous improvement, and meet the growing demand for quantitative outcome data. 
Q: Drawing from these first two questions, what would you say are the most important areas for maintaining transparency; where is it particularly important in higher education institutions? 
A: A commitment to transparency should be pervasive for the benefit of all internal and external stakeholders. This transparency can be exceedingly helpful in facilitating data-driven decisions, supporting continuous improvement, and fostering a culture of accountability regarding institutional performance at all levels. From a faculty perspective, transparency is of special importance in the following areas: institutional planning and budgeting; curricular requirements; academic integrity; academic freedom; and the selection, evaluation and promotion of faculty colleagues. 
In my experience, there are two areas that present special challenges to administrative leaders who value transparency. These areas relate to personnel and legal issues where one is not at liberty to discuss the circumstances surrounding particular decisions. It is frustrating to face community resistance that is not based on complete information and not be in a position to respond. 
Q: What are the key benefits for maintaining transparency in higher education, from an administrative and leadership standpoint? 
A: The main benefit is that it builds a culture of open communication and trust, both of which are necessary to create a sense of partnership for effectively accomplishing the important work of the institution. Given the challenges facing higher education today, it is critical to do everything possible to align our collective efforts around shared priorities as we work toward achieving our common purpose. 
An additional benefit of transparency is that it also supports the development of increasingly refined performance metrics that are useful in supporting a culture of continuous improvement across the organization while also responding to calls for greater accountability for student and institutional outcomes. 
Q: How, then, do you go about establishing and ultimately maintaining transparency in higher education institutions?
A: I think this is best accomplished by respecting the systems of shared governance involving the Board, the President and senior administrators, and the faculty. In many cases, this is easier said than done because different constituent groups have varying levels of understanding as it relates to effective governance practices (e.g., who has more or less responsibility and authority for making certain types of decisions). Given this, I believe ongoing professional development is required at every level of the organization to ensure that all key constituent groups are being supported as they adopt best practices to enhance shared governance. 
A deep commitment to transparency also supports continuous improvement across the organization and contributes to a culture of assessment and accountability. Once these elements are structured into organizational policies and practices, they strengthen and reinforce one another, ultimately improving shared governance and educational quality. 
Q: At Wittenberg University, transparency is something that you emphasize at these various levels. Beyond these basic methods and strategies for establishing and maintaining transparency, what strategies have you found to be most effective for maintaining transparency? 
A: We have worked hard to try to educate our campus on some of the core challenges facing Wittenberg. This is a critical point. There must be general agreement on the challenges if there is any chance of aligning the efforts of the campus community and Board. We have also worked very hard to communicate early and often using a range of strategies. For example, I host community dialogue sessions to discuss areas of concern and to respond to any community questions. I also distribute Board agendas to the faculty, report the actions taken at each Board meeting to all faculty and staff, and distribute an electronic newsletter to faculty, staff, and retirees every two weeks. I also provide similar monthly updates to Board and Emeriti Board members. In addition, we are working to develop more refined outcome metrics to assess progress toward key institutional goals. The intent is to eventually have all these metrics readily available to anyone interested in tracking institutional performance over time. 
Q: In your experience, when there are transparency issues and they are proving problematic, how have you proceeded to address the issues and restore transparency? 
A: In my experience, proceeding in an honest, open and authentic way is always the preferred approach with all constituencies. Further, ensuring that all elements of the governance system are working as effectively as possible and then routinely consulting with appropriate groups is essential. If there are not effective structures or systems in place, then creating meaningful structures to bring various groups together to focus on important issues can help foster understanding, enhance transparency, increase collaboration, and improve results. 
Q: Inevitably there are some instances in which administrators inherit transparency issues and that's what I'd like to focus on in this question. What advice would you give to a higher education administrator who is facing problems with transparency? What advice would you give in terms of establishing transparency and, if you like, dealing with the fallout of the initial transparency issue? 
A: Communicating about the issues in a forthright manner and establishing structures to help address difficult questions are important. I also think recognizing that shared governance is challenging and requires ongoing attention is critical. At Wittenberg, we have initiated an effort to strengthen Board governance with support from the Association of Governing Boards (AGB). From my perspective, there are few issues more strategic than ensuring that our governing Board understands its rights and responsibilities as it relates to our institution. 
My hope is to initiate a similar process internally to enhance the working relationships between our faculty committees, senior administrators, and Board. Through these parallel efforts to strengthen governance, I believe Wittenberg will be better served because our systems will become more closely aligned as we work toward shared priorities within the context of clearer expectations regarding our respective responsibilities. Ultimately, I believe this work will result in greater satisfaction for our faculty leaders, administrators, and Board members and will also foster improved institutional outcomes. 
Thank you for your time, President Joyner. This concludes our interview.

141,COLLEGE,9 Things Graduates Should Know About Post-College Work,"James Calder, ContributorMarketing Director at STRATIS IoT",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/9-things-graduates-should-know-about-post-college-work_us_5918ae42e4b02d6199b2f0c3,Over the next few weeks many students will be graduating from colleges and universities and starting that tough search for,2017-05-14,EDUCATION,"Over the next few weeks many students will be graduating from colleges and universities and starting that tough search for their first post college job. A few years ago I wrote a LinkedIn piece geared toward new college graduates entering the workforce. My views on this topic have already grown since I wrote part 1. So here are some additional thoughts on this topic.
 Be Empathetic - I am a parent of two, which has taught me to give most people the benefit of doubt at the starting gates of our work relationship. Many of us are dealing with real life issues that can not help but creep into our work lives. Some may have a sick family member, a problem in their marriage, or who knows what else. Don’t expect that everyone should be doing the same thing at the exact same moments as everyone else.  Realize That No Company Will Be Perfect - TV and movies have destroyed our ideals of the perfect job. The truth is that no company is completely perfect for every person. You need to get out there and work for multiple employers to find out what makes you happy.  Expect Nothing and Be Grateful for Anything - Don't bitch about the small stuff. If your biggest complaint is you don't like the type of tea the office provides you for free, then you have zero perspective of how shitty so many other companies are out there. If you are that tea snob get out there and find out for yourself.  Know the Company Before You Say Yes - Ask how many people have left in the past year on your interview. This is a great indicator of real culture. My current company has an insanely low departure rate. You can really learn a lot from this statistic.  Be True To Yourself - One of the hardest things for young people to deal with in the workplace is figuring out the type of person that they want to be. If you find yourself in a work culture where it is OK to bash a coworker who isn’t in the room, bash someone because they take vacations, think long and hard before you join in the bashing. When you are in this culture there is certainly pressure to join in, but people will ultimately respect you more if you don’t.  You Don’t Need To Have It All Figured Out - Not many people know what they will be doing 5 years from now, so don’t let anyone make you feel like you should know the answer to that question. Get your feet wet, gain valuable experience, and figure out what you like and don’t like in the workplace.  Ignore What Your Friends Are Making - The quickest way to get caught up in the rat race is to compare yourself with the people that you went to school with. They may have boring jobs in finance and making three times as much as you are, but who cares. You would have taken a different path if that is what you were after. Give your path a chance.  Remember That Your Actions Now Have Lasting Importance - The way that you act early in your career may seem inconsequential to the big scope of your career. In the early days, you are starting your path to who you will be as a professional. It is very easy to just join the crowd and do things that you normally wouldn’t. Don’t be a bully, don’t backstab others, don’t be an asshole, don’t be a coward. Don’t be the bottleneck on projects. Don’t talk down to people, don’t disrespect anyone and don’t take actions that you wouldn’t want done to yourself. Learn That Managing Means Up and Down - When you become a manager of people you will quickly realize that managing is a two way street. Often times you are not only managing the people in your department, but you also have to manage upwards to guide and educate your superiors. This can seem confusing at first but it is extremely important to manage expectations and achieve the goals that you set out for the company. 
Are you a recent College graduate? What types of jobs are you seeking and why? Please let me know in the comments.

142,COLLEGE,"Hey College Students, Going On A Roof Or Balcony After Drinking Is Dangerous",Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/college-students-balconies_us_55c914e2e4b0923c12bde79c,"Far too many college students are injured, or killed, falling from high places.",2015-08-17,EDUCATION,"In 2014, The Atlantic published a cover story that argued many fraternities were out of control. One aspect of the article that stuck out to several media outlets (including this one) was the fact that it included 21 instances of someone falling off a frat house. 
However, the problem of students, usually intoxicated, falling from high places and being injured or killed is not unique to fraternities.
In cases where alcohol or drugs were suspected to play a role, young people have died falling from 10 stories, from nine stories, seven stories, five stories, four stories and three stories. If you're lucky enough to fall from the second story, you might not be killed, but you could be injured. Then again, falling two floors could still kill you. 
A website called compelledtoact.com, maintained by the family of a student who died in an alcohol-related snowmobile accident, lists dozens of examples of American students falling to their death while drinking. Students have died falling from balconies at parties outside the U.S. as well. 
""It's a question of using your head -- but that's part of the problem when it comes to alcohol, is that you lose the ability to do that,"" said George Koob, Ph.D, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. ""You just have to be careful about exposing yourself to physical harm by accident because of the motor coordination and the disinhibitory effects.""
 One 2009 study looked at students ages 18-24 who died from falls over a three-year period. Two-thirds of that group, or 386 students, died from alcohol-related falls. 
The numbers may not be massive, but given that most, if not all, of these deaths are preventable, they represent a problem.
Sometimes it's not falling from a balcony, dorm or frat house window, it's falling from climbing something you shouldn't -- like the University of Arizona student who died last year climbing a tower. 
The point is that in the vast majority of these cases, the students were intoxicated, and someone could've stopped them from risking their physical safety.
Nicole May fell from a third-story balcony after drinking at a dorm at the University of California, San Diego, in 2014. She broke several bones, including all of her right ribs, and had a collapsed lung. 
""Right after my accident and I was released from the hospital, I started to hear about several different balcony and roof related falls,"" May told The Huffington Post. ""It was scary because in all of those cases the person died. I didn't.""
May still questions why no one stopped her from going out on the balcony after drinking, but doesn't blame anyone for her accident. Instead, she hopes others learn from her experience. She survived, thankfully, but it took her months to recover, as she described in a mini-documentary:
""It's natural to warn someone if they are getting too close to a ledge, but at the same time no one actually thinks that you or someone you know would actually fall,"" May said. ""I think it's important for people to care and warn those who can't make the best decisions for themselves because we would want someone to take care of us, too.""
As University of Missouri Wellness Resource Center Director Kim Dude explained, ""If somebody drinks to the point of intoxication, they're not going to consciously think, 'OK, this is a dangerous thing I’m about to do.' That's all the more reason to have somebody sober there.""
Obviously, all of these things could happen off campus, to people of any age. You don't have to be drinking to put yourself in a risky situation where you're a little too close to the edge of a balcony. But given that getting hammered has become so closely associated with the American college experience, there are more opportunities to put yourself at risk. 
So please, college students, watch out for your friends. Don't let them goof around on a roof or next to the edge of a balcony when they've been drinking.

143,COLLEGE,Liberal Arts-Professional Divide Is an Illusion,"Jonathan M. Brand, ContributorPresident; Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/liberal-arts-professional-divide-is-an-illusion_b_7688968.html,"A decade ago I might have revealed my perception that there existed a strange and even dirty little secret within the liberal arts college sector -- that many national liberal arts colleges have offered robust ""professional"" programs, but that they could not talk about them openly.",2015-06-30,EDUCATION,"A decade ago I might have revealed my perception that there existed a strange and even dirty little secret within the liberal arts college sector -- that many national liberal arts colleges have offered robust ""professional"" programs, but that they could not talk about them openly. After all, if an institution wished to be recognized as a member of the most prestigious group of ""pure"" national liberal arts colleges, it could not speak overtly of its ""professional"" programs or even of the ways in which it prepares students to succeed in a professional setting. Such a ""shallow"" message would have been anathema to the liberal arts. 
This liberal arts-professional divide assumes that the arts and sciences represent a rigid and unchanging curriculum entirely detached from professional sectors. And, never the twain shall meet. However, such a simplistic statement does not track with reality. The liberal arts have necessarily evolved far beyond classical antiquity's quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy) and trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) at every college or university. At Cornell College, for example, we now offer 54 different majors, minors, pre-professional programs, and cooperative programs. Just look at computer science as one example. Now considered a liberal arts field, how could we have even recognized it as one before the invention of a computer? What we consider part of the arts and sciences has necessarily developed over time to meet the expanding scope of knowledge and changing needs of society, and will continue to do so. 
What the research fortunately shows is that student learning has not deteriorated as additional schools have added more professionally focused programs. (By ""more-professionally"" I don't mean ""vocational."" While there is a place for vocational education, which teaches skills for a particular job, more professionally focused programs prepare students for entry into a career field or for graduate training in a particular field, such as law or medicine.) One 2014 study conducted at the University of Iowa concluded that ""growth in... critical thinking, moral reasoning, the need for cognition, intercultural effectiveness, and psychological well-being -- over four years does not differ by major at liberal arts colleges. Findings from this study suggest that a student's academic major field category -- liberal arts versus professional/vocational -- is not a significant predictor of gain on most of the liberal arts student learning outcomes."" Put another way, as long as student learning occurs within the context of the liberal arts college -- with small classes, on a residential campus, with a good portion of students' studies taking place within a broad program of liberal education, with the faculty's primary focus on teaching, learning is not being diminished as a result of the addition of more professionally focused programs.
I am not suggesting that colleges should abandon the liberal arts. Quite to the contrary: Our very mission is rooted in the liberal arts. And, society needs our students to know how to integrate and apply knowledge uniquely gained from a broad general education, which includes disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives in the arts, humanities, sciences, and social sciences. That broad education helps our students to learn how to develop ethically appropriate solutions to contemporary and enduring problems, and then communicate those solutions to others in artful and captivating ways. At the same time, it is imperative that we participate as leaders in the continued evolution of the liberal arts -- not only in the academic programs we offer, but also in our understanding of the professional preparation that benefits our students regardless of their major. 
If there is anything good to have emerged from the Great Recession, it is that it has more quickly eroded the perceived divide between the arts and sciences and professional fields. Particularly in a tougher economy, students and parents are looking for the value-added aspect of a college education. Parents rightly ask, ""Can my child get a job straight out of college, especially when I believe that I will have to pay so much for my child to get that education?"" A 2013 study by Eduventures found a disconnect between what prospective students and their families seek in a college education, and what employers look for in employees. Students identified three outcomes of college as most important: 1) in-depth knowledge and expertise in a major; 2) pursuit of a personally fulfilling career path; and 3) skills to help enter into a specific career. Career preparation is clearly on their minds. Meanwhile, the top three skills that employers seek are: 1) the ability to work in a team structure; 2) the ability to verbally communicate with people in and out of an organization; and 3) the ability to make decisions and solve problems. In fact, the study said, ""only two of the traits employers look for are in the top ten outcomes students want to achieve."" 
These results place into stark relief what liberal arts colleges have to accomplish. We must market to prospective students in a manner that speaks to those outcomes that they believe they need to achieve through college, and, at the same time, we must educate them in a manner that reflects what employers say they seek. In so doing, we must also help students and their families appreciate that what a liberal arts education provides goes above and beyond what they initially were looking for. 
Cornell College recently added two new academic programs, both of which have historically had a professional patina to them: business and engineering sciences. The faculty overwhelmingly endorsed these new programs because they play to our institutional strengths and reflect what we know is demanded by prospective students and employers alike. These new majors will also help us to further unravel the artificial divide between the liberal arts and professional programs. These offerings are not at all unprecedented, as Cornell College had a very well-recognized engineering program in the 19th century. And, many other fine national liberal arts colleges, such as Swarthmore, Smith, and Hope colleges, offer engineering. In addition, Cornell College offered various forms of a business curriculum from 1867 into the 1960s.
Leaders in higher education are increasingly recognizing that the distinction between professional fields and the liberal arts is an illusion generated by history. The liberal arts as an educational philosophy is preparation for ANY profession, and the specific skills that transcend any academic discipline instilled by the liberal arts are sought devoutly by employers in all fields. How, then, can one argue that a liberal arts education is not already a professional preparation?

You can change your personal past. You do not have to continue to live with the past provided to you by all of the agencies and institutions claiming authority to decide who and what you are and what you must try to be in your future. You can change your past and thereby give your future a direction quite different from what has been marked out for you by others. -- Hayden White 
White told our graduating class that ""the future you deserve depends on the past you make for yourself."" Not bad advice... and very much related to the view of the self and of history that Freud developed in his early years. 
Here's the review:
The introduction to Adam Phillips's new book is titled Freud's Impossible Life, and the author makes clear more than once his view that the biographer's task is an unmanageable one. Freud himself didn't make things easy, destroying a lot of evidence of his early years so as to lead (as he said) his future biographers astray. And he did this long before he had anything like the kind of résumé that would have interested biographers.
As Phillips notes, Freud had a strong distrust of the biographer's task, although he himself wrote speculative biographical studies. ""Biographical truth is not to be had,"" Freud wrote, ""and if it were to be had we could not use it."" So much of a person's life is underground, unconscious, and how we reconstruct it may reveal more about ourselves than about our subject. Phillips draws on two big Freud biographies (by Ernest Jones and Peter Gay), fully aware of their limitations.
In writing about Freud's first 50 years, the author (who is also a practicing psychoanalyst) doesn't have much evidence to go on. ""Nothing, it is worth repeating, is properly known about Freud's mother,"" Phillips emphasizes, and he is also reduced to general speculations (or silence) about his father, wife, siblings and children.
But there is also freedom in the lack of evidence; one of the reasons Freud was so interested in the ancient world, Phillips tells us, was the paucity of verifiable facts. According to psychoanalysis, ""only the censored past can be lived with,"" and we ""make histories so as not to perish of the truth."" For Phillips, psychoanalysis is part of the history of storytelling, and ""a biography, like a symptom, fixes a person in a story about themselves."" What kind of story, then, does Phillips have to tell about Freud and about psychoanalysis?
His story about the life and the work is ultimately more invested in the latter. Young Freud, a secular Jew, tries to assimilate into Viennese society while also theorizing that we humans have desires that can never be assimilated with our public, social roles. He is attracted to mentors who introduce him to painstaking scientific research (Ernst Brücke), to charismatic investigations into the irrational (Jean-Martin Charcot), to clinical work that reduces hysterical misery to common unhappiness (Josef Breuer) and finally to unstable speculation on the secrets of human nature (Wilhelm Fliess). ""In this formative period of his life,"" Phillips writes, ""Freud moves from wondering who to believe in, to wondering about the origins and the function of the individual's predisposition to believe.""
As a young doctor in training at Vienna's General Hospital, Freud asked his fiancee to embroider two maxims to hang in his lodgings: ""Work without reasoning"" and ""When in doubt abstain."" This is so telling for Phillips because work and abstinence would eventually be at the center of psychoanalysis -- both paradoxically reframed as dimensions of our circuitous pursuits of pleasure. The Freudian question par excellence: ""What are you getting out of your abstinence?""
Phillips does tell us that, as a young child in the 1860s, Sigmund regularly found himself displaced by the birth of new siblings -- six in seven years. As newlyweds in the 1880s, Freud and his wife practically repeated this history, welcoming new children -- six in eight years. Surrounded by all these little ones, the young father spent more and more time trying to understand their demands on the world around them -- how they communicated those demands and how adults responded.
One of the most important ways we deal with the demands we make and those made on us is to try to forget them. Unmet demands -- unrequited desires -- can hurt, and so in order to get back to work (and love), we may push them away. Frustration and the repression of frustration became central to Freud's thinking in the 1890s, when he was in his late 30s and his 40s. At first he tried to understand the phenomena of pleasure, frustration and forgetting at the neurological level. Then he started paying attention to how we express in disguised form the complications of our appetites -- in symptoms, in slips of the tongue, in jokes and especially in dreams: the beginning of psychoanalysis.
Now Sigmund could become a Freudian -- an interpreter who showed how our actions and words indirectly express conflicts of desire. The conflicts among our desires never disappeared; they become the fuel of our histories. Making sense of these conflicts, understanding our desires, he thought, gives us an opportunity to make our histories our own.
Freud came to this realization, indeed, came to psychoanalysis, when he acknowledged that ""our (shared) biological fate was always being culturally fashioned through redescription and recollection."" Our fate, then, resulted from how we remembered and retold our histories, and psychoanalysis became a vehicle for telling those histories in ways that acknowledged our conflicting desires. Psychoanalysis wasn't a methodology to discover one's true history; it was a collaboration that allowed one to refashion a past with which one could live.
In prose that often crackles with insights, Phillips refashions the heroic period in Freud's life, when he believed ""that making things conscious extended the individual's realm of choice; where there was compulsion there might be decision, or newfound forms of freedom."" At the turn of the century, before there were many followers and before there was an organization to control, ""Freud emerges as a visionary pragmatist.""
This visionary pragmatist understood that we could construct meaning and direction from our memories in order to suffer less and live more fully in the present. Phillips tells a story of how Freud came to that realization, making psychoanalysis as he made his life his own.

The fatal incident occurred around 2 a.m. at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, according to Hawaii News Now. 
Police said the man who died was attempting to bring inside an apparently distraught 19-year-old who had exited onto a ledge of the Hale Wainani dormitory in Honolulu out of an upper-story window. Both men fell from the 14th floor and were critically injured. They were taken to a hospital, where the 24-year-old was pronounced dead and the other man remained in critical condition Monday. 
Neither man was enrolled at the university, according to reports. 
University spokesman Dan Meisenzahl told The Associated Press a party was going on at the dorm at the time of the incident and the university is investigating whether any violations of the student code occurred. 
Since the school year has not started, only about 20 students were living in the dormitory's two towers, which usually house more than 600 students. Students arriving for the fall semester are scheduled to move into the dorms this week.
""It was a terrible tragedy,"" Meisenzahl told Ka Leo O Hawaii, the student newspaper at UH Manoa. ""We don't ever want to see anybody get hurt or killed on campus and our condolences go out to their family ... We're going to make sure that anybody who needs [help], that it's available to them and it's easily accessible.""
Suicide, according to the Jed Foundation, is the second leading cause of death among college students.

Being an educator -- helping students celebrate the mystery and explore the connections -- is, on good days, magical indeed.",2014-05-24,EDUCATION,"Following an engineering degree and a stint in the Air Force, I taught high-school mathematics for three years, before eventually becoming a university mathematics professor. Why the change of direction, and why math? Nearly four decades after that sudden tack, a young woman came to my office requesting a letter of recommendation and answered these questions better than I could have. ""Why do you want to teach math?"" I asked, curious about what motivates today's aspiring teacher and why she would choose a subject that is the bane of many. After a hesitant pause, she responded, ""Well, math is sort of like"" -- her eyes lit up -- ""magic!""
Einstein thought so too and asked, ""How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?"" That is, why does mathematics, an abstract language dreamed up in the human mind, so perfectly describe the orbits of the planets, the timbre of an oboe, or the probability of finding an electron at a particular location in its orbital? It's an amazing coincidence, thought aligning with reality. I teach mathematics because it is magic. Truth be told, all subjects are magical if approached in the right way. But I'm getting ahead of my story.
I grew up in a small West Virginia town on the border of Appalachia, belonged to a religious denomination that skated close to fundamentalism, and adopted parental values lock, stock, and barrel. The conservative value system that served me as a youngster was crushing my soul as I neared 30 underemployed, unmarried, and unaware of the wider world. Like the Grinch's heart, my worldview was at least three sizes too small. Something had to give.
I took the first tentative step beyond my shell when, eight years after earning an undergraduate degree, I entered the University of Virginia (UVA) to begin a master's degree in applied mathematics. The door then opened to challenging and rewarding work with a small aerospace firm. My employer later confessed that he'd never seen anyone grow professionally so much in such a short time. 
Sensing liberation and hungry to keep growing, I returned to UVA for a Ph.D. Unexpectedly, the move provoked an existential crisis. In retrospect, the crisis was a gift, for it forced me to do what author, educator, and activist Parker Palmer calls ""heart work"" -- confronting the discrepancy between who we are and who we wish to be. I began a painful but necessary process of sloughing off the outdated worldview to make way for a new one that was not hand-me-down. Further growth demanded a bold step. I transferred to the University of Arizona, leaving behind the familiar and comfortable.
My dominant impression during those first weeks in Tucson was of the unusually pure quality of the light, so different from the diffuse light back east that renders everything subdued. In contrast, the Arizona sky shone deep-blue, rock formations blazed in an amazing spectrum of earth tones, sunsets glowed brilliant-orange, and cacti turned radiant in the late afternoon, their translucent spines aglow when backlit. Like a houseplant too long kept in a windowless room, I thrived on that light. I'm a mountain boy of the Appalachians, and I still love their lush green, but I came to love the austere beauty of the desert Southwest and the Arizona ""mountain islands"" from whose summits one drinks in tens of thousands of square miles. I left few of Arizona's charms -- its canyons, mountains, parks, mining towns, and pueblos -- unexplored.
I became a world traveler, tentative at first, going just across the border to Nogales, Sonora, to find a good chile relleno, and later to Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city. I then spent the summer of 1984 at the University of Stuttgart, the alma mater of my advisor. Friendships established there with German colleagues persist to this day. Back in Tucson I met my wife, who was undergoing her own metamorphosis, a few steps ahead of me. She opened my eyes to the travails of Latin Americans who live under the shadow of El Norte, to the sanctuary movement, and to liberation theology. 
I recall so wistfully those four years in Tucson. It was a time of immense personal transformation. Whatever our purpose on Earth, certainly in large part it involves growing: physically, intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually. What, then, are the stimuli of growth?
In my experience, there are two primary ingredients: courage and education. Growth involves risk; it takes courage to get over the hump of risk. That means courage to leave the familiar, courage to question the status quo, courage to challenge one's -- or one's society's -- assumptions, and courage to live with ambiguity when one is in the awful yet exhilarating limbo of transition. 
Education is also key, whether formal or informal. Education forges the synapses that make possible a new and healthier mode of being. Education is the closest thing we have to a genie in a bottle. It's the magic elixir that empowers us to transcend our limitations. It liberates the oppressed, whether oppressed by the ""system"" or, in my case, by a constrictive worldview. At its best, education makes us realize that we are not alone but integral parts of an intricate web. Education helps us grasp the trajectory of where we have been through the lens of history and projects us into the future along the arc of evolution. Ultimately, education, regardless of discipline, points to the greatest truth of the oldest discipline -- philosophy -- as expressed in the three most seminal words of the Upanishads: ""That are thou."" What looks separate is not. The ""other"" is as sacred as you are, because there is no ""other."" Like the aspen grove, beneath outward appearances, we ""individual"" trees stem from the same roots.
Originally, one attended a ""university"" to study the universe and to seek one's niche in it. The best universities are still such places, where the connections that bind us to one another and to the cosmos are unveiled. Being an educator -- helping students celebrate the mystery and explore the connections -- is, on good days, magical indeed.
Today's America has lost the magic and is being torn asunder by a clash of worldviews not unlike those on either side of my personal transformation. One worldview is narrow, fearful, parochial, and ultimately destructive. The other is open, inclusive, hopeful, and healing. Nowhere is the battle for the heart and soul of America fiercer than in the field of education. Subsequent posts will explore the dimensions and stakes of this battle.
According to Ursula King of the Institute for Advanced Studies at the University of Bristol, Dave Pruett's Reason and Wonder (Praeger, 2012) ""opens up [an expansive worldview] of true audacity and grandeur that will change your thinking forever.""

I’m pretty sure this is the only phrase that can evoke glorious relief and crippling anxiety all at once. Undeniably, no matter where you are in your life; at your highest highs and your lowest lows, everything about your situation will inevitably change. It’s a mantra that can be repeated during tough times, and a lingering thought that tends to pop up in my head whenever things seem to be going too well. Constant change is a concept with which I’m still grappling as a sophomore in college, when it feels as though I’m finally comfortable in Ann Arbor and finally comfortable with myself. 
And, to be honest, I’m 20 f***ing years old – I don’t want my life to change that much. I love eating cheesy bread at 2 AM after too many rounds of tequila shots with my best friends, and, although it can be terrifying, I love the idea of having my whole life in front of me. I love living in the same house with 60 of the most wonderful girls I’ve ever met; I love my fierce independence and my ability to eat frozen yogurt three times a week and still fit into my leather skirt by Saturday night. I love that feeling when I finish a paper an hour before it’s due, heart beating out of my chest cause the last sentence is exactly how it’s supposed to be and I’ve had at least three cups of Starbucks cold brew. I love sleeping in until noon on weekends, binge-watching “Shameless,” and hiding out in coffee shops where no one recognizes me and time is measured in chapters of my current novel. Who I am right now, this really feels like me.
But then again, it always feels like that doesn’t it? It always feels like you’re as strong as you’re ever going to be until you’re forced to be stronger. It always feels like you’ve done your best until you’ve done better. And yeah, it makes my stomach drop, but I know that there are people I haven’t met yet who will change everything – there are mistakes to be made, battles to be won, pictures to be taken, hearts to be broken, jokes to be made, songs to be listened to, and dreams to be realized. Change is the only thing you can rely on; nothing about your life will stay the same, no matter how hard you try to prevent change, it will find you and it will flip everything upside down. So, I’ve learned to enjoy the view.
Change could also be a beacon of hope for those of you going through hell; the fact that your life will get better, not in a cheesy greeting card kind of way, but that it just will, the fact that it’s bound to, is something so comforting. If you’re like me, and you read “Nothing stays the same” as a sign of some impending doom, I think we need to chill out a bit. Or at least I do. Because, yeah, my whole world could fall apart tomorrow, but tomorrow could also be the best day of my life. This period of my life is pretty damn fun, but who’s to say this happiness isn’t just a fraction of what’s to come? Leave some room in your heart for the unimaginable. 
My friends and I always joke about how we’re “peaking,” about how these are the best years of our lives and we’ll never be this young again. It does seem silly, though, to believe that we’ve done all this changing, all this growth, to culminate at 20 years old. Change still scares the hell out of me, but it scares me in the same way that my future scares me – it’s scary knowing there isn’t a limit to what you can accomplish, it’s scary knowing that this is just the beginning. But it’s also absolutely intoxicating.

148,COLLEGE,Financial Sense 101: Prepare For College Before The Freshman Fifteen,"Chris Mettler, ContributorFounder, CompareCards",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/financial-sense-101-prepa_b_6535972.html,"As students look forward to attending school and experiencing all that college has to offer, they may not be thinking about how to properly manage their money. Making smart financial choices while in school will not only ease the burden of college debt, but also set them up for financial success beyond graduation.",2015-01-24,EDUCATION,"In 2013, college grads left school with a diploma -- and an average of $35,200 in college-related debt. While the costs of a college education continue to rise, post-graduation earnings remain stagnant. Obtaining a college degree is a huge financial burden to many students and their families, and it's only getting worse.
In spite of rising costs, studies indicate that a college education is still worth the investment. A 2014 study conducted by Jaison Abel and Richard Deitz found that ""... although the wages of college-educated workers have stagnated since the early 2000s -- and even declined in the years since the Great Recession -- the wages of high school graduates have also been falling."" The return on a college education remains at about 14-15 percent, ""easily surpassing the threshold for a sound investment.""
It's encouraging to know that college is still worth the investment; however, it doesn't make the financial burden easier to bear for families struggling to put their kids through school. The good news is that there are ways for students and their families to ease the financial pain and make smart choices that will help make college more affordable and set students up for financial success after graduation. Students can take their education a step further and set up a healthy financial future by making smart choices now.
Plan and Evaluate the Cost of a College Education
According to Sean Moore, Certified Financial Planner at SMART College Funding, parents and students should begin planning for college when students are sophomores in high school. ""Beyond working hard to achieve good grades and participating in extracurricular activities, it is important for high school sophomores to know their options, research potential colleges and universities, and understand the different programs that each offers. It is also crucial to begin applying for scholarships and grants during this time, as it will help them gather all the information they need to make the most informed decision."" 
Moore recommends that students and families first determine the total cost of obtaining a college education. He says that the actual cost of a college or university can vary as much as 46 percent from the advertised cost of tuition when you factor in scholarships, grants, school aid, etc; however, tuition is only part of the equation. ""At nearly all public universities, tuition accounts for between 1/3 and 1/2 (or 27 - 49 percent) of the total cost of attendance,"" says Moore. ""The difference is the cost of room and board, books, transportation, and incidentals.""
Students and their families should speak with representatives from the university's financial aid office who will be able to provide a more detailed and accurate estimation of the cost of attendance. 
Get Paid to Attend College
According to Moore, at the end of a student's junior year in high school, parents should fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This document determines what the family's expected financial contribution (EFC) is to the student's financial education. 
Unfortunately for many families, the EFC is far more than the amount of money the family has on hand -- and what they can afford -- leaving parents and students stressed about how they're going to meet the financial obligations. Luckily, families do have options when it comes to figuring out how to bridge the gap between what they're expected to pay and what they can actually pay. 
The single most important way to subsidize the cost of education is to apply for scholarships and grants that will absorb some of the cost. Moore recommends that students first apply for grants and then for scholarships. Scholarships are generally merit-based, meaning they are granted based on certain qualifications the student possesses; however, don't let that sway you from applying if you don't think you have anything ""merit"" worthy. Some scholarships are zany, meaning, you could get a scholarship just because you're left-handed, tall, or a vegetarian.
Resources like Studentaid.ed.gov, Finaid.org, and Fastweb.com are great resources for grants and scholarships. It is also beneficial to use an existing network of friends and family, who may know of opportunities through their employers or community organizations. 
In addition, schools are equipped to provide a certain amount of aid to families who may have trouble contributing enough finances to fund a student's education. Schools use the parents' EFC to determine whether or not a student qualifies for aid. If a family cannot meet the EFC, then the school may offer additional aid to help them cover the cost. 
Moore says that when shopping around for schools, one of the most important things to determine is how much money the school will provide. Some schools will meet 100 percent of a family's need, while some will only meet 20 percent. Two schools might have the same ""sticker price,"" but if one school will meet 100 percent of your need and the other will only meet 50 percent, the choice is obvious. 
Alyssa McCloud, Vice President of Enrollment Management for Seton Hall University, says that financial aid offices should be able to provide a fairly accurate picture of how much aid is available. ""We do our best to estimate costs, but we are often waiting on the state to finalize their budgets and that may change the amount of aid we can award. Schools have no control over this, but we give the clearest, most accurate picture we can of the net cost (total cost minus all grants and scholarships).""
Selecting the Right Loan Provider
Oftentimes it's hard to get a scholarship or grant if your family makes too much money or even due to the high number of applicants applying for the same scholarships. Many college students will have no choice, but to acquire some amount of student loans. Researching and carefully selecting who to get your loan through will ensure students make the best decision for their individual situation.
There are a number of sources families can rely on to help them find loans and determine the best loans for their needs. 
Choosing a loan varies, depending on the individual. The first and most important step in choosing the right loan is to perform adequate research, which can take hours of your time, but that's why we suggest you begin your college planning as a sophomore in high school. Moore recommends speaking with a financial advisor and the university's financial aid office, pursuing a Stafford subsidized loan first, and then resort to a loan from a bank if necessary. 
Before agreeing to any loan terms, students should have a clear understanding of the repayment terms of those loans. Knowing when payments will begin, how much the payment will be each month, and how much interest will be paid over the life of the loan will enable the borrower to determine whether or not, given their projected earning potential after graduation, they will be able to afford the loan. In addition, if a borrower is planning on obtaining a graduate degree, they will need to determine if their loan payments can be deferred while they continue their education. 
While Abel and Dietz's study found that the benefits of a college education are high regardless of one's major, it is still important that students pick their major carefully and consider the costs of their education and projected earnings.
Calculate the Return on Your Educational Program and School
After students understand what their financial obligations will be and the expected amount of debt upon graduation, they should find out what their salary will need to be in order to comfortably meet payment responsibilities. This may seem like a task for current college students, but this could have a direct impact on the degree they choose to pursue. 
Moore says students must have realistic expectations about choosing their ""perfect"" school versus what that school will cost, and what the earning potential will be. ""If you want to be a social worker, that's an incredibly admirable job. But you can be just as effective as a social worker coming from a state university as you can coming from a school that will cost you $60,000 a year."" 
Some fairly simple research can provide an estimate of the potential salary for any given career. According to Payscale's 2013-2014 College Salary Report, Petroleum Engineering, Actuarial Mathematics and Nuclear Engineering have the highest post-graduation earnings potential, with starting salaries of $103,000, $58,700, and $67,600 respectively. Social Work, Elementary Education and Child & Family Studies have the lowest post-graduation earnings potential, with starting salaries of $33,000, $32,200 and $30,300 respectively. 
If, after researching schools and financial options, attending a four-year university doesn't seem worth the cost of that education, students do have alternative options. Choosing to attend a community college for the first two years can be a cost-effective way to complete basic credits that can be transferred to a university. Not all credits will transfer or hold the same value at a university, so keep that in mind when considering the school you plan to attend after you get your associates degree. 
Students can also consider a trade school. Trade schools typically have shorter, less expensive programs that prepare graduates for immediate employment in certain fields such as information technology, HVAC, cosmetology, court reporting and more. 
Regardless of the individual situation, there are a number of trusted online resources that can help families make these difficult decisions. Federal Student Aid offers a wealth of information, including choosing a career, choosing a school, identifying options for financial aid, budgeting and more. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Federal Student Aid offer debt calculators that can help borrowers determine how much their monthly payments will be, including how much interest they will pay over the life of the loan. 
Start Saving and Building Credit
Once you have decided what educational path to take, your funding is squared away and you have a grasp on your return upon entering the job market, students can start planning for the fun part -- finally being on their own. 
But beyond simply getting out of their parent's house, students have an opportunity to start building their credit by making smart financial choices. Saving money and building credit may be the last thing on a college student's mind, but building a solid financial base at a young age will have numerous benefits after graduation and beyond. 
Students can make their parents a part of this process. Parents can open an account in their name or a joint account with their child as an authorized user. This will help students learn to manage money and help build their credit. Further resources for parents and students can be found on sites like College Parents and Pathway to Financial Success. 
As students look forward to attending school and experiencing all that college has to offer, they may not be thinking about how to properly manage their money. Making smart financial choices while in school will not only ease the burden of college debt, but also set them up for financial success beyond graduation.

Tinder lets users pick whether they like someone's profile by swiping right -- a swipe left means they are rejecting the person. If you were to swipe right on someone, and that person also swipes right on you, then it's a match and you can chat with them.
According to Tinder's analysis, published Wednesday on their blog, the campuses where men get the most swipe rights are religious, while public colleges are where women get more picks. Georgetown University and Brigham Young University came in first and second for most desired men on campus; Florida State University and the University of Miami host the most desired women. 
The ranking, Tinder said, is based on ""the ratio of right swipes received by students attending each university, ages 18-23 in the spring of 2015.""
There isn't a ton of crossover between the top 50. For instance, the University of Colorado at Boulder was No. 4 for most swiped right women, but was 47th for men.
The top 25 campuses where men and women are swiped right:
Campuses with Most Swiped Right Females
 Florida State University University of Miami University of Mississippi University of Colorado Boulder University of Alabama Colorado State University Boise State University Iowa State University University of Arizona University of Iowa Kansas State University Indiana University Texas Christian University San Diego State University Virginia Tech Miami University (Ohio) Clemson University Ohio University University of Florida University of Kentucky Auburn University Texas Tech University Pennsylvania State University West Virginia University Southern Methodist University

Said young professionals work long hours, so bar trivia is the one night a week when they can finally get crazy. And you, as the weakest link on the team, might be ruining that experience for them.
Here are some signs you are the weakest link on your bar trivia team.
 No one ever confirms whether or not you'll actually be there on any given week. Whenever you go to the bathroom, everyone notices the team gels significantly better. Your expertise is something like ""actors who've also released albums."" It was funny at first, but now you're really just taking up a spot on the roster. The rest of the team tries to stop you from getting drunk so you can no longer use that as an excuse for your poor performance. While most people would boast about the questions they got correct, you boast about how you steered the conversation so that someone could arrive at the correct answer. Your teammates have told you on certain weeks that no one was going to trivia. But you went anyway because you had nothing else to do. And they were all there. Playing trivia. In fact, you work with some of the people on the team, and often get the feeling that on trivia night, they don't seem very available. Some of them sit really close to you, actually. Some might say a little too close. Some might also say that your name is Jeremy. And that this is you, JEREMY. 
 And, while you're a perfectly nice human being, JEREMY, you're bringing our trivia team down. Week after week, your team is saddled with a massive ball and chain. A massive ball and chain named Jeremy. You don't even realize I'm photographing you right now, Jeremy. 
 It's this level of awareness and intelligence we've come to expect from you. Jeremy.

It was minimalist hell.",2014-05-05,ENTERTAINMENT,"Every one of us has had the following experience:
All of our lines are busy. Please hold for the next available agent. All calls will be answered in the order received.
It is certainly possible that the operators are speaking with other customers, and perhaps there really are thousands of people sitting around waiting to speak with someone. There is nothing that we can do about that.
Of course, each company has a different method of dealing with this period of time. Some tell you how long it will be before a live person will speak with you. Others just let the line go silent. Various advertisements for other products by the corporation can also be heard.  But there is one item that we, the public, can insist on: quality control over the music that is played while holding.
Over at my telephone/internet/cable company, they play one lite jazz segment over and over. I know this because there was a problem with iTunes downloading, so I called my service provider. For more than an hour I listened to this ditty, all 30 seconds of it, before it repeated and repeated. It was minimalist hell. If I put the phone on mute, I would not know if an operator really was standing by.  Does each of these firms have a music department? Is there someone in charge who asks, ""What can we do to annoy our customers even further?"" The others at the corporate table chime in with suggestions, each designed to make the caller frustrated at every turn.  Then the music supervisor says, ""I know. Let's find the most innocuous and least offensive recording possible. It needs to be just a bit catchy at first, with a little backbeat, but after that, it will cause our clients to be obsessed with the waiting period. In other words, we dare them to stick it out.""
""But what if we lose subscribers?""
""Then they will learn how much worse our competitors are.""  The decision on what style of music to play must rest with someone. Perhaps that person should be forced to sit in a chair and listen to this piece for an hour or so, just as I had done. In that time, even if they are not trained musicians, they will have enough time to take the notes down and transcribe the whole thing for symphonic band.  What can we do?
Our first hurdle is getting to a live person to explain our frustration. So I suggest that when you actually speak with someone, get a better phone number that will connect you directly, rather than having to wade through the menu. Distribute this to your friends and contacts. After that, it is only a matter of time before one of us figures out who is in charge of the holding pattern.
Here are the pieces of music that I think should be playing for this time period. If the wait will be five minutes, we should be able to listen to Dave Brubeck's ""Take Five."" Ten minutes can be assigned to Bob Dylan's ""Desolation Row."" Anything longer must be Terry Riley's ""In C"" -- simply because either could go on indefinitely.
Maybe there could be a personalized menu that would allow callers to decide what kind of music they would prefer.  All operators are busy. What would you like to hear? Press 1 for Classical, 2 for Jazz, 3 for Rock, 4 for Country, 5 for Heavy Metal, 6 for Gospel, 7 for Sinatra, or 8 for New Age. Press 0 if you prefer ""The Sounds of Silence.""
One final thought: Are there royalty distributions for usage of copyrighted material via telephone? If there are, I suggest that you propose to your provider that my recording of Copland's ""Hoedown"" is the perfect way to spend all that time. If enough of you do that, it is very possible that I may never have to use a phone again, since there will be no service on my remote island in the South Pacific.

Tomorrow is Saturday. If you don’t know what happens on Saturday morning you’re not paying attention. It’s when President 45 is left alone long enough to tweet whatever comes into his mind. And tweet he does. He says the most outlandish things. Recently on Morning Joe, Mika Brzezinski pointed out that, if a child lies in school, he gets sent to the principal.
Not in Washington, not in American politics. Apparently our president can lie, and, oh yes, name call, and, oh yes, scare the heck out of us. It’s been less than two months since his inauguration and this has been quite a roller coaster ride. And there’s no principal’s office to send him to!
The stress is palpable.
Trump may take credit for some things: the stock market rise, unemployment going down, and, yes, the extra pounds on my body. It seems that stress eating is the only thing that eases my anxiety. I teach parents and children how to deal with stress. “Breathe, relax and think positive thoughts,” I tell them. Feel the feelings, then let them go in an imaginary balloon. It’s easy: just meditate, go for a walk in nature, sing happy tunes.
Well, it’s not working for me. I can’t breathe deeply or let my mind and body relax for fear that my whole world is going to come crashing down. “Go on a news fast,” is easy to say but harder to do. I look on social media for help. Does anyone feel the same way I do?
I rented a movie the other day on iTunes to ease the pain. I rented Titanic. I thought it would take my mind off of the craziness. But it only reminded me that I feel like I’m on a ship that has hit the iceberg. Waiting helplessly for the boat to sink into the deep, cold ocean.
I’ve been listening to a channeled meditation the last few nights after I wake up in a panic. My guide says to know that everything in life is perfect. I repeat that to myself all day long. These days that’s not quite as effective as a fresh bowl of popcorn! Carbs seem the only answer.
No, my soul tells me I must trust that the universe has a plan. I must hand myself over to it and trust that all is well.
Hogwash! I need pancakes, or a bagel. That will do it!
Being an over-achiever, I like the challenge that life’s stresses bring. They motivate me. I usually do more, exercise more, go for longer walks, take on a new goal or challenge. But Trump stress has immobilized me. Maybe, because he attacked women, I feel abused.
 All I know is that I can’t move; I can’t breathe; all I can do is eat! So I blame 45 for my lack of willpower.
Every day I wake up saying, I’m not going to let it bother me. I’m going back to my over-achiever ways. But then I can’t. People I love are being hurt. My gay, black, Mexican and Muslim friends I love are in pain.
When they hurt; I hurt. It’s not just about me.
And that’s why I, and probably many others, are eating carbs to deal with the deep hurt we feel for our fellow citizens. I could cope if it was just about me, but it’s not.
Fear not! I have a solution! Mindfulness to the rescue. Here’s the deal with mindfulness, a little goes a long way. Here are a few activities I use to help me through.
1) Close your eyes, breath deeply, and relax. Imagine a light or energy moving through your head, down to your toes, and back up again. This moves energy that is blocked in the body.
2) Feelings are like a wave, they come in, crash down and subside. Imagine a wave coming over your head, down through the body, and out your feet. Breath as you see the wave and feel the feeling, then let them go. This helps a great deal with anxiety.
3) Write your feelings down. When you wake up in the morning, instead of turning on the news, grab a pen and pencil and start writing. Don’t think about what you are writing, just write stream of conscious and let the pen take over. This helps get the feelings on paper that are swirling in your head.
4) Go for a walk. Look around and note all the things you are grateful for, the sun, birds singing, new spring buds on the trees. This sounds almost too simple, but by focusing on the good in nature we begin to realize that there is a higher power. Trust that, as the spring brings rebirth, that we will get through this together.
5) Get involved. Find an organization that is doing good things in the world and volunteer your time. This helps us focus on doing, being part of a group, and helping others.
6) Be your best self. Start eating healthier, pick up an inspirational book. Watch a documentary. Start a new exercise program.
Soon, I will pick myself up, dust myself off, and get moving to do something about my anxiety, remembering success is the best revenge. Maybe in the end 45 will motivate me to be my best self, since as he says often, “What do you have to lose?”
In the meantime, I guess a few carbs won’t hurt.

Right??",2016-11-16,ENTERTAINMENT,"After the news that Steve Bannon, who has been accused of being anti-Semitic and furthering white nationalist viewpoints as the executive chairman of Breitbart News Network, was chosen as President-elect Donald Trump’s chief strategist, it seems like just about anybody is up for extremely powerful government positions.
With Trump at the helm, it seems safe to say that the worst person imaginable to handle the environment, economy, Homeland Security, etc. is each being floated to handle those jobs.
At this point, I wouldn’t be surprised if Trump was thinking about hiring Jafar as Secretary of Aladdin.
So let’s try to laugh away our impending doom by playing America’s new favorite game show ...
STUDIO AUDIENCE: ARE! THEY! BEING! FLOATED!
1. Martin Shkreli for head of the Food and Drug Administration
NOT FLOATED. But it makes sense, right? I felt this was right around the corner but there’s no way. In fact, Trump has said he is not a fan of Shkreli.
2. Linda McMahon, Former CEO of WWE and wife of Vince McMahon, for Secretary of Commerce
FLOATED! That’s right, Linda McMahon, the woman who the people of Connecticut rejected for senator twice and who helped build the WWE might be the person overseeing the growth of American business. You know WWE, right? The most profitable company in the United States? [Cough] Apple [Cough] Facebook.
3. Dana White, founder of UFC, for Secretary of Energy
NOT FLOATED! But again, this feels like it makes sense. Regardless of position, White will probably be given some sort of government clearance. High clearance. Like “Barron Trump level” clearance.
4. Sarah Palin for Secretary of Education
NOT FLOATED! That’s insane, guys. Sarah Palin isn’t being floated for Education. Sarah Palin is being floated for Secretary of the Interior! I’ve started payments on a doomsday bunker! We’re fine!
5. The Winklevoss Twins for Secretar(ies)y of Commerce
NOT FLOATED! Sorry, I gotta throw a couple jokes in here so it’s not a complete horror show. The Winklevoss boys wont be sharing a desk in D.C. And even if they did, Zuckerberg would just make a much better version of that department and get all the credit.
6. Ivana Trump For Ambassador to the Czech Republic
FLOATED! Buzz is gathering around Ivana for this position, because being a model and socialite is enough to represent the United States of America in another country. I gotta get new headshots!
7. Milwaukee Country Sheriff David Clarke for Secretary of Homeland Security
FLOATED! Apparently if you can handle Milwaukee, you can handle all 50 states. Clarke denounced the Black Lives Matter movement and said that anti-Trump protesters were “anarchists.” Despite that, he’s looking like a top contender to make the call on how the country’s citizens are protected. This game is deeply, deeply disturbing fun, right? 
8. Ted Cruz for the Supreme Court
FLOATED! One day your father is being linked to the JFK assassination and the next, your name is being thrown around to be in a position to overturn Roe vs. Wade! I’m gonna go lay face down in the shower for a couple years. 
That’s all the time we have for today. Feel free to keep playing at home every second of every day until January!

170,COMEDY,A Truly Historical Moment in Comedy,"Kira Hesser, Contributor
Stand-up comedian/writer/actor who lives in Los Angeles",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tig-notaro-breast-cancer_us_5bad045be4b04234e855cf01,"At Tig Notaro's set last night, the audience witnessed a truly historical moment in comedy. For the first time in my life, I genuinely laughed and cried at the exact same time. When she took the mike, she said, ""Thank you, thank you, I have cancer.""",2012-08-04,ENTERTAINMENT,"""Tragedy + time = comedy. But I don't have the benefit of time. So I'm just going to tell you the tragedy and know that everything is going to be okay."" 
So began Tig Notaro's set last night at her show ""Tig and friends"" at the Largo. 
Actually, that wasn't the beginning of her set. It began when Ed Helms welcomed her to the stage and she crossed over, took the microphone, and said ""Thank you, thank you, I have cancer, thank you, I have cancer, really, thank you.""
Applause gave way to reticent laughter as she explained how she had planned a set about bees flying alongside her car on the 405, but that she couldn't possibly do her ""silly jokes"" when all this was going on. And that's when she told us that three days ago, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, in both breasts. 
But she didn't just have cancer. She went on to explain that in some manic twist of fate, while her career is at an all-time high -- she is moving to New York to work on Amy Schumer's new television show, she was on This American Life -- concurrently, all these terrible circumstances have befallen her over the past three months: pneumonia made way for a debilitating bacterial infection in her digestive tract for which she was hospitalized and lost 30 pounds off of her already small frame, days after being released from the hospital, her young mother died suddenly and tragically (fell, hit her head, died), then she went through a bad breakup, and then, now, cancer. In both breasts. (""You have a lump."" ""No, doctor, that's my breast"" -- one of her most renowned bits is about someone remarking upon her small breasts).
For the first half of her set, even though she was telling the story in perfect grace and humor, I couldn't laugh. For the second half, for the first time in my life, as far as I can recall, I genuinely laughed and cried at the exact same time, bewildered at the tragedy and the remarkably calm, clever prism through which she assessed her terrible set of circumstances.
While telling us anecdotes from these personal tragedies, all along the way, she assured the audience, ""It's okay, I'm going to be okay."" At one part, when she reached a dark place wherein most of the audience could not find the will to laugh, she said ""maybe I'll just go back to telling jokes about bees. Should I do that?"" there were several ""NOs"" and one insistent loud male voice who cried out,
""NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT. THIS IS FUCKING INCREDIBLE.""
She looked genuinely taken aback, and relieved. She'd managed to make the tragic not only palatable but overwhelmingly engaging. She'd done it. 
Tig's been one of my favorite comedians for a couple of years now. I told her how much I loved her work after a set at UCB one night, and she received my words so kindly that she came towards me and gave me a hug. I've gone downtown to bars by myself and sat for hours alone, just waiting to see her headlining set. 
At the end of her routine last night, when everyone in the audience gave her a standing ovation for me her wowed, grateful, happy face blurry with my own salty eyes. She'd released her horrific story into the hearts of her fans. I'm sure we all felt like I did; we were made witness to a truly historical moment in comedy, by one of the industry of comedy's absolute greatest. 
Bill Burr followed her set, inexplicably able to make the whole audience uproarious with laughter by the end. Bill Burr then brought on Louis C.K., the surprise guest of the night, which was a shock -- it was my first time ever seeing him live -- but it was very difficult to give him my enrapt attention after Tig's on-stage confessions.
My head is still swimming around what happened last night. We all saw the ultimate embodiment of what comedy is supposed to do: deeply personal tragedies somehow transformed, with the enormous, necessary power of an open-hearted audience, into brilliantly-written truths that we'll all take home with us and keep with us as long as we'll have a sound-enough mind to remember that show. If schadenfreude is pleasure derived from the misfortune of others, we all shuffled into another corner last night, schadenfreude's cousin; we're not laughing at you, we're crying with you but trying very hard to accept this avalanche of misfortune through the more edible prism of humor.
I'm so grateful I could bear witness to what happened last night, and more than that I'm grateful to comedy and to Tig Notaro for being not only courageous enough and not only spirited enough, but for being so endlessly, achingly HONEST with all of us, the stunned, mouth-breathing strangers in the dark.

Postulated theories of extraterrestrial impact, volcanism and marine regression are being jettisoned for a much different explanation: the Crunchwrap Supreme.
 Recently uncovered fossils from the late Mesozoic Era indicate that the final generations of dinosaurs maintained a tortilla-heavy diet, rarely left home, and possessed no dignity or self-control. The remains of these once-obese reptilians were excavated from soil rich in marijuana paraphernalia. 
The only logical conclusion? Taco Bell delivery.
Paleontologists say that coprolites, or fossilized feces, suggest that carnivorous dinosaurs preyed primarily on Grilled Steak Taquitos, while omnivorous dinosaurs shamefully feasted alone on Cinnamon Twists. These unwholesome meals became more widely accessible during the Cretaceous period when Taco Bell implemented the delivery services of a tech company called Pterodactyl.
With this new evidence, the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event has been officially renamed FourthMeal. There were multiple near-extinction events that preceded FourthMeal, including the introduction of Pizza Hut Hot Dog Bites in the Jurassic period, as well as the devastating Triassic Baconator plague. 
This week Taco Bell announced plans to test delivery service, this time for humans. Paleontologists fear that this could result in another species wipeout. We should, however, consider that modern-day Taco Bells operate much differently than their prehistoric counterparts. For instance, prehistoric Taco Bells used meat from animals that no longer exist; i.e. Eozostrodon, Deltatheridium, and Jeholodens. Today Taco Bell serves food prepared with more evolved mammals, like horses.
Bottom line: Before you download the app, remember that Taco Bell's delivery service caused the dinosaurs to Live No Más.

181,CRIME,"New Stanford Criminal Justice Study Right, But Incomplete and Misleading","Franklin D. Gilliam, Jr., ContributorDean of UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, Professor of Pub...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-stanford-criminal-jus_b_5692702.html,Giving up on talking about race or facts because of the Stanford study would be a sad high-jacking of criminal justice discourse in our country.,2014-08-20,CRIME,"Criminal justice experts routinely point out a set of facts to show that the system is in need of serious reform. They frequently cite things like: incarceration rates are at an all-time high and disproportionately higher for Latinos and African Americans; the U.S. is the world's leading jailer; and too many of those in prison are convicted of non-violent crimes. The operative assumption is that these facts will help convince the public that reforms are needed.
A much-touted recent study by Stanford psychologists Rebecca Hetey and Jennifer Eberhardt seriously calls this assumption into question. In a series of experiments, the authors report that, ""...exposing people to extreme racial disparities in the prison population heightened their fear of crime and increased acceptance of the very policies that led to those disparities"". Hetey and Eberhardt conclude that ""... bombarding the public with images and statistics documenting the plight of minorities"" is unlikely to increase support for progressive reform policies. 
These findings are at once confirmatory, but also incomplete. The result is a misleading takeaway for criminal justice advocates.
Why is the Stanford study confirmatory?
First, it substantiates earlier research. In a series of experimental studies conducted by Stanford political psychologist Shanto Iyengar and myself in the late 1990s and early 2000s, we found that exposing White viewers to actual television newscasts featuring African Americans in the role of perpetrators significantly increased their beliefs that ""bad people"" cause crime and amplified their support for punitive policies such as the death penalty and ""three strikes and you're out"".
Second, in a recent paper I wrote with Adam Simon for the FrameWorks Institute we found that participants in an experimental survey study who were exposed to racialized fact patterns (i.e., disproportionate minority incarceration rates) evidenced little to no significant effect on their criminal justice policy attitudes. While our results are a little different from the Stanford study, they do support the argument that using facts about racial disparities in the criminal justice system is not a very effective advocacy strategy.  Why is the Stanford study incomplete? 
In short, it doesn't systematically consider the concept of framing. In the first instance, there is no such thing as an ""unframed"" fact. When people are confronted with a set of facts or numbers they instantly search for a frame to contextualize the data. If one is not present, people default to the most chronically accessible frame. Put differently, people use what is ""top of mind"". 
In a set of studies conducted with the FrameWorks Institute we discovered that the public's default frame when it comes to matters of race is characterized by a belief that racism is a thing of the past (for the most part), that government policies and laws have ""leveled the playing field"", and that any disparities that exist are because some groups don't adhere to fundamental American values of hard work. In short, when people are confronted with unframed information about racial disparities, they quickly default to ways of thinking about race that are not supportive of reform policies and programs (i.e. blaming the individual; blaming the dysfunctional culture of ""certain groups""). 
The introduction of values plays an important role in influencing public opinion about criminal justice. In particular, when exposed the to the value of pragmatism (e.g., it just doesn't make good sense to keep building prisons and incarcerating people for non-violent offenses), people are much more likely to support a reform agenda. More to the point, the FrameWorks experimental studies show that you can productively inject facts about racial disparities into the conversation, but only when those facts are preceded by the orienting value of pragmatism. The data suggest that sequencing information in this way significantly increased a belief that incarceration is caused by systemic factors; that remediation should focus on systemic factors; and that racial disparities should be addressed. This is a much better way, we believe, to advocate for criminal justice reform.
Why is the takeaway from the Stanford study misleading?
Many advocates have contacted us wondering if this means that you can't talk about race in the context of crime. The important question isn't whether or not you can talk about race and crime, but rather how and in what order you talk about it. We have found that starting a conversation with the American public by essentially claiming the system is racist does, in fact, dampen support for progressive reforms. But, and this is an important finding, our research also shows that starting the conversation with the values that many Americans adhere to, and then pointing out racial disparities, is effective in garnering support for progressive reforms.
In a recent piece in Slate, Jamelle Bouie argues that, ""...advocates might want to try different language (or a different approach) in their campaign to reform the criminal justice system.""
We believe we have identified a better strategy that allows advocates to both use facts and talk about race. Paying attention to values and order in criminal justice reform communications is an important framework for moving public will. By contrast, giving up on talking about race or facts because of the Stanford study would be a sad high-jacking of criminal justice discourse in our country.

182,CRIME,Former Manson Family Member Leslie Van Houten Denied Parole By California Governor,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/manson-family-leslie-van-houten-parole_us_579401ede4b0d3568f838219,"Van Houten is serving a life sentence for multiple murders, but maintains she was manipulated by Manson.",2016-07-24,CRIME,"July 22 (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown on Friday overturned the parole recommendation of Leslie Van Houten, who as a follower of cult leader Charles Manson, took part in one of the most notorious mass murders of the 20th century.
A two-member panel of California’s Board of Parole Hearings in April recommended parole for Van Houten, 66, who is serving a life sentence for stabbing to death Leno and Rosemary LaBianca in their Los Angeles home on Aug. 10, 1969.
Manson, also serving a life sentence, directed Van Houten and his other mostly young, female followers - known as the Manson Family - to murder seven people that month in what prosecutors said was part of a plan to incite a race war between whites and blacks.
“I find the evidence shows that she currently poses an unreasonable danger to society if released from prison,” Brown wrote in his decision.
Van Houten was found guilty of the LaBianca murders in 1971 and sentenced to death but that conviction and sentence were overturned on appeal. She was retried, convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 1978.
The La Biancas were stabbed to death, after which the killers used their blood to write “Rise,” “Death to Pigs” and “Healter-Skelter,” a misspelled reference to a Beatles song, on the walls and a refrigerator door.
Among the victims of the Manson Family in August of 1969 was actress Sharon Tate, the pregnant wife of filmmaker Roman Polanski. She was stabbed 16 times by cult members.
Four other people were stabbed or shot to death at Tate’s home on Aug. 9, 1969, by Manson’s followers, who scrawled the word “Pig” in blood on the front door before leaving. Van Houten was not involved in the Tate murders.
Manson is serving a life sentence at Corcoran State Prison in California for the seven Tate-LaBianca killings and the murder of another man, Gary Hinman, in July 1969.
Van Houten, who has been incarcerated for 46 years, has “developed greater maturity, independence and responsibility” and has “led a pro-social lifestyle,” Brown noted in his decision. She also earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees while in prison, where she has received positive commendations from staff, Brown wrote.
However, Van Houten has said she committed the crime because she was manipulated by Manson and that she was following his orders, claims that were refuted by Brown in his decision.
“Van Houten’s statements give the false impression that she was a victim who was forced into participating in the Family without any way out,” Brown wrote. (Reporting By Brendan O’Brien; Editing by Tom Hogue)

""They take a lot of information about people who commit crimes and see what characteristics are most associated with reoffending,"" Barry-Jester told host Alyona Minkovski.

Previously, the union had sought to have the mayor banned from the funerals of police killed in the line of duty.
The union said the request was made because of de Blasio's ""consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve.""
But there hasn't been a mayor, Republican, Democrat or Independent, in at least the recent past who hasn't been met with scorn by the powerful police union.
As former New York Times reporter David Firestone pointed out in a series of tweets: 
At least the last four administrations, spanning nearly 25 years, have faced heavy criticism from the PBA.
For his part, de Blasio has asked that all protests against the killing of unarmed African-American men by police officers be suspended until after the funerals of the slain NYPD officers.
""It’s a time to step back and just focus on these families,"" he said. ""I think it’s a time for everyone to put aside political debates, put aside protests, put aside all of the things that we will talk about in due time. In the coming days, as two families prepare for funerals and figure out how to piece their lives back together, that should be our only concern: How do we support them?""
De Blasio's police commissioner, Bill Braton said the mayor had lost the trust of ""some"" of his officers. Braton's comments came after NYPD officers turned their back on the mayor following a visit to Woodhull Hospital, where the two fallen cops were pronounced dead Saturday.
""I think he has lost it with some officers,"" Bratton said. ""I was at the hospital when that event occurred.... I don't support that particular activity, I don't think it was appropriate, particularly in that setting, but it's reflective of the anger of some of them.""
De Blasio angered the police union after he admitted that he had to train his bi-racial son to be extra careful during interactions with police.
""What parents have done for decades who have children of color, especially young men of color, is train them to be very careful when they have a connection with a police officer,"" de Blasio said. ""It's different for a white child. That's just the reality in this country.""
Previous research has shown that black men are 21 times more likely to be killed by police than their white counterparts.

185,CRIME,Job Applications To Dallas Police Surge Following Shooting,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dallas-police-job-applications-shooting_us_57933389e4b02d5d5ed1c950,The department had been struggling to recruit new officers.,2016-07-23,CRIME,"DALLAS (Reuters) - The Dallas Police Department, which was struggling to recruit officers, has seen a surge in job applications after the ambush shooting this month that killed five officers and brought global attention to the Texas city, officials said on Friday.
During the 12 days following the July 7 shooting, the department said it got 467 job applications, a 344 percent increase compared with the 136 in a similar period in June. 
That is an average of 38.9 requests per day to become a police recruit compared with an average of 11.3 submissions a day for 12 days in June. In recent months, the police department has had to cancel academy classes because there were not enough applicants.
Potential officers in the north Texas region have often opted for departments in fast-growing cities surrounding Dallas where starting pay is typically higher than in Dallas.
Dallas Police Chief David Brown put out the call for new recruits at a news conference last week where he spoke of the deaths of five officers and the actions of others to save lives at a rally in the city in the incident that marked the deadliest day for U.S. law enforcement since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. “We are hiring. Get out of that protest line and put an application in,” Brown said.
U.S. police forces have been the target of protests following the fatal shootings of black men by patrolmen in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and outside St. Paul, Minnesota, that were caught on video.
Further, the series of high-profile police killings of black men in the past two years have sparked the most intense debate on race and justice in America in years.
“It’s a shame it took a tragedy to get people to apply, but glad to see so many people willing to serve their community,” Dallas resident Ben Shaw wrote on the department’s Facebook page on Friday.

An audio tape of radio calls from the shooting has been posted on YouTube by PhillyFireNews.com, and captures the exchange between an emergency dispatcher and one of the firefighters who was shot. 
PhillyFireNews.com notes that they have posted the tape, ""to show the true bravery of the firefighter who was shot and pinned down due to the gun fire. Our thought and prayers go to all affected in this horrible tragedy."" 
In the nearly nine minute recording, one of the firefighters identifying himself as “125” tells dispatcher, ""We are being shot at, multiple firemen down. I am shot. I think it was an assault rifle."" The firefighter can be heard saying that he needs an ambulance and that he's been shot in the lower back and leg, adding that he was pinned down by his firetruck, which he crashed as the gunman opened fire. 
Lt. Mike Chiapperini, 43, a volunteer firefighter and Webster Police Department’s public information officer, and firefighter Tomasz Kaczowka, were shot and killed, while Theodore Scardino and Joseph Hofsetter were also shot, but are recovering in guarded condition at Strong Memorial Hospital.
The shooter has been identified as William Spengler, 62, a convicted murderer, who spent 17 years in prison for killing his grandmother in 1980. 
Webster Police Chief Gerald Pickering told reporters that Spengler was found dead outside the home where the shootings occurred, killed by a self-inflicted gunshot.

187,CRIME,Coroner Reclassifies A Man's Suspicious Death After HuffPost Investigates,David Lohr,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shawn-arthur-death-reclassified-louisiana_us_5ad8ebace4b03c426dac880c,An incarcerated woman said that she and her partner were involved in Shawn Arthur's death.,2018-04-20,CRIME,"NEW ORLEANS ― The death certificate for Shawn Arthur, a man who died after meeting a woman through a dating app, has been changed from “accidental” to “undetermined.”
While the reclassification might eventually push the case into a courtroom, it’s not sitting well with Arthur’s father, who wanted it changed to “homicide.”
“I am truly disappointed, but not totally surprised,” Bob Arthur, 69, told HuffPost. “Obviously the investigative facts were ignored or twisted.”
The change in classification comes two weeks after HuffPost detailed what 27-year-old Dominique Berry said about what really happened to Shawn Arthur.
A Louisiana native with a lengthy criminal record, Berry claims that she and her partner, 36-year-old Randy Schenck, drugged Shawn Arthur so they could steal his belongings in late February 2017. When the 40-year-old was found dead in his apartment shortly afterward, his death was labeled “accidental,” despite compelling evidence suggesting foul play.
The issue with the revised death classification is that “undetermined” still encompasses accidental, natural or homicide. It basically means there is no one theory that outweighs the others regarding the cause and manner of a person’s death.
A homicide classification would have required only that the coroner’s office find that Arthur’s death resulted from a deliberate act by another person, not necessarily with an intent to kill.
Berry’s account, along with other evidence uncovered by HuffPost and two private investigators working for the Arthur family – Michelle Gomez and Jane Holmes – was among the materials examined last week by the Jefferson Parish Coroner’s Office. The evidence, which prompted the involvement of federal authorities, shows how Berry and Schenck allegedly targeted men on dating apps in at least six states. Berry estimated that she and her partner, who are behind bars in Georgia in connection with another case, victimized up to 100 men.
Dr. Marianna Eserman, the forensic pathologist who performed the original autopsy, and other members of the coroner’s office were among those to sit down and review the Arthur case last week. The Arthur family’s attorney, Michael Kennedy, said he was not permitted to attend the meeting.
In a Tuesday statement to Kennedy, Eserman said the review of the case was complete and it was determined that Arthur’s death did not meet the criteria to be ruled a homicide. The pathologist said that while Berry had admitted to drugging men, she’d never said that “she remembers Shawn Arthur or his apartment.”
Yet prior to the meeting, Kennedy had provided Eserman with copies of three interviews in which Berry discussed the Arthur case. Among them was a Feb. 27 interview with HuffPost, in which Berry acknowledged going to Arthur’s apartment.
“I just called him and went to his house,” Berry said of her interactions with Arthur after they connected on a dating app.
Berry not only admitted drugging Arthur, but also claimed she was at his apartment when he passed out.
“He was snoring very loudly,” she recalled.
Kennedy said he is “outright angry” that the coroner’s office is claiming they cannot place Berry at the crime scene ― especially since police already have.
“Her fucking fingerprint was found there, so she was obviously there,” Kennedy told HuffPost.
Eserman gave HuffPost a different explanation as to why the case could not be reclassified a homicide. “We have no definitive proof under what circumstances Mr. Arthur ingested medications and alcohol,” she said in a Thursday email.
Eserman said Berry’s interviews were reviewed, but she did not respond to a follow-up email that pointed to specific statements Berry had made about drugging Arthur.
In her interview with HuffPost, Berry said she’d first attempted to drug Arthur by mixing a cocktail of prescription drugs with liquor. She said that attempt failed when the drugs did not completely dissolve and wound up stuck to the bottom of the glass.
“He didn’t drink it because there was like the ones that was still stuck in the cup,” Berry said.
The sheriff’s report indicates a shot glass with an unknown substance was found during a search of Arthur’s apartment.
In a Feb. 15 interview with Holmes, one of the private investigators, Berry said she found it was easier to mix the drugs with beer. Empty beer bottles were found in Arthur’s apartment, along with several pill capsules in which Berry had allegedly concealed the drugs.
“Of course, I drugged him,” Berry told Holmes. “I gave him two capsules of pills, then I took him to the bed, laid him down, massaged him and relaxed him, and he fell asleep.”
Berry told HuffPost that generally after drugging a victim, she’d encourage the individual to consume large quantities of alcohol.
“When they drink half a bottle of beer, that’s when you put the pill in because it won’t fizz over,” she said. “Then I’ll do like a chug game or something like that.”
Several alleged victims of Berry and Schenck told HuffPost that they have no memory of what happened from the time they consumed an allegedly spiked drink until they woke up hours later, with a bad hangover.
Dr. Gerry Cvitanovich, the Jefferson Parish coroner, did not respond to a request for comment Thursday as to whether Eserman, who is married to a detective who worked on the case, should have performed the autopsy and been involved in the case review.
The relationship between the pathologist and the detective should have been disclosed to his family, Bob Arthur contends. He said he was unaware of it until he reviewed the investigative documents.
“Mrs. Eserman should have never been the person leading on the response regarding the new information on the case,” Bob Arthur said. “There is clearly a conflict of interest on her part along with her husband, Sgt. Travis Eserman. There is always a possibility that Mrs. Eserman’s response was written to protect her husband and the other detectives for their shoddy investigation.”
The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, which reopened the investigation into Shawn Arthur’s death after HuffPost started raising questions, did not respond to a request for comment.
Whether the reclassification of Arthur’s death will have any impact on the Jefferson Parish District Attorney’s Office is yet to be seen. A spokesman for the office declined to comment on the case.
Kennedy said he plans to reach out to each of the relevant agencies to raise questions about the reclassification of Arthur’s death.
“We feel strongly that this is a homicide and will be working to provide additional information to the coroner to have that change made,” Kennedy said. “In the meantime, it is our hope the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office will take notice and look more closely at the case, so we can get justice for Shawn.”

188,CRIME,Cop In Walter Scott Shooting Reportedly Heard Laughing Afterward,Ed Mazza,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-slager-laughing_n_7052618.html,,2015-04-13,CRIME,"
Michael Slager, the South Carolina police officer caught on video shooting an unarmed black man who was running away after a traffic stop, is reportedly heard in new audio laughing about his ""pumping"" adrenaline immediately after the incident. 
The audio was obtained by The Guardian newspaper, which said it came from the dashcam of Slager's police cruiser and was recorded in the hour after he shot and killed 50-year-old Walter Scott on April 4. 
In the recording, a man the paper identified as Slager can be heard asking an unnamed senior officer what would happen next. 
""They’re gonna tell you you’re gonna be out for a couple of days and we'll come back and interview you then,"" the senior officer is heard saying in the clip. ""They’re not going to ask you any kind of questions right now. They’ll take your weapon and we’ll go from there. That’s pretty much it.”
The senior officer also urged Slager to write down his recollections of the incident. 
“The last one we had, they waited a couple of days to interview officially, like, sit down and tell what happened. By the time you get home, it would probably be a good idea to kind of jot down your thoughts on what happened,” he advised. “You know, once the adrenaline quits pumping.” 
“It’s pumping,” Slager said, laughing as he spoke. 
The dashcam caught the early moments of the incident, in which Slager pulled Walter Scott over for a broken taillight. It did not capture the shooting, which happened outside the view of the dashcam but was recorded by an eyewitness. 
A spokesman for the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, which is investigating the shooting, told the Guardian that they have not been able to independently confirm the audio but said that ""it appears"" to be Slager. 
Slager was fired and has been charged with murder.

A California man accidentally killed himself Friday night as he tried to enter his home through a window.
The body of Kyle Fortunato was found halfway through the kitchen window of his Sacramento apartment, according to CBS 13. Police say the 28-year-old was locked out, and had been attempting to climb through the window when he was impaled by broken glass. Stuck in the window frame, Fortunato bled to death.
Some neighbors found the circumstances suspicious. ""It don't seem like no accident to me,"" said one neighbor. ""I mean, I ain't no CSI, but I watch CSI.""
The incident, however, was purely an accident, say investigators. A coroner has confirmed that the broken glass of the window caused Fortunato's death, KTXL reports.
A post on Fortunato's Facebook page, apparently from his girlfriend Mariko Laurin, states, ""I don't want you to believe the vicious rumors of . . . a 'lover's spat' between us. It was an unfortunate accident that he was taken from us too soon.""
""She loved him and he loved her,"" an anonymous friend told Fox40. 
Laurin and Fortunato had an 18-month-old baby girl together.

The suspect in this Louisiana case, Felix Vail, is a mysterious figure who's been under scrutiny for other possible crimes. He had a girlfriend who disappeared in 1973 and a second wife who hasn't been seen since 1984.
Investigative journalist Jerry Mitchell of the Jackson Clarion Ledger, who's written a series of articles and a book about Vail, said ""his is the oldest possible serial killer case in U.S. history.""
Mary Horton Vail died on Oct. 28, 1962. Her husband said she fell overboard into the Calcasieu River, near Lake Charles, La. and authorities deemed it an accident at the time, KATC said. 
But Vail had taken out a life insurance policy on his wife two months earlier and the autopsy contained details undermining his assertion that she fell. There was a 4-inch bruise on the back of her neck and a scarf was shoved 4 inches into her mouth. 
Mitchell's reporting spotlights other inconsistencies in Vail's version of events.
Calcasieu Parish Coroner Dr. Terry Welke revised the decades-old determination and said she died before her body hit the water. The Calcasieu Parish District Attorney John DeRosier charged Vail with second-degree murder, which would lead to a life sentence if convicted. 
“All we wanted from the beginning was justice, and now we feel we’re getting justice,” said Will Horton, Mary's brother. “We’re going through due process that we should have gone through 51 years ago.”
After Mary's death, his girlfriend Sharon Hensley disappeared in 1973. Vail told her family that he saw her for the last time in Key West boarding a boat with an Australian couple for a trip around the world, KPLC said.
Vail concocted a similar story to the mother of his second wife Annette Craver. Vail was 40 when he met Craver in the early 1980s and she was 15. Her mother Mary Rose claimed that Vail took control of $100,000 that her daughter inherited when her father died and coerced her into signing over the deed to a home in Tulsa, Okla. 
Vail told authorities he saw Craver for the last time in September 1984 when she boarded a bus for Mexico, but Craver's family said the couple was together at least a month after that. 
A hearing on Aug. 14 will decide if Vail is eligible for a public defender, the Sulphur Daily News said.

Jeff Piotrowski was broadcasting storm coverage northeast of Dallas Saturday night when he filmed the skirmish, with one shocked Periscope viewer writing: “We almost witnessed your murder.”
The Emmy-award winning chaser was driving outside Farmersville, documenting the destruction, when video shows him passing a man holding his head on the side of the road.
“I’ve got to go back and help that guy. It looked like he was injured,” Piotrowski tells his viewers while turning his vehicle around.
“Are you hurt, are you OK?"" he’s heard repeatedly asking after pulling up to the man.
""I need to speak to an attorney, please,” the man calmly replies off camera. “An attorney!"" he shouts when Piotrowski questions him.
Some kind of tussle ensues in his car before the unidentified man is heard saying, ""This is some bulls—t dude.""
In an interview with the New York Daily News, Piotrowski claims the man lunged into his vehicle from his driver-side window and grabbed his throat. He consequently stepped on the gas, momentarily leaving the suspect hanging onto his truck.
""This guy tried to attack me with a knife!"" he’s next heard screaming in the video.
“He almost got me. Almost stabbed me in the chest,” he says while racing down the road in pursuit of a police officer up ahead.
After pointing an officer in the man’s direction, Piotrowski resumes his course along State Highway 78. Shock then turns to anger.
“Stop to help somebody and they stab you,” he fumes. “In 35 years of chasing, I’ve never had anybody try to freakin’ stab me after a freakin’ tornado. I’m mad as Hell. I wish I had my gun; I woulda shot his ass. This is ridiculous.”
Piotrowski described the man as appearing “wide eyed, like he was wiped out on drugs or something.“
In a message to his fans on Twitter after, he assured them that he was OK though a little banged up.
""I was attacked tonight I'm ok the guy was trying to kill me. I hurt my arms from fighting him off of me. [I'm] glad I'm alive,” he posted. Several hours later he announced that a Collin County Deputy had arrested “the thug” responsible.
The suspect has yet to be identified by the sheriff’s department. A request for comment was not immediately returned.
Piotrowski’s fans are meanwhile expressing sighs of relief, including some who claim they witnessed the attack as it unfolded.
""I was watching LIVE!! I was So Scared for you. I'm so glad your ok & safe. It was Horrible!!"" @tamara710 posted.
""Glad you are OK. We almost witnessed your murder on periscope. You have very clear pictures of him for the police,"" Debbie Fenelon tweeted.

194,CRIME,Documentary Star Fights Molestation Conviction,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jesse-friedman-capturing-the-friedmans_n_6090856.html,,2014-11-02,CRIME,"By Ellen Wulfhorst
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jesse Friedman, whose conviction as a teenage child molester was portrayed in the Oscar-nominated film ""Capturing the Friedmans,"" is not giving up his decades-long campaign to clear his name.
Friedman has asked a court to review evidence in his case, one of the most notorious in the history of New York's Long Island, contending that prosecutors coached and intimidated child witnesses into making false allegations. A judge could issue a ruling on his request any day now.
Friedman also alleges that prosecutors defamed him after a more recent reinvestigation of the case, and a lawsuit he filed is winding its way through the courts.
Friedman was 18 when he pleaded guilty to molesting more than a dozen boys in the 1980s at computer classes taught by his father in the basement of their home in suburban Great Neck.
The documentary on the Friedmans pieced together intimate home videos and revealing interviews, and raised questions about the police work and prosecution tactics.
Now 45, Friedman wants exoneration even though his prison sentence is behind him. Having completed parole, he is a married man who has found work as an online bookseller.
""I haven't gotten to the end yet,"" he said in a recent interview at his Bridgeport, Connecticut home. ""I could just say, 'It's time to move on,' but I don't and I'm not going to because justice for justice's sake, truth for truth's sake. It's still important.""
Controversy always surrounded the Friedman case, from the sensational details at its start to the doubts about its veracity that linger today.
The saga began in 1987 when Jesse's father Arnold was caught ordering child pornography. The investigation led to hundreds of charges of child molestation against father and son.
Arnold Friedman, an admitted pedophile, pleaded guilty and went to prison, where he killed himself in 1995.
Jesse Friedman served 13 years in prison and was released in 2001. 
NATIONAL ATTENTION
The case gained national attention in 2003 when ""Capturing the Friedmans"" was nominated for an Academy Award.
Today Friedman, thin and balding, lives quietly with his wife Lisabeth, two dogs and two cats and tries to stay out of the public eye that peered so intimately into his life.
""I'm a 45-year-old guy who sells books and goes to the grocery store like everyone else, and that's important to me,"" he said. ""I strenuously protect what privacy that I have.""
Despite Friedman's efforts at normalcy, his exoneration fight means a stream of legal filings and meetings with lawyers. His designation for life as a Level 3 violent sex offender restricts where he can work, live, worship and travel. Raising a family would be nearly impossible, making everyday events like taking a child to school problematic.
Friedman has an encyclopedic knowledge of wrongful convictions and false confession cases, many of which made headlines in the late 1980s such as the McMartin preschool case in California and the Kelly Michaels case in New Jersey.
Many unraveled or were discredited over prosecutors' questionable use of suggestive interviewing techniques, hypnosis and what is known in psychotherapy as repressed and recovered memories of abuse.
Friedman, facing 243 charges in 1988, has said he pleaded guilty to 25 counts, convinced after dire warnings from the presiding judge about the penalties he faced, that he could not get a fair trial in the intensely publicized case.
A federal appeals court in 2010 said there was a ""reasonable likelihood"" he had been wrongfully convicted but said it could not overturn his conviction due to legal technicalities.
The ruling strongly criticized the judge, prosecutors and police and suggested the case be reviewed.
It also raised Friedman's hopes of clearing his name. 
REPORT DISPUTED
But Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice declared three years later that a reinvestigation of the case ""has only increased confidence in the integrity of Jesse Friedman's guilty plea.""
Her report cited victims who affirmed their accounts, disputed recantations and blasted ""Capturing the Friedmans"" as ""selectively edited and misleading.""
""Instances of wrongful conviction are real and exist in far greater numbers than any of us would like to admit,"" Rice wrote. ""But the case against Jesse Friedman is not one of them.
""We were fully prepared to exonerate Mr. Friedman if that's where the facts led us. But the facts, under any objective analysis, led to a substantially different conclusion,"" she wrote.
Stung by the Rice report, which called him a psychopath, Friedman filed his defamation suit against the prosecutor.
Rice spokesman Paul Leonard said she was prepared to defend against it.
""We view this lawsuit as meritless and will defend zealously against its allegations,"" Leonard said.
Friedman's team of advocates, which includes ""Capturing the Friedmans"" director Andrew Jarecki, has collected recantations, eyewitnesses who say they saw nothing amiss and accusers who now say their incriminating statements were pressured and coached. They say the Rice report was biased and woefully incomplete.
In a reel of new evidence compiled by Jarecki, one accuser, now an adult, said he was never raped or sodomized. ""If I said it, it was not because it happened. It was because someone else put those words in my mouth,"" he said.
Another advocate for reopening the case is Arline Epstein, whose young son made accusations against the Friedmans. Two years ago, as an adult, he admitted he had lied to end what he found to be relentless pressure.
He told his mother that police questioning him as a child warned if he didn't say he was abused he could become a homosexual.
""The degree of the wrong is so appalling and so shocking that this just has to be addressed,"" Epstein said. ""If we don't, then the whole credibility of our system crumbles.""
Friedman's defenders want all the evidence reviewed in a hearing seeking to overturn his conviction. The hearing has been assigned to a Nassau County judge but not scheduled.

Wen Jones, a 43-year-old father of two, was leaving Juno Beach Park in Florida on May 19 when he noticed a pack of 20-year-old men harassing a boy and his father, the Sun Sentinel reported. Sensing the men were about to attack, Jones got involved.
""I couldn't stand there and watch this older guy and kid get beaten up,"" Jones said.
The three men, all athletically built, allegedly turned their attention to Jones, who was urging them to calm down. Jones described being knocked unconscious by one of the men.
""When I came to, I was being beaten in the face,"" he said.
Jones suffered a concussion that he said still makes him feel foggy months later, along with fractured bones and an eye swollen shut. The former Marine required surgery after the attack.
Tyler Dylan Carswell, Eric Michael Deiter and Cody Moore Roon are now facing aggravated battery charges, upgraded to felonies because of the severity of Jones' injuries, according to ABC News.
 From left to right: Suspects Tyler Carswell, Cody Roon, Eric Deiter
The initial victim of the men, police say, was a 14-year-old boy named Zion. The trio allegedly kicked sand in his face and called him names. While Zion waited for his father to pick him up, the men continued their harrassment. That's when Zion's father, 55-year-old Leroy Wright, got involved, asking the men to leave the beach.
""I see that these guys were not backing down, and I literally had to keep them at bay, and I looked up and here was Mr. Jones,"" Wright said in an interview with WPBF.
Roon, Carswell and Deiter ran away after the beating, but thanks to witnesses taking cell phone footage of the incident, along with getting their license plates numbers, police tracked them down.
On Wednesday, authorities arrested the last suspect in the beating after arresting the other two suspects just last week.
Wright, who has not had a chance to see Jones since the incident, expressed his appreciation.
""I feel like this man literally risked his life, because he saw a situation that was bad, that he stepped up for, when you got your average people standing around videotaping and nobody stepped in,"" Jones said. ""I am so appreciative that out of all the people that was standing around on the beach that day, that he was the only one that stood up against these guys.""
Jones said despite his injuries, stepping in and helping the boy and his father was worth it.
""I'm not happy to have been injured pretty severely, but at the same time, I ask myself, would I do it again? You know, it was the right thing to do, so I probably would,"" Jones said.

On Thursday, the U.S. attorney for D.C. charged Edgar M. Welch with assault with a dangerous weapon and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime. He initially faced a single federal charge of “interstate transportation of a firearm with intent to commit an offense” on Tuesday. Each charge carries a maximum of 10 years in prison, plus fines.
Welch had originally faced four local firearms-related charges, which prosecutors dropped on Tuesday as they moved to try him in federal court. 
The 28-year-old Welch walked into Comet Ping Pong restaurant on the afternoon of Dec. 4, armed with a loaded AR-15 and a loaded revolver, according to the federal complaint. He fired several shots inside that didn’t hit anyone, investigators said, before leaving and surrendering to police waiting outside.
Welch had been “contemplating a violent confrontation at the restaurant” for three days and tried to recruit at least two other accomplices, an FBI agent said in a sworn statement, citing cell phone records. 
Comet Ping Pong had been the subject of a false conspiracy theory that claimed Clinton and her campaign chair, John Podesta, ran a secret child sex trafficking ring in the back of the restaurant.
James Alefantis, Comet Ping Pong’s owner, told The New York Times in November that he and his employees had received “endless” death threats and other messages over the baseless conspiracy. Authorities believe conspiracy theorists targeted the restaurant after a hack of Podesta’s emails showed that he had corresponded with Alefantis about hosting a fundraiser for Clinton.
Welch reportedly explained his mission in text messages to a friend he allegedly tried to recruit: 
 “Raiding a pedo ring, possibly saraficing [sic] the lives of a few for the lives of many. Standing up against a corrupt system that kidnaps, tortures and rapes babies and children in our own backyard ... The world is too afraid to act and I’m too stubborn not to.”  
Welch already had an arrest record for drug and alcohol offenses, according to the Charlotte Observer. Shortly after his Dec. 4 arrest, he told The New York Times that he made the 350-mile drive to D.C. to get a “closer look” at the restaurant. He said he ultimately regretted how he handled it.

New Jersey police are accusing a former high school wrestling star of going on a bizarre rampage, trying to hit pedestrians on a boardwalk in a stolen buggy as if he were playing a real life game of ""Grand Theft Auto.""
Lukas Iorio, 20, was arrested Sunday on charges of carjacking, burglary, assault, driving under the influence, resisting arrest, and criminal mischief, according to CBS New York.
Witnesses at the Jersey Shore described Iorio as wild-eyed and berserk as he allegedly began attacking bystanders, CBS reported.
The rampage began after the suspect carjacked an electric buggy driven by the Beach Patrol, Police Chief Elliott A. Correia told NorthJersey.com. 
Iorio allegedly kicked out the windshield of the vehicle, overpowering the two beach officers, before mugging them. He is then accused of taking off down the boardwalk in the vehicle, swerving to hit nearby pedestrians. 
“It’s almost like he was role-playing, in, like, ‘Grand Theft Auto,' with the way he took control of the vehicle -- drove down the beachwalk aiming at people and hitting at least one person, crashing the vehicle,” Correia said.
After crashing the vehicle, police said a man went to check on Iorio, only to be punched in the back of the head by the suspect.
Iorio is accused of fleeing the scene and breaking into a residence. Inside someone else's home, the suspect allegedly repeatedly punched a 72-year-old man in the head and face, according to My Fox NY. The man's family members were able to restrain Iorio until police arrived.
The suspect's father, Tony Iorio, told CBS New York that he was sick to his stomach over the news.
""You know, he's not a criminal; he's a kid who did something really, really stupid,"" Iorio said. “The kid’s never, ever been in trouble before. The kid’s a scholar athlete. He had a 95 average at Bergen Catholic. I don’t know what happened.”

The unidentified suspect entered the restaurant, Virginia’s On King, at around noon, shot one individual and then barricaded himself inside with “several people,” officials said Thursday afternoon.
After a standoff, the gunman was shot and taken to a hospital, where he remains in critical condition, Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg confirmed.
“We tragically lost a member of our community today,” said Tecklenburg, who did not identify the victim. “This was not an act of terrorism, this was not a hate crime.”
Witnesses told The Post and Courier that the armed man had declared, “I am the new king of Charleston.” The suspect was wearing an apron and possibly carrying a small-caliber revolver. 
The suspect locked the doors in the restaurant as some 30 people were eating lunch, telling them to get down on the floor, witnesses told the Post and Courier. Some were able to escape by crawling out exit doors in the back of the restaurant. One hostage who remained with the gunman for some time was rescued unharmed, the mayor said.
Tom and Patsy Plant told the paper they were eating when the suspect came from the kitchen and said, “There’s a new boss in town.”
Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon confirmed that the gunman had a history of mental health issues. 
The restaurant is just a few blocks away from Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, where Dylann Roof killed nine black parishioners in 2015. Roof was sentenced to death in January.

That patient, it turns out, is William Gray, a reserve officer in Rigby, a city about 15 miles north of Idaho Falls. 
“The Rigby Police Department would like to thank the nurse involved and hospital staff for standing firm, and protecting Officer Gray’s rights as a patient and victim,” the agency said on Facebook. “Protecting the rights of others is truly a heroic act.”
Gray, who is also a truck driver, was badly injured in July when a suspect in a car fleeing police slammed into his truck. The suspect died, and Gray was flown to the University of Utah Burn Center. 
In the hospital, police tried to take blood from Gray, who was not under arrest and not conscious and therefore unable to consent to the blood draw. In addition, police did not have a warrant. 
Wubbels told Payne he could not draw blood under those circumstances and even got other hospital officials on the phone to confirm that policy to the detective. 
She was arrested, and eventually released without being charged. 
Payne is now facing a criminal investigation. Another officer is also on leave as the incident is investigated. 
The Rigby Police Department said it was not aware of the incident surrounding the blood draw until last week.
“It is important to remember that Officer Gray is the victim in this horrible event, and that at no time was he under any suspicion of wrongdoing,” the department said. “As he continues to heal, we would ask that his family be given privacy, respect, and prayers for continued recovery and peace.”

Five Ku Klux Klan members were arrested Saturday after stabbing three people in Anaheim, California. They were released late Sunday because they had acted in self-defense, the Anaheim Police Department said in a statement.
The brawl between KKK members and counterprotesters resulted in the arrests of 12 people, police said.
When six Klansmen arrived at the site where the rally was to be held, a group of about 30 counterprotesters had already gathered in anticipation, the APD said in a statement.
They began attacking the KKK members, Sgt. Daron Wyatt of the Anaheim police said. Two KKK members were ""stomped on the ground,"" and Klansmen stabbed three of the counterprotesters. 
The counterprotesters ""were so angry, they would have torn these folks limb from limb,"" Brian Levin, who directs the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, told the Associated Press. ""I was afraid for their lives.""
All three stabbing victims are now in stable condition, according to police.
""Even if the vast majority of our community disagrees with a particular group who visits our city we cannot stop them from lawfully gathering to express their opinions,” Anaheim police Chief Raul Quezada said Sunday. “Violence is not acceptable, and we will arrest anybody who assaults another person or commits any other crime in our city.”
The case now goes to the Orange County District Attorney’s Office for review, where judges will determine whether to file criminal charges.

Rider Gregory Locke had just boarded a train in Manhattan Saturday night when he said he found himself face-to-face with the crudely vandalized windows and advertisements.
“The train was silent as everyone stared at each other, uncomfortable and unsure what to do,” he wrote in a Facebook post. “One guy got up and said, ‘Hand sanitizer gets rid of Sharpie. We need alcohol.’ He found some tissues and got to work.”
The man’s actions sparked a ripple effect among the other riders who Locke said got up to help wipe away the graffiti.
“I’ve never seen so many people simultaneously reach into their bags and pockets looking for tissues and [Purell]. Within about two minutes, all the Nazi symbolism was gone,” Locke wrote.
Speaking to ABC 7 News, Locke said the actions of his fellow riders left him encouraged.
“Seeing a bunch of strangers stand up for, and come together to stand up for what everyone knows is right, was very heartening,” he told the local station.
“I guess this is Trump’s America,” Locke recalled hearing one passenger say.
“No sir, it’s not,” he responded in his Facebook post. “Not tonight and not ever. Not as long as stubborn New Yorkers have anything to say about it.”
Locke’s post as of Sunday morning has been shared more than 300,000 times.
Chelsea Clinton was among those who shared it to her Twitter followers, adding: “We will not let hate win. And, another reason to carry hand sanitizer.”
In a separate incident, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Sunday shared a photo of similar graffiti that had been drawn in the center of a northbound B train’s American flag.
The markings showed a swastika that had been boxed in, turning it into four squares that were inscribed with “L-O-V-E.”
“This is what New Yorkers do, we turn hate into love,” Cuomo said in statement. “That is our message to the nation and to the world. And we won’t back down. Not now, not ever.”

Dennis Thomas Murphy Jr. was arrested and arraigned in a federal court in New York City on a charge of operating a commercial vehicle while under the influence, said Nellin McIntosh, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. The complaint unsealed on Wednesday said 151 passengers were onboard the flight on April 21, 2015, and Murphy had been selected for random alcohol testing upon landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York. JetBlue officials could not be immediately reached for comment on Wednesday. Murphy, who is from New Jersey, was released on a $50,000 bond cosigned by his father and spouse. His attorney, federal defender James Darrow, could not be immediately reached for comment. A breath test showed Murphy had a blood alcohol level of .111 percent, the complaint said. A second test showed him having a level of .091 percent. ""During the walk to the onsite testing office at JFK Airport, Murphy's face was red and he was chewing gum rapidly,"" the complaint said, adding that he attributed the high ratings to the gum he was chewing. A blood alcohol level of .1 or higher qualifies as being under the influence for criminal charges, the complaint said. The Federal Aviation Administration prohibits pilots from flying with blood alcohol content higher than .04, according to the regulator's website. Earlier in the day, Murphy also piloted a flight to Orlando International Airport from New York with 119 passengers on board and his co-pilot told authorities that Murphy was drinking an ""unknown beverage from a cup"" before and during both trips, the complaint said. Murphy was immediately removed from being able to fly JetBlue planes and had resigned from the airline by May 27, 2015. He was hired by the company in February of that year. Last month, an American Airlines co-pilot was charged for drinking alcohol before a weekend flight out of Detroit. (Reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco.)

204,CRIME,"Lawsuit: Chicago Police Entered Family's Home, Shot Their Dog, Won't Explain Why","Lisa Klein, Courthouse News",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chicago-police-dog_us_56a9495fe4b0016489224a4e,The city won't turn over records about the bizarre incident.,2016-01-27,CRIME,"CHICAGO (CN) - Chicago police shot and killed a man's dog in front of his kids and they refuse to turn over records about the incident, he claims in a Cook County lawsuit.
Antonie Glasper's attorney, Torreya Hamilton, said Chicago Police Department (CPD) officers showed up at his house in August 2015 and busted down his front door while he was home with his 9-year-old and 20-year-old autistic children.
It ""appears that they had a search warrant,"" Hamilton said, although they never showed it to Glasper.
Police officers insisted Glasper let go of his dog instead of putting it in another room, and when he did they shot and killed the dog in front of the two kids in their kitchen, Hamilton says.
Glasper was arrested on drug charges but insists no drugs were in his home, and his case was eventually dismissed in criminal court.
According to the Jan. 25 lawsuit, Glasper filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with CPD and the city's Office of Emergency Management and Communications (OEMC) for ""documents, and audio and video recordings relating to the Chicago police entry and search of plaintiff's home, the detention of plaintiff and his family, the shooting and killing of this family's dog, and the unlawful arrest and prosecution of plaintiff.""
OEMC eventually sent a denial of Glasper's request, claiming ""exemptions based on an alleged open and ongoing investigation by the Chicago Police Department, which is a separate public body,"" according to the complaint.
Cook County Judge Franklin Valderrama ruled in November that OEMC's reasoning is invalid, and ordered that CPD release a police dash camera video of the shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald.
""This is the same type of FOIA exemption that was claimed by the city and rejected by Judge Valderrama in the Laquan McDonald FOIA lawsuit,"" Glasper's 6-page complaint states.
Glasper's lawsuit adds that the charges against him were dropped in October, so ""it is not likely that any Chicago police investigation concerning this incident is on-going.""
He claims CPD never responded to his FOIA request.
Hamilton said her office is ""not getting adequate responses"" to any FOIA requests and CPD and OEMC are ""being told not to respond by the [city's] legal department.""
""It's shameful,"" Hamilton added, and ""it's just the City of Chicago that's doing this."" She said that, although Mayor Rahm Emanuel has promised more transparency, these departments are ""being the opposite of transparent.""
Glasper wants a court order forcing the City of Chicago, CPD and OEMC to produce the records he asked for, which Hamilton says are part of discovery for a possible federal lawsuit.
The city's legal department told Courthouse News via email that it would look into the lawsuit, but it has not yet responded to a request for comment.

Two hikers made the grim discovery while trekking through Griffith Park Saturday afternoon, police told the Los Angeles Times.
The skull is believed to be several years old and was found in a hard-to-reach area of Bronson Canyon. Detectives had to use rope to rappel about 100 yards to reach it, KABC reported.
No additional body parts were found, according to reports. A search is expected to continue Sunday with cadaver dogs.
In 2012, body parts were found in the same area of the 4,210-acre park, which is considered the largest municipal park in the U.S.
Those remains were later identified as belonging to 66-year-old Hervey Coronado Medellin.
Medellin's boyfriend, Gabriel Campos-Martinez, was convicted last fall of strangling him and dumping his body near the iconic sign. He was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.
The Los Angeles Police Department referred requests for comment to the Coroner's Office, which could not immediately be reached.

A police officer in Texas is under review for firing a bullet into the back of a 3-year-old trained therapy dog. 
“This dog wasn't after him. This dog was just running up going, 'Hey what are you doing?' and they have a right to do that. This is my yard; this man should not have even been there. He could have killed my husband's best friend,” homeowner Renata Simmons told KVUE.
Leander police officer Woodson Blase claims that he was walking down the sidewalk Monday when the Simmons' two German shepherds charged at him, MyFoxAustin reports. The officer fired three bullets, wounding a male German Shepherd, Vinny.
To make matters worse, Blase was serving a traffic warrant at the wrong address when he encountered the dog.
KVUE explains:
The Simmons also tell KVUE they have never heard of the man police were looking for. The warrant was for a man named Bradly Neal Simpson, who is wanted for an expired vehicle registration.The address on the warrant is in Cedar Park, not Liberty Hill, where the Simmons have lived for nine years. However, Leander police say their database shows Simpson’s last known address as the same one where the Simmons live.
Simmons, a dog trainer for more than 30 years, says she and her family hope that Blase is fired for the attack. The officer remains on active duty, according to the Associated Press.
The case is under administrative review.

Camille Cosby's lawyers late on Saturday filed an emergency motion to delay her deposition, scheduled for Monday, pending an appeal of a judge's Friday ruling not to stay the proceeding. They argued the deposition would create a ""media circus"" and threaten her personal safety.
U.S. District Judge Mark Mastroianni ruled late on Sunday night that the deposition would go ahead on Monday morning. He also ordered the attorneys to court for a brief status conference ahead of the meeting.
Lawyers for the seven women fired back at the Camille Cosby's motion on Sunday, saying the claims were without merit.
""The Cosbys' last-minute filing is the latest in a series of increasingly brazen attempts to interfere with the deposition of Mrs. Cosby,"" the attorneys said in a filing. ""The Cosbys should not be allowed to indefinitely delay Mrs. Cosby's deposition by repeatedly filing what is in substance the same motion, over and over again.""
Mastroianni earlier this month ruled that Camille Cosby would have to talk to lawyers bringing the defamation suit against the comedian, although she could not be compelled to reveal private conversations with her husband.
More than 50 women have publicly accused Cosby - best known for his role as the father in the 1980s television hit ""The Cosby Show"" - of raping them, often after plying them with alcohol or drugs in incidents dating back decades.
Most of the alleged assaults date too far back to be criminally prosecuted, but Pennsylvania officials late last year charged the 78-year-old entertainer with sexually assaulting a woman in 2005, with the charges coming just days before the statute of limitations was to expire.
Cosby has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, but a Pennsylvania judge early this month rejected Cosby's request to dismiss the charges.
The Massachusetts lawsuit was filed in December 2014 by Tamara Green and later joined by six other women who contend Cosby sexually assaulted or abused and defamed them by calling them liars.

That is the story prosecutors in Illinois told in court Wednesday, when they called Brenda O'Laughlin to the stand during John Wilson Jr.'s murder trial.
""Hello Brenda,"" read the first message O'Laughlin received on October 27, 2011, a day after she found her daughter's bloodied remains inside her home.
""Love your pic,"" read another.
There was no mistaking the intent of the texts, prosecutors said. They were sent directly from 14-year-old Kelli O'Laughlin's stolen cellphone.
""She wanted me to tell you something before I killed her,"" the third message read. It was followed by, ""Think I'm in love with you Bren.""
Brenda O'Laughlin said she did not respond to the first few text messages because she was waiting for instructions from the law enforcement.
It was not until she was given an ultimatum -- ""You got 2 min to text me before I break this phone"" -– that Brenda O'Laughlin replied, she testified.
""Who are you and what do you want,"" she texted back.
The reply was prompt.
""You will know soon when I come see you.""
The messages stopped shortly thereafter.
A few days later, on November 2, 2011, authorities arrested Wilson, a 38-year-old parolee, and charged him with first-degree murder and residential burglary. 
Prosecutors allege Wilson broke into the O'Laughlin's Chicago home on October 26, 2011, with the intent of burglarizing it. However, during the course of that criminal act, Kelli O'Laughlin unwittingly walked in on him.
""[Wilson] could've just run out and left the house,"" Prosecutor Guy Lisuzzo told jurors Wednesday, according to Myfoxchicago.com. ""[But] he didn't. He confronts and stabs her repeatedly.""
Brenda O'Laughlin testified her daughter's body was still warm when she stumbled upon it a short time later. She said she touched her daughter and spoke softly to her while waiting on paramedics.
“I was trying to comfort her,” she said in court.
The girl was pronounced dead at a local hospital a short time later.
Wednesday was the first day of testimony in the murder case. 
Authorities allege cellphone records place Kelli O'Laughlin's cellphone in Wilson's custody after her death. They also claim to have DNA and other evidence that puts him at the crime scene.
According to 12newsnow.com, Wilson's defense attorney, Michelle Gonzalez, proclaimed his clients innocence during opening statements.
""It wasn't him,"" Gonzalez said, according to the website. ""There's a lot of evidence that shows it could have been anyone. And the police just focused in on him.""
The trial is expected to last two weeks.

From Cleopatra to Golda Meier, from Elizabeth I to Margaret Thatcher, from Indira Gandhi to Benazir Bhutto, women have made impressive use of political power.
For better or worse, famous political wives such as Madame Mao, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Jacqueline Kennedy have strongly influenced their husband's decisions. Whether their personal dramas followed them onscreen or offstage, women like Joan Crawford, Judy Garland, and Maria Callas left a lasting mark on popular culture. Think of some other determined women who helped redefine their gender's rights and capabilities. 
Joan of Arc is now recognized as one of the patron saints of France. Harriet Tubman, known primarily for her work with the Underground Railroad, became a strong supporter of civil rights. Susan B. Anthony helped bring the suffragette movement to the United States. Betty Friedan, the founder and first President of the National Organization For Women, is also remembered as the author of The Feminine Mystique. Helen Gurley Brown, the recently deceased Editor-in-Chief of Cosmopolitan for 32 years, told the world that it's okay for single women to have sex and enjoy it.
As we mark the 50th anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's death, it's also important to remember sex symbols like Helen of Troy (whose face was supposed to have launched a thousand ships), Lillian Russell, Jean Harlow, and Elizabeth Taylor. Clara Bow may have been known as the ""It"" girl, but the wit and wisdom of Mae West still brings a smile to our faces.
What do these women have in common? They're all dead, and yet they continue to haunt us from the grave.  * * * * * * * * * *
Written in 1941 by Noel Coward, Blithe Spirit was successfully adapted for the silver screen in 1945 with a cast headed by Rex Harrison, Margaret Rutherford, Kay Hammond, and Constance Cummings. In 1964, the ghostly romp was transformed into a Broadway musical directed by Noel Coward. High Spirits starred Beatrice Lillie, Tammy Grimes, Edward Woodward, and Louise Troy. The young Christopher Walken was one of the show's dancers.
This summer, the California Shakespeare Theater is performing Coward's play with a cast mostly recruited from the American Conservatory Theatre. Having only seen High Spirits in the past, I was especially looking forward to this production (I always find it fascinating to see how a musical's songs were inspired by moments or lines in the original play).
Under the crisp direction of Mark Rucker, Blithe Spirit (which Coward claimed to have written over the course of five days while on vacation) has lost absolutely none of its ability to charm and convulse an audience with laughter. Annie Smart's handsome, expansive set is beautifully rigged for the play's final moments (during which all hell breaks loose).
As Charles Condomine, Anthony Fusco was a devilishly dapper mystery writer hoping do gain some insight into the language of spiritualists by inviting the village kook, Madame Arcati (Domenique Lozano), to a dinner party which is to be followed by a séance. As the play begins, the Condomines are merrily congratulating themselves on being more mature than younger lovers, even if Ruth likes to bully her husband and tries to nail him with questions that border on the old ""Does this dress make me look fat?"" trick.

After Dr. Bradman (Kevin Rolston) and his wife (Melissa Smith) arrive, the only other person visible to the audience is Edith (Rebekah Brockman), the Condomines' easily agitated maid whose determination and speed (habits acquired during her stint in the Royal Navy) are decidedly at odds with the relaxed pace of life in suburban Kent (often referred to as ""The Garden of England"").

Both Charles and his spouse, Ruth (Rene Augesen), are on their second marriages. Keenly aware of the compromises one makes during the second lap around the relationship racetrack, they are thrown for a loop when Madame Arcati (who prefers not to eat red meat before a séance) manages to summon up the ghost of Charles's first wife, Elvira (Jessica Kitchens). For those who can see her, Elvira is very much a sight for sore eyes.

Elvira always had a knack for causing trouble. Moody, mischievous, and magnificently mercurial, she was the embodiment of vanity, flirtatiousness, lust, and temptation while alive.
Because Elvira's ghost is only visible to Charles, Ruth is quick to take umbrage at her husband's perceived insults. But all Charles is really doing is trying to maintain a conversation with his first wife's ghost while his second wife pouts and sulks over his supposed insensitivity.

Elvira has, of course, returned on a mission to bring Charles back to the ""other side"" where she's built herself an army of famous and quite fascinating friends. Here's Tammy Grimes singing ""Home Sweet Heaven"" from the original Broadway cast album of High Spirits. 
With so many of today's new plays being carefully workshopped prior to their world premieres, it's hard to believe that Noel Coward wrote Blithe Spirit in five days during World War II. The play initially ran for 1,997 performances and has been a steady source of entertainment for 70 years!

There is such beauty and craft in the structure of Coward's script that it often seems to be more of a study in how jealousy and insecurity can ruin a marriage than an attempt to get an audience to lighten up with regard to how they deal with death. California Shakespeare Theatre's production is a first-rate gem. Performances of Blithe Spirit continue at the Bruns Amphitheatre in Orinda through September 2.

As long as we're talking about women who haunt us, mention should be made of the Kinsey Sicks, the indefatigable dragapella barbershop quartet that recently brought Electile Dysfunction to San Francisco's Rrazz Room before heading to Tampa to terrorize those delegates to the 2012 Republican National Convention who failed to score time with Lisa Ann (the star of Who's Naylin Palin?).
 
While the Kinsey Sicks have their work cut out for them, there's just so much these girls can do. There's a good chance that Trixie, Rachel, Winnie, and Trampolina will be forced to massage lots of throbbing members of the Republican party in order to achieve multiple orgasmic tax releases. They can try to appeal to moderates by singing ""Love Child: Politician Edition"" or attempt to woo the genuine crazies with their rendition of ""Vote for Me (I Wasn't Born in Kenya).""
Sure, they can try to woo faithful conservatives with their new song ""Eliminate the Schools"" (sung to the tune of Gilbert & Sullivan's ""Three Little Maids"") and remind Tea Party delegates that no one helped the Kinsey Sicks build their performing career (they did it ""Yahweh""). 

While I'm sure that Rachel will have no problem grabbing Paul Ryan by his ears and barking out orders to him, it's hard to tell which song will be best suited for greeting the Republican nominees:
""Hello, Young Lovers"" ""T'aint It Love?"" ""Sikh to Sheikh"" (sung to the tune of Irving Berlin's 1935 hit song, ""Cheek to Cheek"").
 
What's interesting about Electile Dysfunction (which was commissioned by Theatre J in Washington, D.C.) is how it revives some old Kinsey standards (""BP is Creepy,"" and ""Sell the Poor"") while giving new life to some of their greatest hits. Using ""He's A Sheep-Fucking Guy"" for a curtain call never fails to bring down the house.
If Ann Romney still thinks that it's her family's turn to inhabit the White House, she's got another thing coming!

Even with paying the dreaded regular ticket price (no student discounts on this go 'round), I was more than satisfied by 168 minutes of 'the enword', guns, blood, pre-klanish costumery, period drama, retribution and romance. In light of the current re-hash of the un-lovability of black women, I consider this a new kind of chick flick. It's a film that in spite of, or maybe because of the veracity of its violence, imagines black womanhood™ beyond the superhuman stoic into a paradigm of the pretty.
To be sure, Django Unchained is an American love story. Set against a backdrop of an equally American institution, the revenge genre only makes sense in the context of passionate love -- it becomes fuel for the hero (or heroine), moving them irrevocably towards retribution. Plus, it's been a long time since I've seen a black American princess onscreen, never, if you omit examples in the comedic vein. But here we meet Broomhilde, a bilingual, two-time runaway slave whose prince charming is already her husband. Kerry Washington is pitch perfect casting, having established herself as a formidable talent on both the big and small screen, while offering the public a sepia starlet to study on the red carpet. A graduate of The Spence School, Ms. Washington manages to insert subtle refinement into the character, making all of those seemingly oppositional details believable parts of a whole. Initially, we see Django's ladylove through apparitions of memory: dressed in dull cottons, swathed yellow satin or clothed in the waters of an alpine lake, most of Broomhilde's actual dialogue consists of screaming and crying -- pointing directly to the unspeakable nature of slavery itself. But we are never left to wonder about her role as a cherished human being. She is a woman whose charms are worth risking life and limb to defend.
It is the preservation of white womanhood™, an enduring trope of American cinema, that serves as a knowing counterpoint to Mr. Tarantino's vision. Broomhilde's swoon-to-faint is probably the first in cinematic history to feature a black woman. I selfishly enjoyed the opportunity to not be 'capable' to be overwhelmed to unconsciousness, to project myself into a fictional space that didn't demand that I 'keep it together'. I relished the avatar of female blackness as the princess, a damsel in distress, transmogrification not required. 
This is why I heart Quentin Tarantino. He is obviously a romantic.

She may be right this time. Chuck Close's signature portraits writ large occupy the elegant space like old friends, one gallery devoted to recent work, the other to earlier work, like a graphic self-portrait on a simple grid from 1974, bespectacled with flowing hair. His new self-portrait on tapestry hung alongside Lou (as in Reed), Lucas (Samaras) and Roy (Lichtenstein) is a rich evocation of himself, bald. You can feel every wrinkle. In a colorful dashiki print suit, the artist wheeled in on his customized chair, designed, he once told me at an exhibition at Pace Gallery, so that he can crane up and chat at cocktail parties, eye to eye. Eying the tattooed visitor who asked him to pose for a photo, Close said he wanted a tattoo, the image on signs for handicapped parking.

One of our supreme portraitists, he may be our most gregarious. Close has lots of friends: an A-list of artists came for cocktails at the Riggio Sculpture Garden, among them Lou Reed (the rocker's done photography), Cindy Sherman, Eric Fishl, April Gornik, Ross Blechner, Judy Hudson, in addition to writers Robert Storr, author of the exhibition essay, and Phoebe Hoban, who has just completed her biography of Lucien Freud. Alec Baldwin and Hilaria, one week away from her due date, joined the party, among the basalt and granite works by Isamu Noguchis, and others: Richard Serra, Joel Shapiro, Willem DeKooning, Niki de Saint Phalle on the vast grounds; the house's interiors were also open: a modest Lichtenstein hung in the den where guests sipped white wine. Work by Robert Irwin and Donald Judd adorned the pool house. Sienna, one of Chuck Close's recent subjects, her head larger than life on Hahnemuhle rag paper, told me Chuck likes to tell the story of James Turrell spinning him around in his chair to get the full effect of his neon light art in the reconfigured Guggenheim Museum's rotunda.
Another guest, Tristana Waltz, donated her East Hampton house and garden for the Guild Hall annual Garden as Art tour, to take place on August 24. A kid's fantasy, the grounds feature a child's vegetable garden and playhouse, a pond and waterfall. Also on the tour, the grounds of The Bayberry nursery, with its Asian inspired boat dock over a manmade half-acre pond. Andrew Sabin's Turtle Bluff, on Amagansett's Bluff Road features goats, chickens, rabbits, pheasants, and a pea hen. You may also meet Wally, the resident pig at large.

Psy issued the apology after reports surfaced in the United States on Friday about his participation in two performances critical of the U.S. military in 2004.
Psy's ""Gangnam Style"" Korean pop and dance video is now the most-watched video ever on YouTube, with more than 900 million views since it was first uploaded in July.
""While I'm grateful for the freedom to express one's self, I've learned there are limits to what language is appropriate and I'm deeply sorry for how these lyrics could be interpreted,"" the rapper said in a statement.
""I will forever be sorry for any pain I have caused by those words,"" he added.
In one performance, which Psy said was from eight years ago, the rapper protested the deaths of two teenage South Korean girls who were run over by a U.S. tank stationed in the country.
In a separate performance, Psy was critical of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and its occupation, in which South Korean forces participated.
Psy is scheduled to perform at the annual ""Christmas in Washington"" television special that will also be attended by Obama and his family, the White House said on Friday. Broadcaster TNT said Psy would still perform as planned. (Reporting by Eric Kelsey; Additional reporting by Mark Felsenthal in Washington; Editing by Jill Serjeant and Peter Cooney)

He applies Systems Theory to his works, layering different steps to create a great, overarching superstructure. This leads the piece to almost create itself on loop, with each work buzzing with an individual, cohesive energy. 

For all the heavy theory behind the work, the pieces themselves are light and almost psychedelic, inviting you in like a cool swimming pool in the summertime. 

His untitled colored pencil drawings buzz and shift before your eyes, a bit too humble to be optical illusions. Koch makes them by sticking colored pencils into a power drills! And then there are the Novelty Vortex (aka Froot Loop) sculptures, modeled after a potential free energy device. Yet these sculptures are arranged into the shape of a flower, a perfect way to show that maybe art and science are not as separate as they seem.

217,CULTURE & ARTS,"Ballet Is an Art, Not a Sport","Brittany Kottler, Contributor
Student at Tulane University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ballet-is-an-art-not-a-sp_us_5bb26ab0e4b0171db6a06f35,"When attending a ballet performance, an audience member will never be able to see the strain on the body because of the ballerina's ability to convey emotion, passion, and artistry.",2014-02-09,ARTS & CULTURE,"Before I begin, I must preface this by mentioning the fact that ballet is competitive. Ballerinas are extremely competitive with each other and the ballet world has a hint of a cutthroat culture. However, ballerinas are competitive with each other in the same way artists, musicians and actors are. Ballet itself is not a competitive sport; it is an art.
For years, the debate of art versus sport has angered ballerinas and has taken away the focus of the true artistry of dance. Yes, it cannot be ignored that ballet is an exceptionally physical performance art. According to a 1975 study done of 61 physical activities conducted by Dr. James A. Nicholas in the Journal of Sports Medicine, ballet ranked number one as the most physically and mentally demanding. The physical aspects of ballet are unnatural: turnout of the hips and dancing on your toes in pointe shoes are huge strains on the body. But, when attending a ballet performance, an audience member will never be able to see the strain on the body because of the ballerina's ability to convey emotion, passion, and artistry. People attend ballets to see grace and beauty, not to see ballerinas struggle with the physical intensity of dance.
In recent years, the performance of dance has changed. The phenomena of dance competitions has pervaded the ballet world. These competitions, such as the renowned Youth America Grand Prix, ruin the art of dance and completely remove the soul and emotion necessary in the art of ballet. This is how ballet and other forms of dance have become closer to a sport than an art. Art is not something that can be judged on a scale of 1-10 because the judgment takes away the passion and creativity. Competitions simply highlight the athleticism of ballet and limit dancers to only performing tricks. The documentary of young dancers, First Position, demonstrates the pressure placed on ballerinas to perfect such tricks in ballet competitions. The focus is never on the dancer's performance as a whole, but rather the perfection of her pirouettes or split leap.
Dance competitions have also spilled over into mainstream television, with shows such as Dancing with the Stars and So You Think You Can Dance. These programs eliminate the artistic side of dance and skew America's perception of the dance world and what dance truly is. On So You Think You Can Dance, aspiring professional dancers perform roughly one-and-a- half-minute routines and are then critiqued by a panel of judges, oftentimes actors or other celebrities who have absolutely no knowledge of dance and technique. Each instance in which a dancer kicks her leg above her head or does a quadruple pirouette, the studio audience erupts in applause and cheers. In actual ballet and dance performances, a dancer is expected to have these skills and enhances them by adding his or her own emotional performance to their perfected technique. For many, So You Think You Can Dance leaves viewers believing dance is a competitive sport. The choreographed routines strive for the ""wow!"" factor while simultaneously removing basic ballet technique and artistic freedom that has been taught to dancers around the world for centuries. 
The true ""wow!"" factor of ballet comes from the entire performance as a whole. There is never a singular step that defines a ballet; it is the entire production that leaves audiences astounded and amazed. The purpose of ballets, especially the classical ones, is to tell the audience a story. Everything from the intricate set designs to the elegant costumes, to even the make-up, is crucial to a ballet's tale and overall impression on the audience. So many artistic elements are combined to make a ballet performance what it is, and the dancers' passion and emotion are the final touch to the show. 
If dancers moved robotically and only performed tricks, ballets would never effectively tell a story and invite audiences into a two-hour world of enchantment and fantasy. Just because ballet is a performance art does not mean we should only pay attention to the steps and physicality, ultimately making it a sport. For it is the emotion and creativity in each dancer that ultimately makes ballet what it is: an art.

We've come a long way from enforced segregation, but as Clybourne Park ruefully notes, we have yet to realize Martin Luther King's dream of a color-blind society.",2012-06-02,ARTS & CULTURE,"Race is a complicated issue in America -- often unfairly reduced to PC dictates from the left or rabid anger from the right. A candid exploration of America's racial history -- and progress -- is ongoing. Obama's election as the first African American president made millions proud, but the discussion -- and the discomfort -- continue.
One of the more provocative forums of engagement is theater. In recent memory, two Broadway plays have confronted the country's racial legacy and current reality: David Mamet's smart and sophisticated Race and Bruce Norris' thoughtful Tony-nominated Clybourne Park, now at the Walter Kerr.
Mamet sets his story in an affluent law firm asked to defend a white man accused of raping a black woman. The issue of guilt or innocence is clouded by race, as is the behavior of staff attorneys. Race, justice and law are fiercely debated by black and white lawyers -- and to Mamet's credit, never predictably or disingenuously. Race nailed prejudice and fear on both sides of the divide. 
Conversely, Clybourne Park posits a typical domestic setting. Act one opens in 1959, a black family is buying a home in a white neighborhood. The white family is asked by neighbors to renege on the deal. They worry that ""one by one,"" residents will flee and property values plummet.
By act two, set in 2009, the neighborhood has been solidly black for decades. Now, a young white couple is buying the same house. It's in a sorry state, but the neighborhood, close to downtown, is slowly gentrifying. It could be any city in the U.S. where neighborhoods are in flux. The twist: the black middle-class neighbors are horrified by the architectural changes the white buyers propose.
The question is whether it's really a disagreement about ""taste,"" or the larger issue of racial integration. As each side tiptoes around the obvious, anger, resentment and exasperation erupt. Rude, offensive jokes are told about blacks and whites. The audience laughs; but the jokes aren't funny. They are verbal assaults fired across the racial bow. As Norris makes clear, everyone is defensive, making real communication impossible.
We've come a long way from enforced segregation, but as Clybourne Park ruefully notes, we have yet to realize Martin Luther King's dream of a color-blind society. To underscore that point, the actors play different roles. For example, Crystal A. Dickinson plays a domestic in 1959; in 2009, she portrays the niece of the black woman who bought the house 50 years ago. Now, she confronts the same discomfort experienced decades earlier by whites. 
In turn, the white woman who sells the house (Christina Kirk) in act one, plays a real-estate lawyer in act two. Her father opposed selling to blacks in the Fifties; now she is defending the right of whites to buy the house anew. The role reversal is a theatrical gimmick that highlights a half-century of social and economic change.
One of the play's strengths, performed by a solid ensemble, is that it skewers the pretensions, stereotypes and feigned niceties of blacks and whites alike. Inspired by Raisin in the Sun, Clybourne Park raises important and divisive issues. But what many may find disquieting, there is no feel-good ending, no pat summation. Just like real life.

Cameron was 48 years old when she obtained her first camera, given to her as a gift by her daughter and son-in-law. ""From the first moment I handled my lens with a tender ardour,"" she wrote upon receiving it, ""and it has become to me as a living thing, with voice and memory and creative vigour."" Cameron was religious, well-read and a bit eccentric, having friends in the Victorian poetry and science circles like Alfred Lord Tennyson and Sir John Herschel. These accomplished compatriots soon became Cameron's favorite subjects. 
 King Lear Alotting His Kingdom to His Three Daughters 
""I began with no knowledge of the art,"" Cameron wrote. ""I did not know where to place my dark box, how to focus my sitter, and my first picture I effaced to my consternation by rubbing my hand over the filmy side of the glass.""
Unfortunately, art critics at the time were not too fond of Cameron's portraits. ""In these pictures all that is good about photography has been neglected, and the shortcomings of the art are prominently exhibited,"" The Photographic Journal printed in 1864. ""We are sorry to have to speak thus severely on the works of a lady, but we feel compelled to do so in the interest of the art."" 
 Sappho
Cameron reveled in the failures of her instruments, preferring to harness the spirit of her subject rather than a direct copy of their image. Her feathery, Pre-Raphaelite photographs float away from reality in their breathy visual interpretations. ""Time does not freeze in such a photograph. It melts and steams,"" Anthony Lane wrote in The New Yorker.
Today we see this love of photography's flaws everywhere, particularly in photography filters like Hipstamatic and Instagram that distort exact digital replications. These contemporary techniques reveal a similar privileging of mood and essence over mimetic imagery.
 A Study 
As Robinson points out, Cameron predates post-modern photo goddess Cindy Sherman in her realization of the theatrics of the medium. In her photographs, Cameron acted out scenes from mythology, the Bible and Shakespeare, even creating an entire series based off Tennyson's poetry. Yet Cameron diverges from Sherman in tone, lacking any sort of irony or critique in her visions.
Somewhere between the styles of F. Holland Day and Francesca Woodman, Cameron's soft-edged, spiritual portraits show that images can look ephemeral while proving immortal.

It was my experience with the great Caitlin Doughty, whom I featured in this space a while back, that turned me on to the fabulosity that exists out there. People like Bess Lovejoy, Brandy Schillace and Gemma Angel each deserve their own feature and will likely get one from me at some point. Today, however, I'd like to introduce you to one in particular who stands out for a number of reasons, including an intriguing new crowd funding appeal for a feature-length documentary project that's just launched via Indiegogo. 

She is Dr. Lindsey Fitzharris. Better known on the Internets as The Chirurgeon's Apprentice.
Fitzharris received a Ph.D. in the History of Science, Medicine & Technology from the University of Oxford in 2009. She is currently a Wellcome Trust Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Queen Mary, University of London. She is the creator and author of the popular website, The Chirurgeon's Apprentice, which looks at the horrors of pre-anesthetic surgery, and has written for New Scientist, The Lancet, History Today and the Guardian. She has appeared on television for the BBC and National Geographic. Here is her deal:
Q: First, What's a Chirurgeon and why just an apprentice? 
Dr. Lindsey Fitzharris: The word ""chirurgeon"" is just an antiquated spelling of ""surgeon"" -- and it is pronounced very similarly. Why an apprentice? I don't like to think of myself as an expert. It implies a finality; an end to learning. And I am very much on a journey of discovering new and wonderful things about this fascinating subject. So in this respect, I really am an apprentice.
Q: Growing up. Were you strange? 
Dr. Lindsey Fitzharris: I'm not going to lie. I was a strange child, and the signs were there from the beginning that I would become an even stranger adult. I used to make my grandmother take me around to old cemeteries in Chicago when I was younger. I suppose you could say I have always been fascinated with death. But more so, I have always been fascinated with the past.
Q: What do you like most about working in this rather morbid space? 
Dr. Lindsey Fitzharris: I've always been a passionate storyteller. I suppose that's what first attracted me to history as a subject. I'm so often moved by the stories I come across in my research -- stories about the people who died, about the loved ones they left behind, and about the surgeons who opened up their dead bodies for the sake of medical science. I like to think I'm bringing the ""human"" back into a history of human anatomy. 
Q: Where did you get the inspiration for The Chirurgeon's Apprentice? 
Dr. Lindsey Fitzharris: The concept for The Chirurgeon's Apprentice evolved from a conversation I had once with my friend, Alex Anstey, founder of Reality in Dreams. He's a filmmaker, and I, a mere historian. Yet, he was fascinated with my research. That got me thinking: maybe my work has broader appeal. Driven partly by this and partly by the desire to reach beyond walls of academia, I started the website. Incidentally, Alex -- who was recently First Assistant Editor on the Les Misérables film -- will also be editing Medicine's Dark Secrets. I'm very lucky to have such a talented and creative team behind this project. 
Q: Speaking of which, you're planning a feature-length documentary and you've launched a crowd funding appeal on Indiegogo just a few days ago. How's it going so far?
Dr. Lindsey Fitzharris: Unbelievably well! I am constantly amazed by the generosity of those interested in this dark and macabre subject! Within 48 hours, we had already raised over $6,500. I just hope we reach our goal so that I can make this project a reality.
Q: Why do you want to make Medicine's Dark Secrets?
Dr. Lindsey Fitzharris: For me, history should not be experienced through words alone. It should be seen, felt, heard. I believe interacting with historical objects is just as important as reading about them. Not everyone has access to collections like the ones I do, which is why I want to make the film. I don't believe the past belongs only to historians and scholars. I want viewers to experience medical history in a more dynamic way than they might otherwise be able to do from reading about it in a book. 
Q: You write about a lot of gory history. Is there anything you can't stomach?
Dr. Lindsey Fitzharris: If I'm writing about it, I'm not fussed. If I'm experiencing it, that's another matter! I'm attending an autopsy next month and am terrified by the thought of it. The sight, the smell, the feel of a dead body! I have no idea how I will react when I am face-to-face with the realities of death. 
It reminds me that there is much more to the human experience than I could ever convey with words. 
Q: Is death ""the last taboo?"" 
Dr. Lindsey Fitzharris: I'm not sure I'd say it's the last taboo, but it certainly can be taboo in today's society. We interact with death in very different ways than people did in the past. Some of the objects I'll be looking at in Medicine's Dark Secrets may shock viewers, like the book made of human skin or the dissected hands of a man who committed suicide in the 19th century. 
What I hope to provide through this documentary is historical context. Most importantly, I want viewers to remember that these disembodied specimens once belonged to real people with lives like you and me. 
Q: You must be a good time at a dinner party.
Dr. Lindsey Fitzharris: I have to be careful when I'm in the company of strangers. I have a knack for blurting out gruesome facts that sometimes leave people looking a bit pale! But the story I always tell -- and one which seems to delight most -- is the one about the barber's pole. It was the first story I ever wrote about on The Chirurgeon's Apprentice. Most people are unaware that barber-surgeons (as they were often called) bled patients for medicinal purposes in earlier centuries. The tradition of the striped barber's pole harks back to that era, when it served as an advertisement for their proficiency as bloodletters. The pole represents the rod that the patient gripped to make their veins bulge and the brass ball at the top symbolizes the basin used to collect the blood. The red and white stripes represent the bloodied bandages. Once washed and hung to dry on the rod outside the shop, they would twist in the wind, forming the familiar spiral pattern adorning the barber poles of today.

221,CULTURE & ARTS,Michael Knight's 'Wayward' Opens At Luis De Jesus Gallery (PHOTOS),Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-knights-wayward-o_us_5bb22939e4b0171db69df327,"Brushtop, Michael Knight ""Wayward"" will show at Luis De Jesus Gallery in Los Angeles from June 2 to July 14. The tiny paintings",2012-06-02,ARTS & CULTURE,"Michael Knight's new exhibition is entitled ""Wayward,"" as in whimsical, fickle, perverse or even incorrigible. These waves of tickling curiosity to full-on frustration mimic the experience of viewing Knight's works, which seem to hide nothing yet elude us all the same. 
The tiny paintings, intimate yet strange, hint at modernist abstraction but remain between styles and statements. They are undeniably beautiful but somewhat of a tease. With fat, generous strokes Knight creates architectural atmospheres that adhere to neither flatness nor depth. If we had to liken them to something outside their own world, we might think of weather or the internet ether. Although weather and ether do not seem to have much in common at first, both are real although not graspable, able to be experienced but not captured.
 Brushtop, Michael Knight
Works like ""Beach House"" fall more on the weather side, looking almost like a window facing out onto the ocean. Meanwhile ""Brushtop"" is far more removed from representation. The colors create their their own grammar; most rhyme in muddled sea foam hues but the red-and-blue stripe rudely interrupts. The saturated, self-contained world resembles the web's ability to encompass so much while remaining removed. 
Knight, who was born in Portland and now lives in Los Angeles, cites Howard Hodgkin and Richard Diebenkorn among his influences. Hodgkin has a remarkable ability to conjure feelings, historical moments, even smells with his paint strokes. They lead to concrete destinations instead of confusion. Yet Knight seems aware of the wayward nature of his strokes, and lets them be. The paintings leave a lasting impression, even if the impression is frustration. 
""Wayward"" will show at Luis De Jesus Gallery in Los Angeles from June 2 to July 14.

222,CULTURE & ARTS,The 12 Most Talented And Tiny Child Prodigies Of 2013,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/child-prodigies-2013_us_5bb268dfe4b0171db6a047cc,"6. Umi Garrett, 13 years old NC Child Prodigy Suffers from Debilitating Disease Nigerian photographer Onafujiri ""Fuji"" Remet",2013-12-22,ARTS & CULTURE,"As this tumultuous year comes to a close, we'd like to take a moment to look back on 2013's most precocious child prodigies. From breakdancers to pianists to pint-sized photographers, these are the young spirits who awed us with their talent, slayed us with their cuteness and made us feel painfully inadequate with their accomplishments. 
May we humbly present the 12 tiniest, and most talented, child prodigies who made a splash in the art world this year. Prepare yourself for lots of squeals, ""awww""s and spurts of low self-esteem.
1. Avery Molek, 6 years old
Meet Avery Molek, a six-year-old drummer who experienced his 15 minutes of YouTube fame in 2013. In a video that made the rounds last March, the tiny drummer can be seen shredding his way through Van Halen's ""Hot For Teacher,"" barely missing a beat as he plays the classic song like a pro. Read more about Molek here.
2. Malik Kofi, 11 years old
At a height of just over five feet, an instrument like the cello nearly eclipses the body of 11-year-old child prodigy Malik Kofi. But that didn't stop the young musician from impressing the best of his adult contemporaries with his unbelievable classical music skills. “He’s an extremely talented cellist,"" said Udi Bar-David, player for the Philadelphia Orchestra, ""very creative, mature, has stage presence, is open to learning and has strong ideas of his own."" Read more about Kofi here.
3. Hwang Min-woo, 7 years old
Although the seven-year-old boy's given name is Hwang Min-woo, you may know him as ""Little PSY."" The young dancing machine went viral this year after performing an impressive rendition of PSY's iconic pony dance alongside him in ""Gangnam Style."" He also released an electro, K-pop song on iTunes this year and is painfully adorable, especially when donning a suit and sunglasses. Read more about ""Little PSY"" here.
4. B-girl Terra, 6 years old
A six-year-old breakdancing prodigy named ""B-girl Terra"" put all adult dancers to shame in a YouTube video that circulated earlier this year. The miniature competitor took part in the Chelles Battle Pro competition in Paris, blowing away the rest of the contestants with her unbelievable windmills and headspins. Read more about the B-girl here.
5. Tyler Clemons, 4 years old
Like most four-year-olds, little Tyler Clemons enjoys banging on objects around the home. So what separates him from the rest of his destruction-prone peers? The answer: a pair of drum sticks and the label ""child prodigy."" In a video posted by Louisiana news outlet KPLC, Clemons grinned widely as his mother described him as a prodigious drummer. ""He just wouldn't stop banging on things. All day, everyday,"" she says. Prodigy? We're not so sure, but we can't help but want to pinch his cheeks. Read more about Tyler here.
5. Autumn de Forest, 11 years old
  Autumn de Forest, ""Jasper Map""
Child prodigy extraordinaire Autumn de Forest rose to fame a few years ago when, at the tender age of seven, the Discovery Channel labeled her a ""child genius."" Media outlets at the time were enamored with her painting abilities, praising the child for her tendency to create canvases that, well, looked like the work of established artists -- and the praise continued in 2013. An adult artist might get slapped with the ugly term ""derivative,"" but how can one do that to a child? It's not fair. We're reminded of Joan Acocella's 1994 New Yorker piece, ""Discussing the Undiscussable,” where she writes of an artist being ""beyond the reach of criticism."" And yet, how can we approach the work if not critically? Read more about Autumn here.
6. Umi Garrett, 13 years old
If you know the name Umi Garrett, it's probably due to a certain performance of hers on the Ellen Degeneres show, which undoubtedly will go down in history as one of the cutest musical performances to ever be televised. Umi, who was only eight years old at the time, won our hearts with her gifted piano skills and enviable cotton candy frock. She also has a pretty adorable Twitter account. In 2013, five years after her big break, we checked in with Umi, who was preparing herself for teenage life. Update: she continues to tour and play piano and, in her spare time, rocks out to One Direction. Read an interview with Umi here.
7. Fuji, 3 years old

Nigerian photographer Onafujiri ""Fuji"" Remet made a name for himself earlier this summer when his work was showcased in a Lagos exhibition. Aside from his curious eye and ability to capture the color and motion of Nigerian street life, Remet received attention for his miniature stature -- he is three years old after all. Yes, you read that right. Little Fuji learned to man a Sony SLR before most of us could spell our names. His photos capture everything from street vendors to family portraits, from an unusually pint-sized vantage point. Fuji's early initiation to the art world can be attributed to his creative family. His father and two older sisters are artists as well. At present, the ambitious young photographer has 3,000 images to his name, according to Visual News. Not bad for a toddler. Read more about Fuji here.
8. Caesar Sant, 4 years old
NC Child Prodigy Suffers from Debilitating Disease
Caesar Sant is a four-year-old child prodigy with a gift for playing the violin. He started learning the instrument just over a year ago and, as you can see in the video that circulated this past year, is already impressing instructors with his adorable renditions of ""The Star Spangled Banner."" However, beyond his talent for the violin and knack for reading complicated sheet music, the young genius suffers from a rare form of sickle cell anemia that's caused Caesar to have two strokes in a period of six months, one of which resulted in the temporary loss of mobility in his bowing arm. According to the Winston Salem Journal, his family, including neuroscientist father Lucas Santos, have turned to a stem cell bone marrow transplant -- a $500,000 procedure offered through Johns Hopkins University -- as the ""only cure"" for the young boy. Read more about Cesar here.
9. Rhema Marvanne, 11 years old
Rhema Marvanne's solo rendition of ""O Holy Night"" is heartbreakingly moving, and she was just seven years old when she recorded it. The tiny songstress has a heavenly voice, and she takes inspiration from someone that she believes is up above as well-- her mother Wendi, who died from ovarian cancer in 2008, just one year before this song was recorded. Marvanne told the Fort Hood Sentinel, “When I sing, it makes me think of my mother, which makes me happy. I want to take my gift that makes me happy and share with those who are still sad and try to make them happy again.” Read more about Rhema, who we covered in 2013, here. 
10. Ryan Wang, 5 years old
Ryan Wang, the adorable five-year-old piano prodigy who captured Ellen Degeneres' heart earlier this year, has another unexpected admirer. Her name is Dorothy Landry, and she's 101 years old. Thanks to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Landry was recently able to enjoy her very own private recital captured in the video above. Although she'd seen Wang perform before, she's hard of hearing, so this up-close experience was invaluable. Read more about Ryan here.
11. Amira Willighagen, 9 years old
When nine-year-old Amira Willighagen from Nijmegen in the Netherlands stepped onto the ""Holland's Got Talent"" stage, no one was expecting such a big voice to come out of such a very little girl. Her incredible rendition of Puccini's ""O Mio Babbino Caro"" from the opera ""Gianni Schicchi"" earned her a Golden Ticket from the judges that would take her straight to the live show. It's hard to believe how young Amira is, but even more surprising to learn that she is completely self-taught, and used only YouTube tutorials to learn how to sing. Read more about Amira here.
12. Malachi Samedy, 9 years old
Nine-year-old Malachi Samedy has been drumming since before he could walk. He got his first drum set at 24 months, was admitted to music school at age four, and by the time he was seven, was close to realizing his dream of performing for President Obama. ""When he was younger, he would just bang on everything,"" Malachi's father, Nasser Samedy, says in this HooplaHa video, ""My wife was saying, 'You know, he's a drummer.'"" Malachi has been wowing older professional musicians with his talent ever since. What's more, he's using his talent to bring attention to causes that matter, commonly visiting children's locations to share his music and positive message. Read more about Malachi here.

224,CULTURE & ARTS,Papermoon Puppet Theater Portrays Indonesia's Darker History (INTERVIEW),Katherine Brooks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/papermoon-puppet-theater_us_5bb23381e4b0171db69e4bdb,"Papermoon's performances reveal intimate moments of Indonesia's past, but the company maintains that a discussion of politically",2012-09-09,ARTS & CULTURE,"Indonesia's Papermoon Puppet Theater is taking an art form we often associate with children's stories and turning it into a vehicle for addressing the country's dark history. The company, started by visual artists Maria Tri Sulistyani and her husband Iwan Effendi, uses whimsical puppets and multimedia performances to recreate personal accounts of the mass jailings and executions that took place in Indonesia in 1965. They are harrowing stories, meant to shed light on the emotion and complexity of a time period often glossed over in contemporary history. 
Papermoon's performances reveal intimate moments of Indonesia's past, but the company maintains that a discussion of politically driven atrocities is something accessible to international audiences. And the U.S. State Department agreed, recruiting Papermoon for its Center Stage program that will be touring throughout the country this year. Sulistyani and Effendi will be showcasing their work, “Mwathirika,"" alongside ensembles from Haiti and Pakistan, sharing their brand of art as an initiative of cultural diplomacy. 
We asked Maria Tri Sulistyani about her beginnings in the world of puppetry, the heavy themes she's chosen to present and how she thinks art can interact with diplomacy in an email interview: 

Can you tell us a little about traditional shadow puppetry in Indonesia? How does your style of puppetry compare?
Wayang kulit (Shadow Puppetry) has been an important art form – especially on Bali and Java – for almost 1,000 years. Its stories of good and evil, of love and death and transformation are most often taken from the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. A single dhalang (master puppeteer) manipulates all of the many two dimensional leather puppets from behind a screen (to cast shadows). He also voices all of the characters. It is a virtuoso performance! While reaching back in history to tell his tales, the master puppeteer always makes reference to current happenings. Traditional puppet theater has played an important role in communicating values to communities. 
There is also another kind of puppetry – Teater Boneka – that is generally just for children and it is a much less formal. Inspiration for the stories and the puppets come from lots of different influences – even Sesame Street.
The interesting part is that people in Indonesia had never connected these two types of puppetry before. Papermoon makes that link, and this is something new. Our pieces are performed on stages, like a theater play. Several puppeteers are on stage manipulating the puppets. Mwathirika, the piece we are presenting on tour, is really for adults, not kids and is a story told without words, without speaking. But we are telling stories about values, too -- about moral choices and conflicts and relating to everyday life. Our stories are really personal and focus on individuals. From there we can see the bigger issues. Though Papermoon is not really creating a performance in the traditional form, we too want to share and talk about the values and ideals and choices of Indonesian people's life.
Your earlier work, ""Noda Lelaki di Dada Mona (A Stain on Mona's Chest),"" used puppets to convey a politically and sexually charged story. What was the reaction in Indonesia to such a performance?
It was very interesting because Papermoon had created performances for children since 2006, and ""Noda Lelaki di Dada Mona"" was the very first time we created a piece for an adult audience. That was also the first time we sold tickets to a performance, 300 seats, and it sold out!
People were shocked with what they saw. Not just only about the theme, but also by the kind of puppets we performed with, how realistic they were, and how we combined puppets with the actors who spoke as individuals, which had never been seen by people in Yogyakarta. Together with our audience, we started to realize that puppet theater could reach many people, including adults. Instead of having one puppeter verbalize all the voices, we decided each puppeter will speak for his own puppet. I would say that ""Noda Lelaki di Dada Mona"" was a kick start for Papermoon to do more performances, based on social themes, to communicate with many different types of audience.
In ""Mwathirika"" you have again focused on more serious accounts, this time of imprisonment and violence. Do you think the use of puppets makes it easier to express these heavy themes? Or easier to digest on the part of the audience?
Yes. For us, puppets are the perfect medium to bring an unexpected moments or difficult subjects to the audience. Puppets always have the image of cuteness, happiness, sometimes scary, but mostly FUN. So when people come to the theater, with a certain expectation of puppetry, they can be surprised, because what they see is totally different from what they thought. 
Many people feel like the story of 1965 is already over, it's expired, helpless, over-researched, or it's never been heard. By seeing a poster of two little boys with a red balloon, people will think about something sweet. They don't have fear to come, they feel relaxed, they are open. It’s perfect. 

You spoke to a number of people - parents, grandparents, neighbors - who provided their stories for ""Mwathirika."" Could you tell us about one story in particular that sheds light on the historical situation in Indonesia?
We asked them about what they felt at those moments in their lives. There was a lot of data, books about the 1965 tragedy, but very few could give insight into their feelings. And by interviewing those people, we could see their eyes, and what they really felt in their hearts – uncover their personal stories. 
One of our company member's uncle, told a story about how he, a 12 year old boy, had to take care of his little brothers and sisters, after their father was taken away by government officials, and didn't come back for 13 years. He had to catch frogs in the rice fields, for his family to eat. And how the family grew in the middle of these chaotic moments, with children with no parents, and no one in the village dared to help, because if they helped they might be caught by the army too. In Mwathirika, we are not pointing fingers; we are not saying that one person is right and one person is wrong. But we tell a story about the impact of political turmoil on those who lived through those terrible times and the huge effect it has had on the next generation.
Your project has now become a tool for cultural diplomacy, helping to foster greater understanding in the US in particular. How do you view art in the greater scheme of international cooperation? Do you think that art has the potential to bring people together in a way that other diplomatic tools can not?
Yes. What people know about other countries or cultures, is mostly from the media. And it's usually about all problems of economy, technology, war, conflict, and how to deal with that on a big scale. Of course people need to do big things, but sometimes people forgot how important it is to build a personal solution for the problems. And for us, Art is a personal thing. It’s about how we can reach out one person to another. When people meet, exchange their cultures, see another art from those who live in another country, then they see a different thing, they learn to respect each other. If people can share, talk more about their culture, the respect will go deeper, and hopefully an understanding of each other will be built there. Like we said, Art gets personal. This is where those big actions made by government might not reach.
Last question: Indonesia has become one of the region's largest markets for contemporary art. How has the art scene changed in Indonesia since the 1960s?
When Indonesia became an independent country in 1945, art was seen as a big strength and unifying force for the country. The government put a lot of attention on the development of the arts. Sometimes, art was also used as a political tool.
In 1965, the art scene was changed by the political turmoil, lots of critical artists were jailed, silenced, disappeared in the violent political battles between the government and the Army. There were three years of chaos. When General Suharto took power in 1968, the government centralized the arts. Artists that had not been caught, and were still active, could develop their careers, but always had to support – promote --the government. And though things loosened up little by little over time, that was really the case up until the 1990s. The government was still very oppressive, and they didn't want people to say bad things about them.
In 1998 when there were riots in the streets all over the country because of the falling economy, Suharto resigned and things began to change again – to open up and become less centralized. Since then, the art scene is changing (very quickly) again, because of the openness of information through internet, etc.
Papermoon will begin their US tour on September 8th, 2012 at The Kennedy Center Millenium Stage. For more dates, check out their schedule here.

The contemporary sculptor, fondly referred to as ""Spiderwoman"", would turn 101 years old if she were magically alive today.
 IMAGE: In this 1990 file photo released by the Guggenheim Museum shows Louis Bourgeois alongside her sculpture ""Eye to Eye, 1970."" (AP Photo/Guggenheim Museum, Raimon Ramis, File)
Bourgeois, born in Paris in 1911, began studying art in her twenties while enrolled at the renowned French academic institution -- the Sorbonne. She favored painting as her medium of choice, until a fated encounter with French painter Fernand Leger, who explained to the budding artist that she was in fact a sculptor. 
Following graduation, she continued her collegiate career at the Ecole de Beaux-Arts and Ecole du Louvre, later opening her own print store. It was at this store that she met her husband, the famous American art historian, Robert Goldwater. The power duo moved to New York City soon after marrying, where Goldwater took on a teaching position at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts and Bourgeois studied at the city's Art Students League. Living in Manhattan in the 1940s and '50s, Bourgeois's work transitioned from upright wood sculptures to marble, plaster and bronze, using the refined materials to explore concepts of memory and fear. During this period, she came into contact with creatives like Willem De Kooning, Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock, painters who received far much more attention for their abstract and expressionist art than the female artist at the time.
Later in her career, Bourgeois dabbled in teaching, working at institutes like Pratt, Cooper Union, Brooklyn College and the New York Studio School. She began expressing an interest in activism, joining the Fight Censorship Group, a feminist-minded organization founded by Antia Steckel, as well as a number of LGBT organizations and AIDS awareness campaigns. Her art continued to go unrecognized for years though, and it wasn't until 1982 that Bourgeois experienced her first retrospective, a survey of largely autobiographical sculptures hosted by the Museum of Modern Art. In the 2000s, she directed most of her art making toward LGBT rights, creating a piece entitled ""I Do"" in 2010 that was dedicated to marriage equality. Her social sentiments could be summed up in the following quote: ""Everyone should have the right to marry. To make a commitment to love someone forever is a beautiful thing.""
Following Bourgeois's death in 2010, her art has become highly sought after, with one of her ""Spider"" works selling for $10.7 million at auction, the highest bid achieved by any female artist. To celebrate the acclaimed sculptor, we've put together a slideshow of her works, including the famous arachnid-inspired installation.

Immerses Little Kids In High Art (PHOTOS),Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hi-art-art-education_us_5bb22740e4b0171db69de048,"Bellen-Berthézène sat the kids down to continue watching Rimsky's ""Sadko,"" an opera they would watch and interact with over",2012-05-12,ARTS & CULTURE,"Most educational programs, even those with solid art programs, portray art as a reprieve from homework and arithmetic. Frivolous and fun, art is a way to decorate the realities of learning, growing up and living. But not this program. ""Hi Art!"" exposes kids to opera and other forms of high art starting at toddlerdom. A bold mission, it's true, but a hugely successful one thus far. In its 15 years of running the program has become one of the most talked-about in New York. 
Cyndie Bellen-Berthézène, ""Hi Art!""s founder and director, said, ""Great art transmits something that is essentially human."" It doesn't just color our lives, it has the power to be at the core of how we live. Although when I think of opera we tend to think of a stodgy, elderly woman with teeny binoculars and white gloves, at its core opera is pure human expression. The words, the costumes, the sets, all take the back seat to an indescribable momentum and feeling. What is more accessible than that?

It's a nice idea, but would it work? Visions of tiny children with baby binoculars flashed through my mind. I entered the airy space, combining the best aspects of an artist's loft and a preschool classroom, mixing Pollock-ish mammoth canvasses with, well, large amounts of glitter. Bellen-Berthézène told me about the roots of the project; she was an opera singer, her husband a composer, and the duo would regularly play opera for their daughter. Bellen-Berthézène soon realized her toddler daughter had internalized the music in ""Petrushka,"" predicting the next scene while she couldn't even see the TV. Bellen-Berthézène used her daughter, who was an unusually apt communicator for her age, to express the connection that, presumably, other children were feeling to high art but just could not communicate. ""We assume everything has to be made very small for kids,"" Bellen-Berthézène said. ""When in fact kids learn a tremendously large amount, they just don't have the language for it.""
My visit to ""Hi Art!"" came just days after the launch of the “Impact Creativity” campaign, which supports theater education programs in low-income schools around the country. The program is ""in response to the alarming decline in funding for arts education and seeks to... help shape a more intelligent, diverse, confident and creative 21st century workforce by investing in arts and theater education as essential learning."" This shift from excess to essence is a huge one, one that both ""Impact Creativity"" and ""HiArt!'s"" non-profit offshoot, ""The Time In Children's Arts Initiative,"" bravely enact. 

In came the kids. Bellen-Berthézène had given be a little background on this particular class. Pulled from one of the Bronx's struggling districts, this kindergarten class was composed of children with special needs and learning disabilities as well as some without. All were from low income families, many from troubled homes. Hi Art! was a sort of permanent field trip, bringing the kids by bus to Chelsea for around two hours once a week. 
They immediately flocked to Bellen-Berthézène and I, who were seated on two red, velvet pillows. ""Miss Cindy!"" they screamed as they gave her hugs and squeezed her hand. The eyed our cups of coffee, spurring choruses of ""What are you drinking?"" And then, seeing our crossed legs, ""Are you doing yoga?"" Immediately a cloud formed around us of pint-sized yogis chanting ""om."" 
Bellen-Berthézène sat the kids down to continue watching Rimsky's ""Sadko,"" an opera they would watch and interact with over a two month period. But first, dance time. The kids were glowing as they bounced and twirled to the number, scarves in hand, but they were more than just excited to jump around. They were clearly feeling the music, hovering to the ground in the lull before the crescendo, and then leaping up at the throbbing climax. They didn't have the vocabulary to discuss the progression of the opera, but they were definitely aware of it. 

Then we watched a performance. For a moment the kids air-conducted but soon they were transfixed on the screen. Bellen-Berthézène translated the Russian lyrics into an English fairy tale. Then the children interacted with the opera, making a collage based off the day's clip. Although I couldn't stay, the class would later climb through the interactive installation at Tanya Bonakdur Gallery. 
The trip was a great example of how opera could change from being a passive pastime of the culturally literate to a vessel for universal human expression. In other words, through programs like these, the opera changes from elitist to equalizing. When those kids were dancing to opera, they got it. As Bellen-Berthézène said, ""Mozart speaks to five year olds from the Bronx as much as it speaks to 60 year olds at the Met."" 
Correction: A previous edition of this article stated the class viewed was part of the HiArt program. In fact it was part of HiArt!'s non-profit offshoot, The Time In Children's Arts Initiative.

This week we laughed (and maybe cried a little) over a botched restoration, drooled over unbelievably detailed drawings and watched way too many Labyrinth YouTube videos in anticipation of Bowie's next big move. Scroll down for all the juicy details. 

We've always imagined the work of an art restoration to be a painstaking process involving highly-trained individuals crammed in the basement of a museum, slaving over old texts and using many, many tiny paint brushes. We certainly did not picture an elderly volunteer sneaking around in a church, haphazardly painting over a classical image of Jesus until he resembled less the son of God and more a furry, sci-fi creature. 
The DIY project took place a couple of weeks ago at the the church of Santuario de Misericordia in Borja, Spain, when an elderly woman reportedly took it upon herself to repair a fresco by 19th century Spanish artist Elias Garcia Martinez. Replacing nearly all of Martinez's original brushstrokes, the woman's reimagination of Christ went horribly awry when she turned the detailed figure into what appears to be a featureless monster.As one HuffPost commenter put it, ""It's Ewok Jesus!"" 
The bizarre gaffe has gone viral and now Beast Jesus devotees are looking to halt a restoration of the restoration. Oh, the internet. 

Look closely... it may be hard to hard to believe but the image above is actually a drawing made by Portugal-based attorney, Samuel Silva. Silva, who describes his art as a “hobby,"" uses standard ballpoint pens for many of his drawings, sometimes working on a piece for over 45 hours. 
For his “Redhead Girl,” based on the photograph by Russian photographer Kristina Taraina, he used seven different colored ballpoint pens which took some 30 hours to finish. To create such vibrant colors, Silva “cross hatches” in layers to give off the illusion of additional hues and depth. Click here to see more. 

A group of women were slated to snooze in the central gallery of the National Art Museum of Ukraine this month, inviting worthy male suitors to try and wake the slumbering women with a single kiss. They're not under the spell of an evil witch or a poison apple however; instead, the ladies been recruited to participate in an art exhibit appropriately titled ""Sleeping Beauty.""
The fairy-tale inspired project was imagined by Ukrainian-Canadian artist Taras Polataiko. Influenced by an old story by Charles Perrault, where a young maiden is cursed to sleep for 100 years, only to be awakened by true love's kiss. In the spirit of this ""once upon a time"" literature, Polataiko cast several female volunteers as his performance beauties, tasked with ""sleeping"" in the Ukrainian museum for two hours at a time, every day from August 22nd until September 9th. Dressed in white and laid upon an elevated bed, the women lay motionless in the museum's space, awaiting a kiss from that one perfect museum patron.
But there's a serious legal catch to the piece. To participate in the exhibit, potential princes have to sign a contract that states, ""If I kiss the Beauty and she opens her eyes, I agree to marry her."" The female performers have also entered into an agreement that reads, ""If I open my eyes while being kissed, I agree to marry the kisser."" So unlike the chivalrous charmers of yore, these contemporary heroes are contractually bound to live happily ever after if their princess so chooses.

A Norwegian art gallery learned the hard way that the extra fee for postal insurance is worth the inconvenience when it lost a Rembrandt etching worth $8,600 this week.
According to the BBC, the Soli Brug Gallery originally bought a copy of one of the Dutch painter's etchings, titled ""Lieven Willemsz, van Coppenol, Wiriting-Master,"" from a British dealer. After receiving notice that the purchase was available for pick-up at the post office, the gallery went to retrieve the package only to find that it had never actually arrived.
Reports of the incident place no blame on the artwork's dealer (who's name was not disclosed for confidentiality concerns); instead, the onus of responsibility is placed on the Norwegian gallery that used economy mail service to ship a 17th century work of art.

David Bowie diehards know there's more to the singer's filmography than ""Labyrinth."" But Bowie's side career -- which includes a starring turn in ""Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence,"" and a Saturn-winning performance in ""The Man Who Fell To Earth"" -- hasn't exactly been canonized.
That changes this month when ""Bowiefest"" takes over London's Institute of Contemporary Arts. From Friday, Aug. 31 to Sunday, Sept. 2, the event billed as ""the UK's first Bowie film festival"" will celebrate the singer's 65th year with a slew of films, documentaries, DJs, and a moderated discussion with Woody Woodmansey, the drummer from Bowie's first band, The Spiders From Mars. (We may as well call this the summer of Bowie, coming on the heels of the news that he's helping curate his own exhibit at the Victoria and Albert Museum.)

That is what we love and hate about Kelley, who took his own life last year after dealing with life-long depression.

Her canvases tackle global turmoil in 2011, including the rise of Occupy Wall Street, Anonymous hackers, the health insurance crisis, the Tunisian Revolution, protests in Greece, and the Spanish M15 movement.
While ""Shell Game"" bursts with depictions of corruption and violence, for Crabapple, the past few years have been a mix of birth amid destruction. ""Yes, it was awful, but it was also magic, she told Wired in an interview. ""It was the magic of people speaking to each other, waking up, helping each other. For every person beaten up, everyone arrested, it was also a year of fierce aliveness.""

Like Hannah Hoch's politically-charged Dadaist collages or Frida Kahlo's symbolic works, in Crabapple's paintings a political message emerges from the visual chaos.
As Occupy Wall Street unfolded right outside her window, Crabapple sketched posters for the movement in real time. ""Shell Game"" began as a Kickstarter project. It's worth noting that her paintings about the power of a united crowd would not have been possible without crowdsourcing. 
""Shell Game"" will be on view April 14 - 23 at Smart Clothes Gallery in New York.

Although it was Robbins who, in the search of like-minded creators, first reached out to Paulson, it was Paulson that suggested that they meet. 
But they wouldn't meet just anywhere, Paulson explained. They would meet in the exact midpoint between their two locations, the middle of a pond located in the southern Czech Republic, and not communicate again until they saw each other there at high noon at an agreed upon date.
It was an art project to be sure, but maybe not the kind that your high school art teacher assigned you in 2D workshop. Nevertheless, it's the subject of the inaugural episode of ""The Art Assignment,"" an adamantly interactive web series by former Indianapolis Museum Of Art curator Sarah Urist Green. The series' goal, to ""demystify the art-making process and bring you to a wider understanding of what art is and what it could be,"" is evident throughout the episode, embedded above.
""Hold on, I understand why this is, like, beautiful and metaphorically resonant, but this is not The Metaphorically Resonant Assignment. It's The Art Assignment,"" Sarah's co-host and husband John Green protests after Paulson and Robbins' border-crossing and definition-bending artwork is introduced. ""Why is that art?""   ""People have been arguing for a long time that art doesn't have to be an object or material. It can be something like Roy Ascott said: triggers for experiences... The definition [for art] has broadened."" Sarah explains.
It certainly has. Sarah traveled across the country to interview Paulson and Robbins in New York for the web series, and is excited to visit more creative spaces. ""I think for lesser known art hubs, Kansas City has a good cool art scene, Minneapolis has a great art scene, and there are places, of course, all over the country,"" she told HuffPost Arts, ""and I'm really looking forward to continuing to discover new places.""
Each stop will include an artist and an ""assignment"", one that viewers will be encouraged to attempt themselves. The assignments will be diverse: some in the future might delve into more traditional forms, but at least one will include the making of a GIF. 
But are GIFs really art? Will they one day find their place in museums? This question made the former curator laugh. ""I'm sure that an animated GIF has been shown in a museum already, but I think that the younger generation, as they grow up, maybe the distinctions between these mediums, like a video and a GIF and a photo, I think those will be less distinct and people will be more comfortable.""
John, at least, has been convinced. He's already scheduled his ""meet in the middle"" masterpiece for this week, when he'll trudge through the snow and slush of Indianapolis to see a familiar face in a wholly unfamiliar backyard.
The art world might be changing, and only for the more exciting.

Video courtesy of John Yoyogi Fortes.
To experience the work in ""Made for You and Me: New Work by Martin Webb"", opening June 15 at The Compound Gallery in Oakland, is to come across sophisticated folk art, conceptually vigorous, visually intriguing folk art, in some out of the way place you stop on the way to somewhere else. 
The exhibition consists of paintings and a sculptural installation. If the paintings concern themselves with landscapes, then the installation's concerns are more cosmological.
Mr. Webb wrote out the lyrics of Woody Guthrie's iconic folk song, ""This Land Is Your Land"" on the surface of the paintings. Subsequent layers of paint obstructed most of the words, so they appear subsequently as either design elements or else as a reminder of the passage of time. Of significance, Mr. Webb, originally from Britain, was going through the naturalization process to live in the U.S. The work, then, addresses personal issues of identity and assimilation and more general dynamics of permanence versus impermanence, nature versus human progress, and transformation versus stability.
Made from mixed media, cement, and acrylic on panel, the paintings resemble pictographs, simple maps of landscapes with featureless figures and schematized trees that appear to be seen first from a speeding car or train and then transcribed from memory. Trees and figures appear to be hastily drawn, as if to catch, for future reference, an approximate sense of place and location. 
Consisting of 16 recycled freeway guardrail posts, each 64x8x8 inches, placed 8 to 10 inches apart in a loosely circular cluster about six feet in diameter, the painted sculpture installation ""Grove"" resembles a cluster of totem poles arranged in some once-significant but now forgotten pattern. They are made from paint and gold leaf, and finished with wax. Incised just below the surface of the wood, the painted glyphs reference the geometric abstraction of, say, Mondrian and, set against the crude timber, create a visual and conceptual tension between the organic and the man-made. 
The exhibition runs from June 15 - July 21. Gallery hours are 12 - 6pm, Thursday - Sunday. The gallery is located at The Compound Gallery, 1167 65th Street, Oakland, CA 94608. For more information call (510) 601-1702 or visit www.thecompoundgallery.com.

238,CULTURE & ARTS,Telling Harrowing Tales About Child Abuse,"George Heymont, Contributor
San Francisco-based arts critic",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/telling-painful-tales-abo_us_5bb22e39e4b0171db69e1b83,Black N Blue Boys/Broken Men is a deeply disturbing and powerful one-woman show written and performed by Dael Orlandersmith.,2012-07-22,ARTS & CULTURE,"A pattern common to families that suffer domestic abuse is that the abused child grows up to become an adult who reenacts the abuse he received in his youth. Sometimes it's only a matter of time before self-destructive behaviors which have lain dormant (or which the abused child hopes to have conquered) resurface to destroy years of hard work aimed at overcoming one's past.  The Berkeley Repertory Theatre recently presented Black N Blue Boys/Broken Men as part of a world premiere co-production with the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. A deeply disturbing one-woman show written and performed by Dael Orlandersmith, this powerful monologue delivers 90 minutes of gut-wrenching tales about young boys who, after being abused by their fathers, mothers, uncles, and friends of the family, grew into adults sitting on a powder keg of repressed anger.
  Dael Orlandersmith is the writer and solo performer of Black N Blue Boys/Broken Men
Among the battered souls brought to life by Orlandersmith are:
Flaco, a young man whose mother's roving fingers would not leave him alone. No one believes Flaco when he complains about his mother's insistence on reaching into his pants and fondling his dick, so he finally gives up and starts having sex with her. After his father walks into the room one afternoon and finds Flaco fucking his mother, the boy is thrown out of the apartment and, at the age of 12, learns from a friend how to hustle tricks under the Coney Island boardwalk. A pimp gives Flaco $30 each time he satisfies a customer but, upon learning that the pimp is charging his customers $300, Flaco gets mad, leaves the shelter of the pimp's home, and starts turning tricks in the West Village. Often, his clients are wealthy businessmen who want a threeway with their wives or girlfriends. One night, Flaco is picked up by a man in a limousine who fucks the 14-year-old boy until he bleeds, then throws $400 in his face and orders him to get the hell out of the car. That $400 is the most money Flaco has ever made in one day, but it makes him feel awful. He can't wait for a chance to wash himself off. Tenny, the uncle everyone loves and trusts. One day, after Tenny picked his nephew up from swimming practice, the boy begged him for some ice cream. After a stop at Dairy Queen, they got back in the car with their ice cream and the young boy innocently licked Tenny's face to get a taste of Tenny's vanilla ice cream. Tenny returned the favor, but soon started licking more and more of his nephew's young body until he had pulled the kid's pants down and raped him.

Ian grew up in one of Britain's council houses (the equivalent of an American housing project). His father was a violent drunk who always came home from the pub in a dangerous state. As Ian matured, he was the only one of his friends who never touched alcohol. Finally, he got up the courage to leave home, moved to London, and got a job in a nice restaurant. Upon moving to New York, he continued to work at bettering himself and eventually started dating an attractive woman from Greenwich, Connecticut. On the night she threw a birthday party for him in his own apartment, Ian had two glasses of wine. He was fucking a stranger in the bathroom when his girlfriend walked in on them. Like his father, he erupted and became a violent, sadistic drunk. Mikey fell in love with books at an early age and spent long hours at the library to avoid the toxic atmosphere at home. Books became his safety net, taking him to faraway places and on grand adventures as he put himself through college and eventually got a job working with runaway children. One night, his assistant didn't show up at the shelter where he worked, so he had to cook dinner for the kids (one of whom kept calling him ""98 cent Mike"" and teasing Mike because he was a ""trick baby""). Suddenly, Mike snapped, spanked the living daylights out of the kid, and barely even knew what had come over him. Another young boy grew up watching his mother and her friends take turns going into the bathroom where they should shoot up before reemerging in a very sleepy state. Occasionally his mother would get better, but soon her new boyfriend started shooting up as well. The boy tried to protect his baby sister but, one day, the infant saw what her mother was doing and tried to mimic her behavior. In the process, the young girl ate the contents of a small bag of white powder and died of an overdose. Even today, the older brother feels guilty for the girl's death and misses her terribly.

Orlandersmith's writing is powerful, beautifully edited, and goes to very dark places that some theatregoers may not want to visit with her. A former social worker who once was employed at a shelter for runaway children, she paints devastating portraits of children whose youth and innocence were stolen from them by irresponsible adults.
Chay Yew, who directed the piece with acute sensitivity to pacing, was helped tremendously by Ben Stanton's subtle lighting and Mikhail Fiksel's sound design. Unlike many monologues (which are performed on rather shallow stages), Daniel Ostling's angular unit set reached far upstage into the heart of darkness, despair, depravity, and degradation in which these children were raised.
Black N Blue Boys/Broken Men is a riveting evening anchored by Orlandersmith's hypnotic power as a storyteller. Here's the trailer:

His twisted visions include ""Transvestite Nazi Cannibal Sadismo Asylum of the Damned,"" an imaginary film with the tagline ""Bloodthirsty ladyboys of the Third Reich,"" in which fishnet-clad S.S. soldiers spew blood from gaping maws. 

Irreverent yet pulsing with obsession, Fox's depictions of iconoclasts from Francis Bacon to Johnny Cash exposes the ways in which lives are transformed into legends. Fox rips these figures from their context and tampers with cultural signifiers like a boozed up plastic surgeon. 
Author Richard Milward wrote of Fox's work: ""His pieces are like illustrations for an imaginary game of Chinese whispers, played between the Ghosts of Bohemia Past, Present, and Yet to Come. Like a shot of absinthe to the brain, they enlighten and mystify in equal measure, in the most eye-popping ways imaginable.""

HP: Your work often touches on the relationship between mythology and technology. How has the web altered our relationship to symbols and myths?
NF: I don't go on Facebook or any of those things because I find it all a bit scary. These days people are constantly using all that stuff to self-mythologize ad nauseum, projecting virtual versions of their lives. Maybe in the future it will be like that film Wall-E, with everyone floating around obese with computer screens strapped to their faces, but with more masturbation. As J.G. Ballard wrote: ""Sex times technology equals the future."" 
HP: Your work deals with a lot of pop culture icons and weirdos. Who are you obsessed with in the current pop world?
NF: There's this guy you might have heard of called David Bowie. I am very into him at the moment, or more specifically, the idea of Ziggy Stardust. In England he is all over the media right now because of his new album; he is more of a national institution than the Queen. I'm reading a great book called ""Ziggyology"" by Simon Goddard, which connects all the different influences that fed into the Frankenstein's monster of Ziggy, from Kabuki theatre to Vince Taylor to H.G. Wells. Its a bit like ""Lipstick Traces"" by Griel Marcus but not as highbrow.

240,DIVORCE,How to Recover From Divorce: Stop Playing the Victim!,"Jackie Pilossoph, Contributor
Creator, Divorced Girl Smiling",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-recover-from-divorce_us_5b9d66a1e4b03a1dcc878d4a,"The word victim means ""somebody hurt or killed or harmed or duped."" So, according to that definition, is everyone who gets divorced a victim?",2013-08-02,FAMILY,"When I was first getting divorced, I was beyond depressed. I was sad, I was scared, but mostly I was angry. 'Why did this happen to me? ' and 'It's not fair' were constantly going through my mind. I felt like a victim, and honestly, I was playing one. Until I learned how to recover from divorce: Stop. Just stop. Stop playing the victim.
The word victim means ""somebody hurt or killed or harmed or duped."" So, according to that definition, is everyone who gets divorced a victim? The answer, in my opinion is yes, you are a victim. You are hurt, you've been harmed. You have been lied to or cheated on or treated badly or called names or dumped.
Because you are a victim, I think it's normal, healthy even, to grieve, feel angry, and feel sorry for yourself. FOR A LITTLE WHILE, that is. If you truly want to recover from your divorce, there comes a time when playing the victim needs to stop, and it's time to pick yourself up off the floor, dust yourself off and start your new life. I'm not trying to make it sound simple or easy. It's not. But, you have two choices. Play the victim and blame everyone else for the rest of your life, or go out and grab the life you want. And THAT is a simple choice, isn't it?
I recently got an email from a reader with three young children whose husband left her for another woman. ""I just put my house on the market and I can't pay my bills,"" she wrote. ""I'm really scared. I hate that man so much, I wish he was dead! I can't believe he did this to me. Because of him I haven't worked in 10 years, and now I can't find a job. No one wants to hire me. I hope he and his wife burn in hell.""
I wrote the woman back, telling her I was really sorry about her situation. I then asked her what field she as in before she stopped working.
She wrote back, ""I was a financial adviser and was really successful. I quit because the *ucker wanted me to be a stay at home mom. I gave up everything for him.""
I wrote her back and said, ""Look, it must be very frustrating. That said, let me help you. You need a job. Tell me more specifically what you'd like to do, and I will connect you with some people in the industry. I have 500 LinkedIn friends, and I can put out some feelers for you.""
Know what her response was? Not, ""Thank you so much! Here's what I would like to do..."" Or ""Let me get my resume together and I'll be in touch."" Instead, she wrote back, ""Do you know he has over a million dollars in his savings account? He's living in this huge house, enjoying a great life, and supporting the woman's son, while I can't even pay my mortgage!""
She never even acknowledged my offer. In other words, discussing getting a job and supporting herself wasn't as important to her as expressing blame and her hatred for him.
The woman is clearly not ready to stop playing the victim. I wish I could put a magic spell on her so she would say, ""Okay, what happened to me truly stinks, and it wasn't fair at all, but that's out of my control. I have three healthy children who love me, I'm beautiful, I have the ability to be successful professionally, and if I have the guts to put myself out there, my opportunities are endless, both professionally and personally.""
Instead, she's being the martyr. Her focus is solely on her ex-husband (who don't get me wrong, I would love to punch in the face) but she's all about wanting people to feel sorry for her and hate her ex-husband, when she could be getting herself together, and making plans for her future. She doesn't realize that when she stops the fury, doors will open up.
I want to add that I know how hard it is, not only to figure out a career that works with kids, but to get in the door of any company after not working for a long stretch of time. I have been there. Before I got my jobs, I had so many rejection emails I couldn't even count them all. It's hard, but you have to be persistent and strong and display an obnoxious amount of perseverance. That's just the way it is.
Here's the scariest part about playing the victim. People who don't get out of that mindset end up miserable for the rest of their lives. Not playing the victim is the difference between a hard life and a life of bliss. I swear by that.
I know a woman who has played the victim for 45 years. She is still blaming her ex-husband for everything in her life that isn't going well (which is everything.) She never got over the hatred, the bitterness and blaming her ex husband for leaving her, so she made bad choices, she didn't have self love, and therefore could never prosper professionally, or in personal relationships.
The thing is, it's okay to play the victim for a little while. But at some point, it not only becomes unproductive, but it will destroy you, and it will ruin any chance you have at happiness.
The opposite of ""victim"" is ""criminal"" or ""culprit"" so I don't want to tell people to be the opposite of a victim. But, in a sense, yes, be the opposite. Be the culprit (which technically means ""the accused person."") Be accused of pursuing your dreams, finding things you love to do, having as much fun with your children as you possibly can. Be accused of going out on dates, traveling too much, smiling excessively. You're only a victim until you decide you're not one anymore.

241,DIVORCE,6 Things That Keep You From Moving on After Divorce,"Lisa Arends, Contributor
Author, wellness coach, and math teacher",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/6-things-that-keep-you-from-moving-on_us_5b9dfc90e4b03a1dcc8ff342,"Forgiveness isn't a pardon. It acknowledges the wrongs and then wraps them in compassion and acceptance. Forgiveness is an inside job, quietly accepting the apology you never received. Forgiveness is a difficult road. But you're worth it.",2014-04-16,FAMILY,"You say that you want to move on, putting the divorce behind you and getting on with your life. You claim that you want to feel better, to stop crying and start living. Perhaps you even announce that you're over your ex and that you're ready to start looking for someone new. 
Yet that desired progress isn't happening.
The life you envision isn't unfolding and instead, you find yourself stuck. Anchored in the muck and mire of the divorce. Not a member of your old life, yet not yet fully living in your new one. 
It's easy to make excuses for why you can't seem to move on. You're angry, and rightfully so, that your life plan turned out to be written in disappearing ink. Maybe your ex cheated, stealing your ability to trust along with your imagined future. Perhaps your bank account is anemic and all of your energy has to go to replenishing its stores. You might have endured horrible court battles that wounded you and your children. You may be adjusting to life as a single parent or a sole breadwinner. 
But those are all excuses, bindings that keep you lashed to the past. After all, it's easier to say, ""I can't move on because of (insert favorite excuse here)"" rather than shouldering the responsibility of moving on by yourself.
So, here is your metaphorical slap across the face. This is the advice you've needed to hear, but your friends and family are too nice to say it. But I'm not your friend. I'm someone who has been there, done that and now makes the T-shirts. I'm okay with making you a little angry if it helps to make you better. 
I'm also not going to tell you to ""get over it."" I find that phrase insulting and shortsighted, only uttered by people who have never felt a certain depth of pain or who prefer to bury it rather than address it. But even though there are some things you don't just ""get over,"" you don't have to let them hold you back. 
If you're having trouble moving on, you're probably doing at least one of these things wrong. 
Forgiveness
My response to people encouraging me to forgive was one of indignation. How could I be expected to forgive? He deserved all of the wrath I could send his way and then some. How dare someone tell me I should let that go? 
But they were right. By refusing to forgive, I wasn't hurting him. I was hurting me. I was allowing myself to be a prisoner to his actions and allowing them to dictate my feelings. Forgiving him was a gift of peace to myself.
Forgiveness isn't a pardon. It acknowledges the wrongs and then wraps them in compassion and acceptance. Forgiveness is an inside job, quietly accepting the apology you never received. 
Forgiveness is a difficult road. But you're worth it.
Grasping
When we lose everything, it is human nature to grasp onto whatever remains. And, often in the case of divorce, what is left is the pain. And so we hold onto that pain, claim it. Own it. Defend it. Even feed it. 
That pain can become our identity. I remember how I would receive care and kindness when I was hurting, yet would be comparatively ignored when I was not. It's tempting to stay in pain, to allow others to continuously nurture our wounded hearts. 
But is that really what you want? To be the hurt one? The weak one? To be so determined to lay claim to your pain that you do allow anything or anyone else in? Releasing that pain is strangely scary. It's willingly loosening your grip on your past and trusting that you'll land safely. 
Let go. It's worth it.
Associations
Do you have triggers that are like a time warp to the past, pulling you back to moments of agony and anxiety? I do. In fact, I would say this has been my greatest challenge -- learning to respond from the present and not from the past. 
Even though some healing is passive, slowly softening with the passage of time, triggers are often more resistant. They take repeated attention and deliberate action to remediate. Triggers and associations are not inevitable; you can retrain your brain.
It takes work. But you're worth it.
Replication
One of the most difficult parts of divorce is that at the same time you're mourning your past and present, you're also grieving the loss of the future you thought you would have. Maybe you're lucky and you're life is relatively untouched. Or, maybe you're like me and you were left with only the clothes on your back. 
Regardless of your situation, it is important to not try to recreate what you had. You'll fail. My situation was unusual in that I never spent time in a decaying marriage. So, after he left, I stated I wanted to same thing again (well, without the bigamy and hidden life!). Only there were two problems with that. First, I would always be disappointed because no person and no relationship would exactly fill the shoes left behind from the first. Secondly, I was no longer the same person and so my desires and needs had shifted.
Just because something is different, does not mean that it is worse. Rather than fight against change, learn to be grateful for the hidden gifts within. 
Just because your future isn't the one you wanted, doesn't mean you can't make it beautiful. 
Dream it. And then do it. You're worth it.
Isolation
This is more of a problem for us introverts, but anyone can fall sway to the call of isolation after divorce. We're wounded and often ashamed, wanting to hide our vulnerabilities from the rest of the world. Our self-esteem may have taken a blow and further rejection is too scary to risk.
It seems safer to tuck away from prying eyes until the new skin has formed over the exposed rawness. Safer in the short run, perhaps, but deadly in long term. When you isolate yourself, you lose out on the important perspective provided by others. Your social anxieties grow, making future connections even more difficult. And perhaps worst of all, you give up on the support that others can offer.
It's scary to put yourself out there, to risk being hurt or rejected. But connection with others is what life is all about. You're too special to hide. 
Take the chance on opening up to others. It's worth it.
Self Care
This is often the biggest struggle for single parents. You may now bear the sole burden of your children's well-being and so you push your own care to the side. You know that your oxygen mask comes first but no parent can watch his or her child suffer while standing by. 
But part of your responsibility as a parent is to teach your children how to take care of themselves. If all they see is you sacrificing yourself for others, they will emulate that in their own relationships. It is okay to be both a parent and a person; they don't have to be mutually exclusive.
Furthermore, in order to be the best parent you can be, you have to be the best person you can be. And that means taking care of yourself and your needs. Make your diet, your exercise, your sleep and your social time a priority. 
You're worth it.
You can move on. The bindings holding you back are the excuses kicked up by your own mind. And they only keep you bound if you let them. Moving on doesn't happen when the calendar cycles to a certain date or when a certain event transpires.
Moving on occurs when you take the responsibility to make it happen.
Just because there are some things you don't simply ""get over,"" it doesn't mean you have to let them hold you back.

245,DIVORCE,The Relationship Advice That Wrecked My Marriage,"Laura Doyle, Contributor
New York Times Bestselling Author,  America's Most-Trusted Int...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-relationship-advice-t_us_5b9d17fde4b03a1dcc84639a,"Here are the three most common, unhelpful pieces of relationship advice along with what I now know are more productive alternatives.",2013-05-11,FAMILY,"Every Sunday on my radio show, I give out ""The Worst Relationship Advice of the Week Award"". There's never a shortage of bad advice to choose from, and most of it sounds like harmless conventional wisdom. But bad relationship advice is harmful. I know from applying some of these ineffective suggestions early in my marriage marriage and nearly getting divorced as a result.
Of course, the real reason I give out this award is not just to point and laugh at people --although I enjoy that too -- but for the purpose of highlighting the simple skills that have helped thousands of women restore the excitement, passion and fun in their relationships.
Here are the three most common, unhelpful pieces of relationship advice along with what I now know are more productive alternatives:
1. Institute a date night
Golly, why didn't I think of that? That's right up there with weight-loss tips like ""just eat less"" or financial advice like, ""live below your means."" If life were that easy nobody would need advice.
But the noxious subtext of this vacuous advice is that to stay married, you should add ""go on a date"" to your list of chores, right between ""scrub toilets"" and ""clean the garage."" Yay! It reminds me of another unhelpful axiom: ""Marriage is hard work."" But with the right skills, marriage is not drudgery.  This date-night maxim is truly terrible advice because nobody ever felt special and loved when her husband said, ""We should go out once a week to work on our marriage."" A wife who says that to her husband is likely to be met with resistance to date nights because they reek of control and sound like a chore.
If you're not exactly enjoying each others' company, how would going out for dinner and a movie change that anyway? Wouldn't you just have a tense night out instead of a tense night in? And wouldn't that make you feel even more hopeless?
Here's a more effective practice for re-establishing connection: Instead of a weekly date-night, consider thanking your spouse three times a day for things he does to lighten your load or to delight you. Does he work hard to support the family? Thank him -- even if you work too. Did he start a load of whites? Say ""thanks."" Did he haul the garbage cans to the curb? Let him know you appreciate that.
This simple habit does double-duty for restoring connection because it not only helps you focus on what you're grateful for about your spouse, it also inspires him to find more ways to please you -- once he knows you appreciate his efforts.
2. Communication is the key to a good relationship  The reason this advice is terrible is because we women typically understand it to mean that we need to talk more to get our man to understand. If we could just get him to sit down and talk about his feelings for hours, we think that would fix everything. This feeds into the female fantasy that if our husbands would just do what we've been trying to tell them to do, everything would be fine. Most husbands would rather eat old horse blankets than have that conversation.
If your husband avoids conversations about your relationship, you might worry that it's because he's defective, and that for some reason, you didn't notice until after you were married.
Relationships benefit greatly when you don't communicate everything you're thinking, especially if it's critical or disrespectful.
Instead of trying to force a conversation with your husband, consider focusing on what's true for you and expressing it without criticism. Phrases like, ""I miss you,"" when you're lonely will do more for your connection as a couple than a complaint like, ""we never spend any time together."" Saying ""ouch!"" instead of ""you're really oblivious and insensitive!"" when he hurts your feelings will go a long way toward keeping the peace and preserving the emotional safety, which is critical to intimacy.
And here's some marriage advice you don't often hear: When you find yourself tempted to correct your husband or tell him what he's doing wrong, zipping your lips until the urge passes.
3. You should go to marriage counseling
I know a divorced advice columnist who is always suggesting this. It didn't work for her, but she hasn't given up hope that it will work for somebody else.
There's nothing wrong with wanting professional help, and we've all been taught that marriage counselors are where we should turn when the relationship has left Happily-Ever-After Highway. 
But I, for one, have lost my faith in a diploma as a reliable sign of relationship wisdom. Doubt crept in the day I glimpsed the inside of our counselor's marriage and saw her horrifying contempt and disrespect for her husband. It was confirmed the umpteenth time a client told me that her marriage counselor shamed her into getting a divorce, or listened to her complain about her guy every week for a year and never asked her to make any changes. Another counselor told my client she herself was getting divorced and recommended her client figure out where all the assets were immediately.
Granted, some divorces are necessary. If you're not safe, you have to get out. 
But instead of taking advice from someone who studied relationships academically, consider checking for the most important credential of all: A happy relationship. Only a woman who actually enjoys the ease and pleasure of a great connection with her husband can tell you how to have that. But there's a pretty good chance such a woman knows a few things that will help, even if you think your situation is hopeless. 
Maybe you've just been following the wrong advice.

246,DIVORCE,PTSD After Divorce,"Lisa Arends, Contributor
Author, wellness coach, and math teacher",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ptsd-after-divorce_us_5b9cbd0de4b03a1dcc815f99,"When my husband left, I trembled for a year. That's not just some figurative language used to convey emotion; I literally shook. For a year.",2013-01-30,FAMILY,"When my husband left, I trembled for a year. That's not just some figurative language used to convey emotion; I literally shook. For a year. My body quaked from the aftershocks of the sudden trauma, my legs constantly kicking and my hands quivering. Those weren't my only symptoms, either. I had flashbacks and nightmares that took me back to the to the day where I received the text that ended my marriage. The 21-word incoming message read: ""I am sorry to be such a coward leaving you this way but I am leaving you and leaving the state."" From then on, the sound of an incoming message would actually send me to the floor, where I braced myself for another digital attack. I felt numb and had trouble remembering aspects of my marriage or my husband. I avoided sights and sounds that were associated with my marriage, often driving well out of my way to steer clear of my old neighborhood. I couldn't sleep; I was hyper alert, always scanning every room and ready to fight or flee at any moment. I could not eat and my weight fell to dangerous levels. 
As far as I know, my life was never in actual danger. But apparently my mind and body never received that message. In an instant, the person I trusted the most became someone whom I feared. I felt threatened and unsafe. I didn't know what was real and who to trust. My husband never forced himself upon me, but I felt as though I had been violated when I learned I had been sleeping with the enemy. He never physically hit me, but the psychological blows left scars just the same. I've never been to war, yet every interaction with his lawyer was a battle that left me paralyzed with fear for my ability to survive. 
I by no means intend to trivialize the horrors endured by those who have been the victims of abuse or those have been through war. Those are traumas on a scale well above what I have endured. What I have come to realize, however, is that trauma can come in many forms and in many degrees. The psychiatrist I saw that first year after my divorce stopped short of diagnosing me with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), but the term came up as I described my symptoms, and the medications she prescribed are frequently used in the treatment of PTSD. Another therapist I saw also mentioned the disorder and used complimentary strategies. 
PTSD happens when your mind cannot process the extent of the trauma. It's like a short circuit in your nervous system, where you have trouble distinguishing between real and perceived threats. We tend to think of PTSD as occurring only in life-threatening situations, but it can occur anytime there is an acute or prolonged trauma. Not all divorces lead to PTSD, but if it is sudden or abusive, the trauma can be severe and sudden enough to lead to PTSD-like symptoms.
According to The National Institute of Mental Health, PTSD includes flashbacks, bad dreams, staying away from triggers, feeling emotionally numb, feeling guilty, having trouble with memory, being easily startled, feeling tense and angry. Additionally, the diagnosis of PTSD requires that the symptoms persist beyond 30 days and that they interfere with daily life. There is a difference between normal grief, shock and anxiety and the pathology of PTSD. 
PTSD occurs when a perfect storm of conditions are met. First, prior traumas can ""prime"" someone for PTSD as the stress can actually cause epigenetic changes, rewiring the body to be extra sensitive to further trauma. Women are also more likely to experience PTSD, possibly due to heightened fear conditioning. PTSD is also more likely to occur when traumas accumulate. When someone who has some of these risk factors undergoes a divorce, particularly one that is sudden or especially toxic, PTSD-like symptoms can occur. Sudden abandonment or attack by a loved one can trigger panic and disorientation as real as any physical threat. 
During my divorce, I learned that most people assumed that depression would be the disorder de jour after a break up. They expected me to be sad and withdrawn, curled up on my bed with a box of tissues and endless pints of ice cream. Instead, I was hyper vigilant and always on the lookout for the next blow. It's important to realize that all divorces are not the same and we all respond differently. There is no ""right"" way to be after a divorce. I was embarrassed for a time to reveal the true nature of my symptoms. I felt like I wasn't permitted to feel that way since I didn't have a knife to my throat. I felt ashamed that I couldn't cope with the basics of eating and sleeping. I felt weak every time I over-reacted to a stimulus. Once I admitted my struggles, I was able to actively seek help to overcome them. I also learned that I was not alone in my reaction to the divorce.
There is help for those who are experiencing PTSD-like symptoms after a divorce. First, communicate your symptoms to your doctor or therapist. A checklist can be a useful tool, especially if you are having trouble putting words to your feelings. Be firm. I found that some therapists and doctors didn't really listen to me, rather they projected how they thought I should be feeling. Different therapies, including EMDR, have been shown to be effective against PTSD. There are medications that can be useful to limit the anxiety and to calm the mind and body. Additionally, mindfulness practices, including yoga and meditation, can also help to reset the sympathetic nervous system and regulate the release of stress hormones. 
In my case, medication helped me survive the first year while a combination of mindfulness training, yoga and exercise has alleviated most of the symptoms permanently. I still have moments of unexplained panic where a slight trigger causes an extreme reaction, but those moments are thankfully few and far between. I no longer feel like I'm a prisoner to my anxieties, trapped in a purgatory where I'm forced to relive those awful moments time and time again. I am now able to visit those memories without panic and live my life without waiting for the next blow. 
I never formally acquired the label of PTSD, but it served to be a valuable framework for me to understand and communicate my symptoms and to eventually overcome them. Labels, such as PTSD, can be helpful as we try to understand a complex situation, but even they only tell part of the story. Be gentle and understanding with yourself and others. Don't be quick to judge or make assumptions. Don't be ashamed to ask for assistance and admit when you cannot do it alone. Seek the help you need and know that it does get better.

If one were to ask Shakespeare what to do, he might say, ""To sell, or not to sell, that is the question.""",2012-03-20,FAMILY,"In the famous words of William Shakespeare, ""All's well that ends well."" When it comes to a marriage, however, this isn't always the case.
Let's start with a few U.S. stats:
- There are approximately 2.5 million marriages in the U.S. every year. - An estimated 80 percent of brides-to-be receive a diamond engagement ring. - The divorce rate is currently 48.6 percent. 
With these numbers in mind, one can imagine how many engagement rings end up on the market for sale, repurposing or in a toilet bowl. For those interested in the more sensational, here are some of the most famous celebrity jewelry sales.
In an effort to help divorcees understand their jewelry (and what they can do with it in the time of a divorce), I put together the following list:
1. Know who is entitled to the jewelry The rightful owner is determined by several factors including how it was given, local jurisdiction and reason for marital dissolution. A first good step is to consult a family attorney to determine ownership.
2. Be emotionally ready Whether you decide to sell it, repurpose it or keep it, make sure you are emotionally ready to go through the process. It is not always a walk in the park. If you decide to sell it, it can be the most difficult (or most easy) step depending on the situation.
3. Keep it in a safe place Keep it safe (in a safe). Whether you put it in your safe at home or at the bank, don't be a victim of a sock-drawer disappearance.
4. Know what it's worth Most jewelry stores or buyers will be able to give you a rough estimate of what your jewelry is worth. Make sure to shop it around to get a realistic and worthwhile estimate.
5. Know how to get top dollar for it if you decide to sell it Getting the maximum value for your jewelry requires understanding its worth and finding the best buyer for it. Chose a reputable buyer who has a good rating with the Better Business Bureau. This can be a very confidential endeavor so consider choosing a jewelry buyer in a private setting.
All in all, the good news is that the owner of a jewelry asset has the choice to do with it what he or she wishes. If one were to ask Shakespeare what to do, he might say, ""To sell, or not to sell, that is the question.""

In fact, they go on vacations together. Richards said in the interview, ""He knows I don't judge him and he knows that I will be there for him no matter what -- and vice versa."" 
When you are going through a divorce, you probably could never think of being friends with your ex. If you have children together, you need to both think about what's best for them. If you are arguing with your ex after the divorce is final, look at why you're still not getting along. If each parent is doing what they are supposed to according to the divorce agreement and for the children, then there should be no hostility. It begins with both exes working together for the benefit of the kids. Here are some things to keep in mind as you co-parent with your ex-spouse. 
Get On With Your Lives: The both of you need to forget about the bad things that happened during your marriage. Now it's time to get on with your lives for the well-being of your children. 
Learn to Like Each Other Again: Things went badly in your marriage, but don't forget that you liked each other at one time. Try to be friends again. It can only help toward making a peaceful existence for the kids. 
Alleviate the Pressure: You probably spent a long time with your ex-spouse trying to make your marriage work. Now that you're divorced, the pressure is off the two of you. 
Communicate More: Two spouses not communicating is one of the big reasons a marriage ends. Speak to each other and let the other one know what you're feeling with regard to the kids. 
Don't Annoy Each Other: You certainly know what annoys your ex and your ex knows what bothers you. It's easier to make it work between you both when you keep those things in mind. 
Think of the Children First: Make sure you and your ex always think of the children first. If you find yourself having a moment of resentment regarding the marriage, consider what is best for the kids. 
Have a Peaceful Night: If your ex does something that's irritating, you don't have to bring the negativity home with you anymore. You get to go to your own bed and have a good night's sleep.

251,DIVORCE,Divorce Confidential: 5 Signs It's Time to Break Up With Your Divorce Attorney,"Caroline Y Choi, Contributor
Foreign Registered Lawyer, (California, USA) at Oldham, Li & Nie",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/divorce-attorney_us_5b9d962be4b03a1dcc89d52e,"3. Your attorney makes unilateral decisions without your input or approval: While your attorney is knowledgeable about the legalities of your case, your input and approval is necessary because the decisions will affect your life.",2013-10-11,FAMILY,"When you're in a rocky relationship, there may come a time when you realize it's in your best interest to break up and move on. Breaking up is hard to do, especially when you're invested in the relationship and the uncertainty of what lies ahead is more daunting than the thought of staying behind. In a divorce, this is especially true since all the comforts of your past are no longer the face of your future. 
In a divorce, you are mourning the death of your relationship and so the last thing you want to worry about is another difficult relationship...but with your divorce attorney. If anything, the legal assistance that you seek and require in this difficult circumstance should somewhat ease the burden of divorce. 
Unfortunately, that is not always the reality for some individuals who are in difficult attorney-client relationships. But how do you know you're in an attorney-client relationship terrible enough to warrant a break-up? 
Here are five signs that it might be time to cut-ties with your divorce attorney and find a better fit for you and your situation:
1. Your attorney blows you off: If your attorney does not return your calls or emails within a reasonable time frame, this may be cause for concern. Communication with your attorney is key in order to move your case forward and to resolution. If he or she refuses to return your calls or answer your questions, it might be time to start looking for alternative representation and find an attorney who will pay attention to you and your concerns. 
2. Your attorney keeps you in the dark about your case: It is not in your best interests if your attorney is not keeping you informed of the details of your case. For example, if you are kept in the dark about communications your attorney is having with your spouse's attorney, or you are not privy to documents being prepared or exchanged on your behalf, then it's time to raise the red flag. You have the right to know what is happening in your case, so demand it. 
3. Your attorney makes unilateral decisions without your input or approval: While your attorney is knowledgeable about the legalities of your case, your input and approval is necessary because the decisions will affect your life. That is why it is important that your attorney consults with you before any major decisions are made about your case. As such, if you do not understand the terms and concepts of what is occurring, it is imperative that you ask your lawyer to explain the process and what it will mean for you and your family now and in the long-term. 
4. You and your attorney don't see eye-to-eye on strategy: In a divorce, you will be faced with very important choices as to how you want your case to proceed. While there may be moments where you and your attorney may disagree, there should be agreement on the overall strategy in terms of bringing your case to resolution. If you are inclined to proceed with a negotiated divorce and your attorney is pushing you towards a litigated one or vice versa, your current attorney-client relationship may not necessarily be the best fit. To avoid any surprises, it's best to discuss your vision from the get-go of your relationship. 
5. Your attorney hasn't researched or prepared for Court: If you get the sense that your attorney doesn't know the details of your case and isn't prepared for Court appearances, it may be prudent to start asking your lawyer questions about his or her lack of preparation. You have hired your attorney to represent your interests and to be your voice. If he or she does not know your case and you're doing much of the legwork, it may be in your best interest to move on to a new attorney-client relationship. 
Remember that in a divorce, you're already dealing with a challenging situation. Your attorney should not make the process more difficult, but rather assist you in navigating the somewhat overwhelming legal system. Like any healthy relationship, communication is key!

252,DIVORCE,5 Lessons I Learned From My Divorce (And Why Seth Adam Smith's Advice In 'Marriage Isn't for You' Doesn't Work),"Peggy Nolan, Contributor
Best selling author, podcaster and traveler",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marriage-isnt-for-you-response_us_5b9da8afe4b03a1dcc8af680,I made my first marriage all about my ex-husband. I tried to be the person he wanted me to be except what he wanted was always a moving target. Guess what? That's right -- after 19 years of tilting at windmills we became just another divorce statistic.,2013-11-15,FAMILY,"When I first read Seth Adam Smith's overly emotional article, Marriage Isn't For You, I didn't get the warm and fuzzies many of you may have gotten. In fact, I felt a little throw up in my mouth. Seth's article hinges on some heartfelt but wonky advice from his father:
Marriage isn't for you. You don't marry to make yourself happy, you marry to make someone else happy. More than that, your marriage isn't for yourself, you're marrying for a family. Not just for the in-laws and all of that nonsense, but for your future children. Who do you want to help you raise them? Who do you want to influence them? Marriage isn't for you. It's not about you. Marriage is about the person you married.
My first marriage lasted 19 years. Once the divorce cloud settled I was able to sort through the lessons I learned.
Lesson 1:  I can't make anyone happy but myself. Happiness is a response to something that happens. How another responds to any given situation is not something I have control over. Happiness is and always will be an inside job. 
Lesson 2: Marriage is about two people, not one or the other. The marriage must be mutually beneficial and add value to both people who invested themselves inside the sacred marriage commitment.
Lesson 3: One person cannot be the constant giver while the other is a constant taker. Marriage requires regular deposits from both partners. 
Lesson 4: If you do not make the time to value yourself no one else will either. 
Lesson 5: If you cannot be who you are inside your marriage and you're constantly morphing into the expectations of other people -- your parents, your spouse, your friends, etc., -- you will end up resentful and most likely divorced.
There are other lessons I learned but these are the lessons that I write about the most often because I carried them with me into my second marriage. The coolest thing is that my husband, Richard, learned similar lessons from his first marriage as well. Try as he might, no matter what he did to make his first marriage about her, it just didn't work. 
Before Richard and I reconnected (we were high school sweethearts), I was perfectly happy being the empty nested, yoga teaching, dog loving, granola eating, 40-something woman that I was. I was very happy with my life. And then Richard showed up. I married Richard not because of family, in-laws, out-laws, or my burning desire to forget about me and make him happy, but because I was truly, madly, deeply in love with him. I don't think Richard asked me to marry him so he could be a door mat and cater to my every whim or fancy. 
Richard doesn't make me happy any more than I make him happy. We are two whole individuals. He is not my better half and I do not complete him. We both have goals, dreams, and aspirations. I do not have to give up who I am so he can realize his dreams. He does not have to dim his light so I can shine brighter than him. When we both shine brightly, we give everyone around us the courage to do the same. 
My ex-husband hated that I had a light that no matter how much I dialed it back, it always came through. My ex-husband hated that I had interests, friends, goals, and dreams outside of him. He wanted to be the sole object of my attention. I made my first marriage all about my ex-husband. I tried to be the person he wanted me to be except what he wanted was always a moving target. Guess what? That's right -- after 19 years of tilting at windmills we became just another divorce statistic. 
Through the lens of my own experience, I can't help but feel sorry for Seth and his wife. Seth most certainly has a lot to learn about marriage.

253,DIVORCE,Many Tragedies In Whitney Houston's Death,"Vicki Larson, Contributor
Co-author of ""The New I Do,"" journalist, mom",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/whitney_us_5b9b5341e4b03a1dcc76a4b9,"Whitney Houston's death Saturday was filled with tragedy. She leaves behind a daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, a promising young singer who at age 18 is way too young to lose a mother.",2012-02-15,FAMILY,"Whether you were a fan or not, Whitney Houston's death Saturday was filled with tragedy.
She was yet another talented entertainer who died way too young; Whitney was just 48. Although drugs, booze or both may possibly have played a part in her untimely death -- Whitney had long struggled with substance abuse -- most people are sympathetic to those who try get themselves clean and sober, as Whitney did, even if with limited success.
Plus she leaves behind a daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, a promising young singer who at age 18 is way too young to lose a mother. 
But there was yet another tragedy that day. Whitney's former husband, Bobby Brown, gave a performance just hours after learning that Whitney had died. Despite being ""visibly shaken"" and offering a no-doubt sincere tribute to his former wife -- declaring, ""I love you, Whitney"" while blowing kisses to the sky while on stage -- the soul singer said he decided to go on with the show because fans of his group New Edition had been loyal for more than 25 years. 
Few would doubt that he had loyal fans to whom he felt a responsibility. But it's hard not to question why that responsibility took precedence over the one he has to his daughter, who has been hospitalized twice since her mother's death. True, he flew late Sunday to Los Angeles to be with Bobbi Kristina, who is now is with family, reports say. But why wouldn't a father drop everything and run immediately to be by his daughter's side after the death of her mother? Even if your marriage was troubled -- and the tumultuous 14 years Bobby and Whitney spent together until their acrimonious 2007 divorce were well documented -- shouldn't a parent's responsibility to his or her child always come first?
Perhaps we shouldn't be too quick to judge. Whitney had full custody of Bobbi, who was just 14 when Whitney and Bobby divorced. The two were very close (even allegedly going to rehab together) -- maybe too close to have a healthy mother-daughter relationship.
""Bobbi Kristina basically grew up (as) her mother's caretaker,"" according to US Weekly editor Ian Drew. ""In a way, she was the adult in (the) relationship.""
No child should be an adult in a parent-child relationship, which sometimes happens in divorced families. Not only does it create a dysfunction, but where does the non-custodial parent, like Bobby, fit into a relationship like that?
Maybe no place. Maybe Bobbi Kristina didn't want her father to comfort her after her mother's death.
As troubled as Whitney and Bobby's marriage may have been, their custody battle wasn't much better. Bobby, who sued Whitney for spousal support, child support and shared custody, claimed he was being shut out of his daughter's life. ""Since Whitney has been awarded sole legal and physical custody of Bobbi Kris, she has attempted to eliminate me from Bobbi Kris' life ... I have not seen or spoken to my daughter since early June and I have no prospect of speaking to her or seeing her anytime soon due to Whitney's actions,"" Brown wrote in 2007.
There are many fathers who can relate to Bobby's story.
Whitney argued that Bobby had been ""almost totally uninvolved"" in taking care of Bobbi Kristina. ""We have a daughter together and I would like him to be involved in her life,"" she said. 
There are many mothers who can relate to Whitney's story.
It's unclear just how involved Bobby had been in Bobbi Kristina's life, before and after the divorce. It's also unclear whether he was allowed to be in Bobbi Kristina's life, either by Whitney or his daughter or both.
And that, if true, is the real tragedy.

I miss them so much it steals my breath. But I'm glad they're there.,2013-07-23,FAMILY,"It has been 21 days since I've seen my children.
When we were mediating our divorce settlement, my ex-husband and I were very concerned with keeping our families connected to our children. We wrote into our settlement that we were each allowed to take the kids for extended summer vacations to see family in different parts of the country, because we wanted our kids to really know their extended families. Family, and time with family, is important.
The practical application of that is that for three-ish weeks every summer, my kids are with their dad, 600+ miles away. (And for another few weeks, they're with me with my family, away from their dad). They're hanging out with cousins and second cousins and grandparents and friends, swimming in the ocean and eating ice cream at the ice cream store their dad remembers from every summer vacation of his life. They are having so much fun that they don't even have time to talk to me when I call: ""Hi, Mom! I love you! I'm going down to the beach with the kids now! Bye!""
I miss them so much it steals my breath. But I'm glad they're there.
I thought, in those last few years of an unhappy marriage, that I was sacrificing toward some higher purpose. That sticking in a situation that was making me sick, that made it almost impossible to get out of bed in the morning, was somehow good for my kids. It wasn't. They were living in a void, with just a shell of a family, with shells of parents.
That long, slow, bruising sacrifice wasn't worth it. But this short, sharp, three-week disorientation sacrifice definitely is. My boys have that time with their dad that they'll never forget in those places they'll never forget. They get to immerse themselves in that half of their family. And they don't have to feel conflicted or like they're somehow betraying me, because I'm genuinely happy that they're there. 
But I'll be happier when they're home. 
A few more days.
Magda runs and writes and reads and writes about writing and reading and running, although she's been doing less running and more writing in this heat wave. She thinks you're the best parent for your child, and writes about that at AskMoxie.org. Read the blog she writes with her ex-husband about co-parenting after divorce at When The Flames Go Up. It gets better. All of it.

Should we be miserable for the rest of our lives because it didn't last?,2012-10-24,FAMILY,"A month ago I wrote a post called ""A Husband, A House, A Mortgage, A Baby and A Lightbulb Moment"" in which I talked about having had what I thought was the ""American Dream"" and how in the end, it didn't feel like the ""prize"" I had imagined it would be.
My marriage ended in divorce. We sold our home. My ex and I are not only not in love, we don't even communicate. Everything I had dreamt of having essentially imploded, leaving me to question most of the values I had held dear in the first half of my life. 
I received over 1,000 comments and attacks on this blog and after awhile, I had to stop reading them. The blog was not meant to say my ex husband was to blame any more than I was. It was not meant to say that marriage, a home and a family are not worthy desires. It was simply to say that for so many of us, life is not one size fits all. We all have different paths. What works so well for so many families does not work for everyone. And that is not the end of the world -- it is simply the beginning of a new world. 
Recently I was in a workshop with several men who talked about their families, their wives and their children. They were so proud and devoted to them, and I felt a pang of envy. To anyone who thought that I was saying that I don't believe in love -- or that I was critical of men -- I apologize. If I didn't believe in love, I wouldn't want to live. Love is, for me, the single most important part of my life. I am surrounded by love and though I do not, at this time, have a partner or a spouse in my life, that doesn't mean that there is no love. 
I love my daughter, deeply. I love my dog, Lucy, who has been with me for over 12 years. We rescued her when she was 4 and even at 16, she's hanging in there. I lost a beloved dog, Lola, a year and a half ago when she was only 9. It still kills me to think of her. I love my friends and my family. I love writing. I love babies. I love New York City. I love this entire country and I also love many other countries. I love ice cream. I love people who can put their beliefs front and center and make a real difference in this world. I love spiritual teachers like Pema Chodron -- she saved my life when everything felt like it was going wrong. I love meditation. (I even feel not completely stupid when I chant now.)
I actually love my ex husband. I just don't want to live with him. And it's pretty clear that he is relieved not to be living with me.
When I was in my 20s and early 30s, I believe that walking down the aisle was the equivalent of my ""Rocky"" moment, climbing up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art in my wedding gown and raising my hands in triumph. I believed that my life was now complete. 
And then I saw how challenging it was to keep a marriage going when two people wanted different things out of it. I wanted simply to have a partner and an ally, to know someone had my back and wanted to spend some time with me. He wanted to come together when he wanted to, and that turned out to be, in the end, not at all. 
I was not right and he was not wrong. It simply was what it was. 
In losing that ""Rocky"" triumph, I found myself. I found that all the external things I thought I wanted were less important than the internal work I had to do. I found a core of strength I didn't know I had, to help my parents die, to be a good friend to others. To try to know God, or whatever that ""higher consciousness"" is. 
I do believe in love. I do believe in marriage and kids and a home and all of those desires of human connection. I just believe that our lives can be complete and joyous without all the external prizes we think we must have. 
Despite a difficult divorce and some very painful losses, the past three years have been some of the best years of my life. Were they better than the early years of my daughter's life, when we were a loving family and we were all together? They were different; not better, not worse. 
It's an amazing feeling to fall in love and plan a wedding and embark on a life with the person you believe is your soul mate. But sometimes the person we chose at 24 or 29 or 37 is not the person we can live with at 40 or 50 or 60. Should we be miserable for the rest of our lives because it didn't last? Or should we move on and accept that life has other plans for us? 
A year ago, I started studying swing dancing because I hoped that dancing would lift my spirits after a horrible divorce. It did. Recently, one of my favorite dance partners told me that I had to go into more challenging classes in order to improve. I think that's true now about love, too. I think it's time to come out of hiding and put my heart on the line again. I'm scared to step on my partner's feet in an advanced intermediate dance class. And I'm also scared to get my heart broken again. But I know that if I don't take chances in life, I might as well just die right now and forget about the remaining days, months or years. Where would be the joy in that? 
After that blog post got so many critical comments, I talked to a few successful writers I know about how they handled criticism and personal attacks. One of them, Michael Eigen, a therapist and author of at least twenty books, said to me, ""If you go out into the world, you will be attacked by others. If you stay in your cave, you will be attacked by yourself.""
I'm ready. I feel that Pat Benatar has taken over my soul and is singing, ""'C'mon and hit me with your best shot... fire away."" 
Which is also a good song to dance to.

256,DIVORCE,Divorce Confidential: Should I Negotiate or Litigate My Divorce?,"Caroline Y Choi, Contributor
Foreign Registered Lawyer, (California, USA) at Oldham, Li & Nie",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/divorce-confidential-shou_us_5b9d8b9ae4b03a1dcc895b62,"Recently, a client reminisced about her excruciating decision to divorce her husband. The couple had been married for almost 20 years and the thought of separating after years of marriage terrified her.",2013-09-25,FAMILY,"Recently, a client reminisced about her excruciating decision to divorce her husband. The couple had been married for almost 20 years and the thought of separating after years of marriage terrified her. In this case, the couple had been fighting for years and this spilled into their divorce proceedings. As a result, their teenage son was essentially catapulted into the center of the divorce action. By the end of the divorce, their son was just as emotionally wrecked as his parents. 
Now the truth of the matter is that while the effects of divorce on your loved ones cannot be completely avoided, it can be somewhat alleviated depending on whether you choose to negotiate your divorce or litigate it. So what is a negotiated divorce and why would most family law attorneys propose this option first over a litigated divorce? Here is a peek into the different ways a negotiated divorce can look like: 
Cooperative Divorce:  In this scenario you and your spouse are each represented by your own attorney. Here, you both can direct your attorneys to work together through settlement negotiations, to reach amicable decisions without ever meeting in a courtroom.
Collaborative Divorce:  In a collaborative divorce, you and your spouse have made a firm commitment to keep matters out of court, and focus on problem solving in a confidential, private setting. Collaborative trained professionals are hired, including attorneys, financial experts and mental health professionals to assist in preserving the financial and emotional resources of your family. 
Mediation: In mediation, you and your spouse are unrepresented and instead meet with a neutral mediator, sit around a table and hammer out the details of your divorce. Rather than have a judge decide your fate and make life-altering decisions, you and your spouse are given the opportunity to carve out a plan that works best for you and your family. 
With those options in mind, here are a few things to consider in determining whether a negotiated divorce is for you: 
Do you and your spouse communicate? If you and your spouse are on talking terms, it is a good sign that you may be able to talk about outstanding issues, especially when it comes to your children and finances.
Do you want to minimize attorney's fees and costs? Negotiated divorces save money because you're not spending money on attorneys (in the case of a mediated divorce), or in cases where you and your spouse each have an attorney, these fees can be minimized since your attorney is not spending time on preparation and paperwork for Court. 
What Are Your Future Plans? Are you looking to get married again...and soon? In a negotiated divorce, much time can be saved if you and your spouse are on the same page. In protracted litigation, divorce proceedings can be drawn out for years, and in some cases, drawn out for a period longer than you were even married! 
Do You and Your Spouse Still Respect Each Other? The love and romance may have evaporated, but if the respect is still intact, a negotiated divorce may be a good option. If you and your spouse respect each other, the likelihood of bringing your child into the divorce is minimal and it helps to maintain a harmonious post-divorce friendship. 
How Important Is Privacy To You? Another thing to consider is how much privacy you require in your divorce. In a litigated divorce, the paperwork you file is an open public record. What that means is any dirty laundry that is aired out in your paperwork can be read and reviewed by any member of the public.
Negotiated divorces will help alleviate the pain and stress of a divorce. However, that it is not always an option if your spouse is simply unwilling to participate in proceedings. In such circumstance, a litigated divorce may be your only option. While your patience will be tested in a litigated divorce, there are actions you can take to move the process forward to reach your ultimate goal:
Keep Your Kids Out Of It: Don't talk to your kids about the divorce. This includes venting and criticizing the other parent to your child. Don't let your kids read legal paperwork or have it lying around the house for them to accidentally find. In fact, you might try saying a few kind words about the other parent. Kindness is a good thing.
A Little Compromise Goes A Long Way: You might be surprised that when you take a few steps towards compromise, your spouse may be willing to meet you, even if it's only a little bit. Divorce is a process and one little step still means that you're moving one step further towards your ultimate goal.
Reach Out And Talk Things Out: While this may not always be a realistic option (such as in Restraining Order cases), it may be something to consider if you want to move from a litigated divorce to a negotiated one.
Try and Understand Your Spouse's Point of View: Take one minute to consider your spouse's point of view. Your spouse may be proposing something reasonable. So taking the time to understand their point of view, may help alleviate the pressure.

When you start to feel overwhelmed, take it one hurdle at a time. Husband and wife team Jennifer and Jason said they handle",2014-03-21,FAMILY,"As part of our Blended Family Friday series, each week we're spotlighting a different stepfamily to learn how they successfully blended their two families. Our hope is that by telling their stories, we'll bring you closer to blended family bliss in your own life!
Want to know real stress? Get married, have kids, then get divorced and settle down with someone with kids of their own. From conflicts in custody agreements to vindictive former spouses edging their way into household drama, there's no shortage of stress in the lives of blended family parents. 
So what can stepparents do to reduce some of the tension in their lives? Below, we look back at some of the best advice the parents in our Blended Family Friday series have shared with us in the past. See what they had to say, then head to the comments and add your best advice on beating stress in a blended family. 
1. Figure out a co-parenting plan with your spouse early on. Parenting someone else's kids is not easy -- and those first few years are usually the toughest. That said, the road to peaceful relations with your new stepkid will be a lot less rocky if you and your spouse are able to come to an agreement on how you'll parent, including who will be in charge of discipling. 
Stepmom Janice Bissell figured this out with her husband early on in their marriage.""[My husband] gave me fairly free reign on structure and discipline for his youngest, CJ, and he always backed me up."" 
On bigger issues with her stepkids, though, Bissell said her husband is the decider -- and she's fine with that. ""I've also learned to give up control, which has been so hard, but ultimately a very good and necessary thing for our family,"" she said.
2. When you start to feel overwhelmed, take it one hurdle at a time.   Husband and wife team Jennifer and Jason said they handle stress the same way any non-blended family would. The only difference? The stress that comes their way includes ""slow family courts, pricey parenting coordinators and difficult exes."" 
So how do they deal? ""Stress is stress. We eat the elephant one bite at a time like everybody else,"" Jennifer said. ""We keep an open forum for communication across the board and spend a great deal of time being together so our bond is strong and valuable. No matter how stressful any of our situations become, we never lose sight of our main goal, which is to experience joy."" 
3. See your family -- including the exes -- as a team. Having an ""us against them"" mentality is the best way to sabotage your attempts to blend your family or get along with your ex, said Prentiss Earl, a father of two who's still close with his ex-wife and her new family. 
""I'd argue that our situation was more stressful when we maintained a separatist attitude with our individual households,"" he told us. ""I don't feel family-related stress as much as I used to because of the way we've come together as a team.""
4. Invest in a chore chart.  If you want to see chores actually get done in your home, it's time to buy a big white chore board, said stepmom Raiye Rosado. ""Use a chore chart, for the love of all that's good in the world. Seriously, it changed everything.""

5. Remind yourself to celebrate even the smallest of victories.  Your oldest and youngest bond while building a pillow fort. You and your wife managed to coordinate your custody agreements so you could plan a mini vacation in the fall. Small wins like this are worth celebrating, said blended family mom Andi Parker-Kimbrough. ""Live one day at a time (or one moment if you have to),"" she said. ""Blend little by little and celebrate even the smallest breakthrough."" 
6. Whatever you do, don't aim for perfection.  No nuclear family is perfect, so why should any blended family strive to be? Our reader Kellee Mulkerin-Ford told us that the first step in making progress as a blended family is to lower your expectations a bit. ""Stop thinking that things are going to be perfect. It's not going to happen,"" she said. ""The kids will not get along all the time, the house will be not always be quiet, you will not always hear 'please' and 'thank you.'"" 
Instead, she recommended that parents take a more sensible approach to blending. ""What is realistic is taking stock of how incredibly lucky you are to have more children to love and to guide.""

In fact, in 2005, Gerald F. Phillips, Esq. wrote and article titled, ""The Obligation of Attorneys to Inform Clients about ADR."" In that article, he stated, ""There appears to be a growing view that lawyers should discuss ADR with clients."" At the time he wrote that article the American Bar Association's Model Rule on the subject was Rule 2.1, which provided as follows: ""In representing a client, a lawyer shall exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice. In rendering advice, a lawyer may refer not only to law but to other considerations such as moral, economic, social and political factors, that may be relevant to the client's situation."" At that time, the Rule was considered somewhat of a joke because by using the word ""may,"" it failed to mandate anything. Nevertheless, Virginia imposed a mandatory obligation on attorneys to advise clients of the ""advantages, disadvantages, and availability of dispute resolution processes."" Unfortunately, other states enacted Rules which were as weak as the American Bar Association's Model Rule. Sadly, little has changed since that time and the American Bar Association's Model Rule is still exactly the same. 
In 2005, Gerald F. Phillips wrote the following: ""The client faces the greatest consequences of any decision regarding the means of resolving a legal dispute. Yet typically the client is not informed of alternatives to litigation unless the matter is court ordered, requested by an opposing disputant or required by a contractual provision.... Clients are most often in the best position to determine what is in their best interests. Clients know how important it may be to preserve the relationship with the other party. A court decision may destroy a relationship that may be very important to the client. The client, not the attorney should decide whether to use mediation. The attorney may, for legal, strategic or other reasons, want the matter to go to court while the client may desire that an effort be made to settle the controversy though mediation. The client is often unable to make such a decision without the attorney explaining the processes. Some clients do not even know that mediation and arbitration are available. For the decision to be meaningful the client must have a full understanding of the various ADR options.... Many trial lawyers have come to consider themselves as 'resolvers of disputes,' not merely gladiators to do combat in the courts. And though ADR is now central to the practice of law, there will not be complete acceptance of ADR until clients, the public and all members of the professional fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of the various forms of ADR.""
On December 14, 2009, John M. Delehanty, Esq. published an article titled ""Do Attorneys Have An Ethical Obligation To Discuss ADR With Their Clients Under the Professional Conduct Rules & When Do They Have To Do It?"" In that article, he stated, ""There is no consensus about whether lawyers have an ethical obligation to discuss ADR with their clients.... The majority of state ethics codes suggest, but to do not require, that lawyers discuss ADR with clients.... Many states' ethics rules relating to legal fees and the client's right to control litigation decisions suggest that lawyers have an implicit ethical obligation to discuss ADR with their clients.... While state ethics rules do not explicitly requires lawyers to discuss ADR with their clients, many courts require parties and their counsel to confer, or at least to sign certifications affirming that they have conferred, about resolving litigation through ADR. Implicit obligations alone do not provide sufficient incentives for lawyers to include ADR in the range of options which they present to their clients. To make sure that lawyers do in fact inform their clients of the availability of ADR, the states should require lawyers to consult with their clients about ADR and obtain informed consent from the clients concerning the dispute resolution method they wish to pursue.""
In 2011, I had the pleasure of hearing Tobias Desjardins, the Director & Founder of the International Center for Peaceful Shared Custody, speak. During his talk, he mentioned that families are frequently referred to him by judicial officers when a child becomes suicidal as a result of their parents protracted custody battle. He told us that by the time he sees these families, both parents have worked with several different attorneys and that they have consistently told him that the first time they learned about mediation or collaborative divorce was through him. This reality is not only indicative of unethical conduct by family law attorneys, but it is just plain tragic.
In 2012, I took part in a discussion of family law on the Los Angeles County Bar Association's Family Law Section Listserv. After one lawyer pointed out that ""the code of ethics requires attorneys to advise their clients about mediation possibilities,"" a number of others chimed in with reason after reason for opposing the use of mediation in family law cases. Eventually I spoke up. ""Why is it that mediation and collaborative divorce is very successful in other countries (such as the U.K.), and in some states in the U.S., but the family law litigation community here seems to have a completely different impression? Is it that people in Los Angeles somehow differ from people everywhere else?"" Disappointingly-but not surprisingly-no one even acknowledged my question.
However, even if lawyers were required to discuss the various ADR options with their clients, how would they effectively do so if they don't fully understand those processes? For example, the Mediation Descriptions by the Maryland Program for Mediator Excellence specifically provides as follows: ""'Evaluative Mediation' is not defined here because we believe it is a misnomer. Evaluation is a technique, not a mediation framework. If a process consists solely of an evaluation and attempts to get participants in line with the evaluation, then that process is not mediation, it is more likely a settlement conference."" I have referred to ""evaluative mediation"" as an alternative form of litigation and others refer to it as ""soft arbitration."" Regardless of how it is described, it is not mediation. Unfortunately, however, the legal community in many states including California, emphasize the use of ""evaluative mediation"" and it is the preferred method of mediation. In fact, they don't even need to distinguish it because that is basically the only form of ""mediation"" used by the vast majority of the legal community. In fact, as recently as August 18, 2013, many in the mediation community were discussing just this issue. They were expressing frustration over the fact that little has changed over the past several decades. The consensus was that public education was the answer. As I like to remind people, you can only give what you have and teach what you know. If the legal community won't embrace ADR, maybe an educated public can force the issue.

In Google's quest to capture the world's streets, the cameras fastened to their Street View cars have caught everything from motorcycle accidents and houses on fire, to couples having (most likely simulated) sex. And now it looks like they've captured the moment after one unlucky lady was told to hit the road. 
According to Redditor lpmark04, who posted the image Thursday, the woman seen loading her belongings into a car is the ex-girlfriend of a pal who'd kicked her out after they broke up. Take a look at the pic below: 

But is this really the aftermath of a breakup? As many Redditors have noted in the comments, the alleged dumpee might just be cleaning out her car -- the foldable chairs and floor mats tossed out make that theory entirely feasible in our eyes.

You can embrace that change and make the best of it, or you can let the sting linger forever. And ""sting"" might be a generous word when we're talking about divorce recovery.",2013-04-24,FAMILY,"Awhile back, I wrote about the gifts of divorce.
It was really refreshing to see so many people respond in kind... from ""thank you for two wonderful kids"" to ""I'm not there yet, but hope to be able to thank you one day for our marriage."" I think the responses would have been very different 20 years ago. I like the trend toward The Good Divorce being Plan A, and the litigated, vindictive divorce being relegated farther back to the alphabet, like Plan Z more than Plan B.
It got me thinking about the silver linings of divorce. 
My then-husband said to me, ""You're not the woman I married!"" My response: ""That's right. The woman you married would not have put up with &$#**&# from a jerk like you.""
He was right. I'd lost myself. The woman he'd married was independent, energetic and interesting. The woman he was divorcing was depressed and worn out.
While I wouldn't wish a divorce on anyone, when bad things happen you can choose how you react and how much lasting impact the bad thing has on your life. When major life events happen, good or bad, we're changed forever. You can embrace that change and make the best of it, or you can let the sting linger forever. And ""sting"" might be a generous word when we're talking about divorce recovery.
What did you do to recover from your divorce? What good things came of it? How long did it take? Talking about divorce recovery is a gift we pay forward to those who are facing divorce, feeling scared and isolated. So please share your thoughts.
When I got divorced in 1996, it took me awhile to recover. Our marriage had been failing for awhile. But as it really hit the skids, I retreated. I resigned from the volunteer boards and activities I loved. I pared my schedule down to just my day job (ironically, as a divorce lawyer) and trying to take care of myself. 
After my husband moved out it felt pretty weird. Quiet. I turned the TV on without any sound so I wouldn't feel so alone. I don't remember much else about this time, and I don't think I want to remember. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. It was empty.
What I do remember is emerging from the divorce fog. First I cleaned up the house. I donated and gave stuff away. I was broke, so I redecorated with home sewing projects and paint. I moved the treadmill into the family room so I could watch TV while I worked out. Who cares? I'm living there by myself. I can have a gigantic piece of exercise equipment in the middle of the best part of the house if I want to!
I looked into stuff I'd always been curious about. The local high school had an Adult Ad program, so I signed up for craft classes and learned flower arranging and stained glass (trust me, I was no artist!). I rallied a couple of newly single girlfriends for chicken wings and beer every Wednesday at the neighborhood bar.
That led to sponsoring a softball team. I figured that was an excellent way to meet men, even though I wasn't quite ready to date. The softball team led to joining a mountain biking group, which led to quitting smoking because it's very difficult to mountain bike and smoke at the same time. After that I tried ice skating.
I knew about a ghost hunting group in my neighborhood (I kid you not!), so I joined. The leaders, Ed and Lorraine Warren, became the parents I never had and the group members made friends quickly as we crept through haunted houses in the middle of the night.  Before I knew it, I was having fun again. 
The transformation took about a year from the time my husband moved out. It happened gradually, as gradually as my marriage had gone from great to over, now that I think of it. 
So where do you find your silver linings?

Is there something in the water that's causing this? Or has what was once considered a sad outcome -- especially for the children -- become so commonplace and mainstream today that when we hear about it, it just seems normal and no longer shocking as it used to be when a couple who you thought would be together forever, suddenly is getting divorced?
Citing ""Irreconcilable differences"" means that you are unable to live in harmony with one another because of the inability to compromise, making you incompatible. But that seems over used and almost too general for the staggering amount of divorces there are these days. I'm expecting to hear new terms for why people are splitting up like: ""Doesn't floss,"" or ""Doesn't like sushi as much as I do,"" or maybe even ""Snoring.""
I understand that the reasons behind why people decide to part ways is personal and different for everyone, and what goes on behind closed doors -- or should I say on reality shows today -- is truly between the two people who no longer want to stay together (and no one else's business really). But if more and more people are choosing to break up for reasons that more often than not don't seem terribly serious, and they aren't making much of an effort to find a way to work through their problems or differences, will it become too easy to walk out the door rather than stay together? And if that's the case, will marriage itself become an anomaly eventually? I wonder. 
I'm not saying that there aren't legitimate reasons why people choose to divorce, and even though I'm not a product of it myself, I fully understand that sometimes -- even if it causes the children temporary sadness -- it's best to end a marriage that isn't working, no matter how hard you may try to fix it. Some marriages are simply unsalvageable.
What I would like to hear more of though is that people are genuinely trying to stay together and finding ways to solve their problems as a couple -- the ""we"" they decided to become when they took their wedding vows. That,""for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health"" -- or whatever their vows were -- they stuck it out because it was worth it to ""love and cherish each other"" more than flossing, sushi, or crazy-making snoring. Marriage is worth saving, and I hope it doesn't become abnormal for people to stay together. If that's what ends up happening, then maybe there is something in the water.

It was the ""heard it before"" element of the Petraeus story that led HuffPost columnist Lisa Belkin to wonder, ""What is it about powerful men and sex?"" Why do relatively few powerful women get caught up in sex scandals? In a HuffPost blog, she wrote: 
Is sex so fundamentally different for each gender that men see it as exerting their influence, while women somehow succumb to it? Have we simply not reached the point where there are enough women in positions of power, a critical mass that will make cheating an equal opportunity perk of office -- men do this because they can, and women don't because they can't... yet?

It's that I don't find her remorse convincing.",2013-10-16,FAMILY,"In case you missed it, Rielle Hunter apologized yesterday for her affair with John Edwards.
""I behaved badly.""
As someone who blogs about infidelity, I know I should be overjoyed. Here's one of the nation's most infamous mistresses saying ""Infidelity is wrong."" You can't buy that kind of PR for the chump cause.
But forgive my cynicism. This mea culpa comes after another book deal. According to Hunter:
My publisher came up with the idea of me going through my book and annotating all of my regrets and mistakes. I liked that idea. I thought it was innovative and interesting, but of course the actual execution of that idea turned out to be excruciating. Owning your past mistakes is no day at the beach but I do believe it is an important endeavor to undertake.
I know it may be churlish of me, but I don't accept her apology.
I think I'm a minority judging by the comments commending her for her bravery. It's not that I don't believe people engaged in affairs cannot change, or deeply regret their behavior after some painful consequences. It's not that I don't think Other Women are beyond reach.
It's that I don't find her remorse convincing.
To most people, who've probably never been chumped, Hunter seems sincere. She says the right things. ""I behaved badly."" ""I was selfish."" ""I hurt people."" ""I hurt Elizabeth Edwards."" She comes across as contrite.
As someone who received several such apologies from a practiced liar and personality disordered cheater, however, I see some familiar cracks in the ""remorse.""
1. The subtle blame shift. Almost immediately after she says she ""behaved badly,"" she wants us to know that she was once ""viciously attacked"" by the media. She says she thought she was a victim. But then, curiously, she never disavows that thought. She says it doesn't ""matter."" I find those two statements contradictory -- the acknowledgement of misbehavior, but the dismissal of any substance to those ""attacks."" If you truly thought you were in the wrong, you wouldn't characterize people publicly calling you on your crap as a ""vicious attack.""
Heck, I thought she found the discourse on her ""regrets and mistakes"" to be ""innovative and interesting."" So long as it's her own publisher?
2. The subtle minimization. ""I behaved badly"" is the sort of statement reserved for spilled red wine on your friend's white sofa and not paying the dry cleaning bill. ""I behaved monstrously"" is a more apt description of sleeping with a married man whose wife is dying of cancer and then continuing to assassinate the woman's character during her last days on earth. I'm sorry, Rielle -- bad behavior and ""hurt"" just don't do it for me.
3. The vagueness. Hunter is rather short on particulars. I found this a telling attribute of my own cheating ex. He'd tearfully tell me how sorry he was, how it just killed him to think of what he had done. But when I questioned him carefully -- how are you sorry? What do you think of exactly that makes you feel regret? What triggers you? He couldn't answer me. It was all words and no substance. Hunter gives us a litany of those she ""hurt"" and doesn't tell us how she hurt them. Perhaps we have to read the book to learn more. Is this an apology tease?
4. I did it for Love. It's hard to fault people who love. Okay, she confesses it was selfish of her, but there's still the not-so-subtle narrative that these were forces beyond her control. Hey, she made the grievous mistake of loving too much. Poor sausage. 
5. The FOO (Family of Origin) excuse. ""I didn't realize how damaged I was."" Because I was unaware, hey, that book I wrote and got a nice advance for? It doesn't matter, because I didn't intend to hurt anyone. Blame it on my damage.
I am a product of infidelity. Both of my parents cheated on each other, and as a kid it damaged me. I then grew up, fell in love with a married man, and caused even more damage. I believe history often repeats itself if you do not take responsibility and change it. Infidelity is wrong. It hurts people. It hurt me and then I in turn also hurt people. It is a chain of pain. One I do not wish to pass on to my own daughter.
An explanation is just that. It's not an an act of contrition. Returning the money? Quietly shuffling away and exiting stage left? Those are acts of contrition. 
6. It wasn't my Intention. This is a classic ingredient of faux remorse -- ""I didn't intend to hurt you."" It's copping to a lesser crime (with a little blameshifting twist, implied ""but if you find it upsetting, well that's on you."")
It Wasn't My Intention is total nonsense, because affairs are completely premeditated. To live a double life requires more planning than an NATO air strike. In Hunter's case, they were bribing a guy to pose as her baby's father. Sounds pretty intentional to me.
I am sincerely sorry for my bad behavior, and for hurting anyone. If I hurt you, I am sorry. It was not my intention, I was thoughtless and selfish, and I am sorry.
Hurting anyone? Haven't we just diluted the apology exponentially by lumping Elizabeth Edwards and her children with me and the masses? Yes Rielle, thank you. I was offended by your creepy photo spread of you splay legged, naked from the waist down, surrounded by stuffed animals. You can't unsee that.
7. The lack of humility. When British politician John Profumo was scandalized by an affair in 1963, he dropped out of political life and quietly devoted the rest of his life to charitable causes outside the limelight. He demonstrated true humility, without the self congratulations of a book deal.
That Rielle Hunter thinks the world is eager for her apology and wants us to pay folding money for it, is all I need to know about the depths of her character transformation.

Goldstein's take? All dating profiles are rife with potential red flags, so this 40-something shouldn't be too concerned that her longstanding single status will be an issue for others.

Ensure we have enough real estate so everyone has space that is exclusively their own. Always earn enough to support myself and my kids by myself. Believe that my career and income are just as important to his -- even if I earn less. Laugh about his annoying habits. Laugh at my habits he finds annoying. Accept that his shortcomings -- small or large -- do not reflect on me. (Unless those shortcomings are really bad.) Fight fair and fast. Let stuff go. Make sex a priority. No matter what. No intentionally farting in front of each other. Or using the bathroom with the door open. I won't expect him to change. I'll compromise more. And listen more. Let him have his way more.

What can we learn from the best teaching and learning practices of mathematics around the world? Who was the first woman to run for President of the United States and why is her story still relevant today? While more and more young people achieve higher education degrees, youth unemployment continues to rise - so what are we going to do about it? There is a new House of Books in Kabul created by an inspiring young Afghan woman. What would change if Diane Ravitch or Charles Fadel were Secretary of Education for the new US administration? And how do we better engender a healthy, happy, and productive school environment where both teachers and students can flourish? Those were the questions that most intrigued us this month.
It's been long understood that literacy is the foundation from which cultural revolutions are born, and the opening of Sajia Darwish's library is the first step in a multidimensional approach to support a reading culture in her Kabul community. Currently, between 200 and 350 students visit the new library on a daily basis to read, do school work, or to take out or return a book. In her inspiring interview with The Global Search for Education this month, Sajia defies traditional gender roles and offers a tangible sense of hope for change in even the most tragic circumstances.
In an aria from the new opera, Mrs. President, Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for President of the United States, sings, ""I'm told I'm a citizen by right of birth. We pay taxes. We obey the same laws. We supply you with citizens. We give them up for war. Yet we're poor, powerless, the property of men."" ""I am struck by the similar epithets that are hurled at Hillary Clinton to those that Woodhull was branded with,"" says the opera's world renowned composer and conductor, Victoria Bond. ""She was reviled and called ""Mrs. Satan."" ""They wanted to have her jailed and accused her of being dishonest and a threat to decent society,"" adds Bond, who believes her opera is the story about ""the power of one person to bring about awareness and eventual change.""
Youth unemployment continues to grow. An increasing number of people around the world have higher education degrees. Despite this, more than half of the workers are employed in jobs for which their levels of education and skills are inappropriate. There is a skills mismatch in the world labor market. The Millennial Bloggers are based all over the world. They are innovators in entrepreneurship, journalism, education, entertainment, and academic scholarship. This month, we asked them to share their perspectives on jobs, employment and the role of education. ""As globalization brings us closer together, schools need to better prepare students to live in a world that demands failure in exchange for the keys to success,"" says Jacob Deleon Navarrete. Given the huge loans many Millennials are faced with repaying plus the grim employment prospects, ""is now the time to revisit what we define as success?"" writes Harmony Siganporia. Up and coming entrepreneur Isadora Baum advocates for embracing failure, and building solid relationships and life-long learning, while Broadway producer James Kernochan recommends that patrons behind the arts ""place emphasis on and resources behind programs that give artists structure and a meaningful social milieu when they are done with school.""
Let's talk about mathematics. The Man from PISA, Andreas Schleicher, is on a mission to share best teaching and learning practices from around the world. In 2012, PISA studied students' performance in mathematics, and additionally, collected data from students and school principals in 70 countries about how teachers teach mathematics. The goal was to explore what teaching and learning strategies related to higher student achievement by way of answering 10 key questions. My interview with Andreas reveals all the important answers.
Our popular 2016 Education Debate series, with the big picture questions in US Education posed to thought leaders at the forefront of educational change, ended up being published by media outlets all over the world. Andy Hargreaves, Howard Gardner, Randi Weingarten, Julia Freeland Fisher, Diane Ravitch and Charles Fadel were asked to imagine what would change if they were Secretary of Education for the new administration. This month, we published the last two interviews with Ravitch and Fadel. Ravitch takes aim at standardized testing and the failure of policy makers to recognize the effect that poverty has on a child's opportunity for success. ""Poverty is highly correlated with poor educational outcomes - with test scores, absenteeism, dropout rates, and every other measure of attainment and achievement."" Further, she decries the blaming of teachers, the closing of public schools, and the founding of charters as answers to our current problems. Fadel is focused on updating ""What"" students need to learn for today's world. He argues that ""contemporary education is failing our students because we are stuck in a curriculum designed for a different century, i.e. a curriculum that focuses heavily on quantity of testable knowledge. Yet if designed well, curriculum can help lead to more peaceful, sustainable societies, with more economic progress and fairness, composed of people who are fulfilled and happier.""
What makes a school happy and healthy? Our Global Teacher Bloggers are pioneers and innovators in fields such as technology integration, mathematics coaching, special needs education, science instruction, and gender equity. These teachers empower and enrich the lives of young people from nearly every background imaginable. They shared their answers to our question: How do we better engender a healthy, happy, and productive school environment where both teachers and students can flourish? ""Feeling you belong, you're appreciated, you're supported and you're important sounds like a good place to start,"" writes Richard Wells in New Zealand. Maarit Rossi in Finland believes the important ingredients include ""healthy school lunches, enough breaks for students during the day and good working conditions."" Miriam Mason-Sesay in Sierra Leone believes that all constituents of the school community should ""have the right, but also the responsibility, to make their voices heard""; and Vicki Davis writes about the key principles that she believes can improve the well-being of any school community, including choosing to improve, playing to people's strengths and being willing to serve and love those we have to work with.
Our thanks once again to all our amazing teachers, millennials, contributors and supporters around the world.

271,EDUCATION,Globalization of Knowledge via the Internet,"Sriya Chakravarti, ContributorProfessor, Thinker, Globe Trotter",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/globalization-of-knowledg_b_6255162.html,We have come far in our quest for education. The journey of knowledge and exploration is quite fascinating and deeply speaks about the interconnectedness and the interdependence of the world.,2014-12-02,EDUCATION,"We have come far in our quest for education. The journey of knowledge and exploration is quite fascinating and deeply speaks about the interconnectedness and the interdependence of the world.
As human beings discovered things and experienced life as it happened, they felt a need to record the outcomes so that the information could be passed on from one generation to the other. This would not only save time but also effort on part of the upcoming generations, so that they could focus their energy on other important matters. Thus, came the drawing and writing on cave walls. The History of Education Timeline states ""it is possible that the cavemen had schools for their children but it is highly unlikely."" Through the discovery of papyrus the information in the caves was later transferred on rolls. Then these scrolls were probably stored in the great library of Alexandria, until it was destroyed by fire. Similarly, other forms of written instruments were used to document knowledge nuggets around the world.
Historical evidence suggests Iraq, India and China had formal schooling systems way before the United States was discovered. In India the organized schooling system was called the ""Gurukul"" system of education, and the first ever university was established at Nalanda in the year 5 CE. This was a first residential university that attracted scholars and students from faraway lands like Tibet, China, Korea etc. In addition, it had the capacity to serve 10,000 students with 2000 teachers. This information validates that people from the beginning of time have recognized that knowledge is important for sustenance and humanity needs to be interconnected and interdependent to achieve the same.
Ideas were conceived, thought about and discussed in many countries of the world, especially Greece where teachers like Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and their students sat in open air space to contemplate topics and record discussions. The Socratic method of teaching is still used by academics around the world and many schools are highly influenced by Plato's thoughts on education and classification of society. On the other hand, Aristotle's idea about the practical approach to education still holds true and is a major requirement of our generation.
After the birth of the printing press somewhere in the year 1041, the pursuit for knowledge picked up momentum. Later on with major universities like Harvard and similar being setup, the Industrial Revolution, hunger for knowledge kept growing. People from around the world decided to study at such esteemed institutions and as a result many great thinkers were raised during this time, whose ideas and philosophies are still in practice in this modern day and age. 
Blackboards, portable slates, fountain pens, pencils, paper, standardized testing all followed one after the other. A major break through in knowledge exploration happened with the advent of the Internet and the invention of personal computers, I Pads, I Pods, and I Phones. Seeking knowledge became easier, faster and portable than ever before.
The technological revolution brought entire humanity closer than one can imagine. Dissemination of knowledge became quicker, and cheaper. Books went online, and so did the universities with MOOCS (Massive Open Online Courses). Google became a universal tool for finding information fast. It can be comfortably said that anyone with Internet access is empowered today. Students are no longer dependent on their teachers, family members or the society alone to answer their curiosity. They have access to a whole domain of information on the World Wide Web: Khan Academy is an example of the same.
In the olden days, books were transported back and forth or stored in libraries to communicate ideas of great thinkers but now with the Internet, information is dispensed in a millisecond from the comfort of one's home. Similarly, languages were hard to decipher but today people from around the world can simply log on and learn any language basics without spending much money. With the help of Google translator they can also convert their thoughts into a variety of languages. Even though, the translator is not hundred percent accurate, it still conveys the essentials of a given thought.
A lecture given by Indian spiritual guru like Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in Surat can be downlinked in real-time in San Francisco. Uploading pictures instantaneously via camera phones on to our Facebook profiles for our friends and relatives in faraway land and having immediate feedback makes us feel connected truly and completely. Learning how to cook different cuisines using Youtube and without visiting other countries or consulting cookbooks is yet another example of how the Internet has radically transformed our lives. 
In academe, teaching a group of students that are placed in different time zones through a virtual class session is another case of interconnectedness that the Internet has brought in our lives. Looking for jobs never got easier. Even though, job markets are rough, if we have a decent Internet connection we always win. We can apply for jobs based on our preferred region of work. Sometimes, we may even stumble upon opportunities that we are unaware of. Linked In is yet another powerful tool in lives of working professionals today. Back in the day, our ancestors did not have this privilege.
Our lives have gone digital. Everything we do these days is mostly an online affair. We read news, check our e-mails, edit and post pictures, watch videos, and use Internet applications like Twitter, Instagram, Whatsapp and Skype to connect with our near and dear ones on a daily basis. Our favorite shows, movies, books, quotes can all be found online. We can get hours of self-help therapy, fashion and fitness tips, friends and support groups, long lost relatives and in some cases, we can even locate the history of our ancestors to bring much meaning in our life. The interesting fact about all of this is that most applications on the Internet are free or charge a nominal price.
The Internet has not only connected us, and shown us that it is the thread that binds us into interdependence and interconnectedness, but it is also our flag of hope. It helps us to identify that we are not alone. As long as we have the Internet, we are winners. However, this power of the Internet needs to be used with great caution. If not, it can wreak havoc.

But there is one huge honking squealing flashing siren wrapped in a fluorescent red flag atop a high-powered blinking crimson light.",2015-04-18,EDUCATION,"So now it has officially begun, again. Hillary Rodham Clinton is running for President. Let the questions begin. But the questions I'm interested in are not the stupid ones (was she behind a Nazi commie plot to blow up Benghazi?) or the horse racey ones (will Hillary become inauthentic in a more authentic way?). Clinton, for a variety of reasons, receives a lot of stupid animosity for a lot of stupid reasons, and there are chapters of her career that could stand to see a little sunlight. I am not interested in any of that.
My question is, will she be good for public education?
I think we can all agree at this point that it's no longer possible to assume that anybody running under the Democrat standard is a supporter of public schools. Andrew Cuomo and the Obama administration have painfully proven that sad current reality. So it would be useful to know what kind of Democrat Clinton II proposes to be.
There's not much of a record to search through. Clinton's track record hasn't brought her into education issues very often. But there is one huge honking squealing flashing siren wrapped in a fluorescent red flag atop a high-powered blinking crimson light.
It's the Center for American Progress.
CAP bills itself as a progressive thinky tank, but it could also be called a holding tank for Clintonian administration members-in-waiting. Among the folks already attached to the HRC are John Podesta, who rose through a career of political aiding to become Chief of Staff for the second Clinton term. After that he formed CAP and has run it since. Podesta protege Jennifer Palmieri has also bounced between government jobs and CAP. They are both major players in the HRC campaign.
CAP has hosted many folks related to the campaign, including Clinton herself. In fact, if you start looking through Clinton's various appearances intended to help stave off controversy, they often turn out to be at CAP. When close Clinton advisor Huma Abedin came under fire, CAP CEO Neera Tanden was one of her staunch defenders.
CAP does an excellent job of hoovering up contributions from wealthy money-wielding folks, and it's a measure of CAP's closeness to Clinton that this money shoveling is seen in some quarters as a means of getting access to what may be the next DC administration.
All in all, it does not seem like a huge leap to think that CAP's positions on education could hew closely to the Clinton II positions. And that takes us back to the sirens and flags and blinkers.
I've looked at some CAP output in the past. Here's some of what we've turned up.
CAP offered a ""paper"" (because that's what thinky tanks do) providing a roadmap to implementing Common Core. The paper pushes high stakes testing, test-based accountability, computer-based testing, aligned curriculum, VAM, and the fantasy that the new tests will be test-prep free. 
When Senator Alexander floated his first ESEA rewrite, CAP was there to call it a failure, primarily because it didn't love high stakes testing enough. Minorities and students with disabilities need the opportunity to take many tests, because that's how they'll achieve more. Also, parents need the feedback in order to know what the kids are doing, and also to make selections from the various school choices available. Any bad idea you've ever hated in the Obama/Duncan administration, CAP has been praising right along.
CAP is not above floating new talking points with a whacky disregard for reality, including a bizarre article that tried to argue that CCSS really helps the female girls, even though the data it cited doesn't support the claims they made. CAP also occasionally turns to TNTP for research back-up, which is like hiring Daffy Duck to work on your dignity and etiquette practice for the Royal Ball.
And CAP was sloppy enough to illustrate an article about how teachers now stick around for more years by slapping up a picture of a TFA teacher who quit after two years to get a corporate job. Fun fact: after being called on it by bloggers near and far, they've left the picture on the article. 
In short, there is no reason yet to think that Clinton would change a single, solitary piece of Obama/Duncan education policy (and that was no significant change from Bush policy). Heck, maybe she could just keep Arne around for another four years. He already knows where the office is, already has furniture he likes.
If Hillary wants my support (and while I may be representative of nobody but myself, maybe there are a few other teachers who are kind of tired of the current administration ed policies-- just two or three of us), then she had better explain exactly what she's going to do differently. I could also say we'd like to know who we're going to get for USED secretary, but hey, we thought we knew last time that we were getting Linda Darling-Hammond and look how that turned out.
But I can tell you this: I have never been a single-issue voter, but my profession has never been so attacked, besieged and crushed under policymakers' boots. So I will not, not under any circumstances, vote for any candidate who gives me the slightest inkling that she (or he) is planning to give me four more years like the last fifteen. I don't care if you're promising me a pony and your opponent is threatening to send locusts to my home town-- if you aren't going to change the destructive, educationally abusive, mandatory malpractice policies of the previous two administrations, I will not vote for you, period, full stop.
That is what I'm ready for.

273,EDUCATION,Hungry on Campus,"Harold O. Levy, ContributorExecutive Director, Jack Kent Cooke Foundation",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hungry-on-campus_us_5a3931e3e4b0c65287ac8034,We need to do much more to facilitate these struggling students’ success.,2017-12-19,EDUCATION,"When the federal government created the National School Lunch Program in 1946, it was viewed at the time as a national security initiative. Undernourished students, after all, would likely not be fit enough to serve in the armed forces. But it was also described more broadly as strengthening the nation as a whole. 
“We have the technical knowledge to provide plenty of good food for every man, woman and child in this country,” President Harry Truman said when he signed the act into law. “Despite our capacity to produce food, we have often failed to distribute it as well as we should.” 
The program, Truman said, was a step forward in correcting this national failure. In the decades since, progress has been made in ensuring our students no longer go hungry, but there is still much work to be done. Student hunger does not end at high school graduation. Food insecurity is plaguing our college campuses, with thousands of students each year skipping meals, going to bed hungry and suffering in class. 
It’s a crisis that warrants federal intervention at a level similar to the National School Lunch Program. Yet, little is being done to address the issue. 
A recent Brookings Institution study found that food insecurity among households with students in four-year colleges in 2015 was 11.2 percent. Households with students who enrolled in two-year colleges were more likely to be food insecure, with average rates of food insecurity of 21.2 percent during 2008-14. A 2015 study at California State University estimated that food insecurity affected an alarming 21 percent of students. Feeding America, a national nonprofit network of food banks, estimates that nearly half of the college students who use its pantries each year must choose between paying for educational expenses and food. 
According to the University of Wisconsin HOPE Lab, undergraduate students are at greater risk for food insecurity than the general population. Earlier this year, researchers at the lab surveyed 33,000 community college students across the country. They discovered that one-third of those students are going hungry. 
The concept of the starving college student is too easily dismissed, thanks to long-standing caricatures of campus life. All college students eat ramen noodles, so what’s the big deal? True hunger and food insecurity is no joke, however. As Brookings noted, food insecurity among college students is “associated with poorer health, poor academic performance, and mental health symptoms such as depression and anxiety.” 
Colleges are trying to help. Amherst College, for example, has gone so far as to open a year-round dorm so that housing- and food-insecure students have a place to stay and get food during times when the normal dorms are closed. Last year, California passed legislation that requires its public colleges to apply to participate in local food assistance programs. It also established funding for college food pantries as part of the state’s Emergency Food Assistance Program. 
Many institutions have opened up such food pantries in recent years. Nearly 400 schools are now part of the College and University Food Bank Alliance. Four years ago, the organization had just 15 members. One member, George Washington University, opened its food bank last year. Within a month, more than 250 students were using the pantry each day. 
Colleges have had to step up, not only to address the immense needs of their students, but because little help is coming from anywhere else. As a country, we are ignoring the problem. The systems currently in place for keeping Americans from starving do not translate well to college campuses. While a growing number of college students are enrolled in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the vast majority cannot use those benefits on campus. 
As of 2016, just two college campuses were known to have cleared the many hurdles that prevent colleges from participating the program. 
At a minimum, the federal government should require the states to track graduation rates for food insecure students. Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor at Temple University and a leading expert on student hunger, has proposed extending the National School Lunch Program from schoolchildren to college students, and extending subsidized housing and transportation to college students. But this is hardly enough. 
Many food insecure students are also homeless. The University of Wisconsin study found that 14 percent of community college students are currently experienced homelessness. They require counseling, shelter, and often clothing subsidies and emergency funds. 
We need to do much more to facilitate these struggling students’ success.

274,EDUCATION,Restore the True Spirit of ESEA,"Diann Woodard, ContributorPresident, American Federation of School Administrators",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/restore-the-true-spirit-of-esea_b_6795256.html,Congress has the opportunity to invest in our nation's most valuable resource -- our youth. We need to write to our legislators to remind them of the original intent of ESEA and the need to ensure that our students get a world-class education that allows them to become contributing members of society.,2015-03-04,EDUCATION,"The single most important issue facing the 114th Congress is the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), a law whose primary purpose when it was originally passed was to alleviate the conditions of poverty that often cripple the ability of educators to meet our professional commitments and crush the hopes of the children we serve.
At its recent AFL-CIO Executive Council meeting, a statement titled Restore the Promise of ESEA was introduced and passed asking Congress to reclaim the true spirit of ESEA -- a law signed by then President Lyndon Baines Johnson as a way to alleviate poverty by providing adequate resources to disadvantaged and special needs children, thereby helping them to better compete.
The AFL CIO statement further calls on Congress to invest in the things frontline educators know our students need to secure a high quality education, rather than perpetuating the mandates and evaluation schemes promoted under No Child Left Behind (NCLB) that have so patently failed.
Indeed recalling the intent of ESEA only highlights the flaws in the first draft of the legislation, Student Success Act, soon to be debated in the House of Representatives. The draft continues to weigh heavily on testing and keeping funding at sequestration levels, making it difficult, if not impossible, to provide services and resources in areas where child poverty is at an all-time high.
In fact, a report released recently by the White House found that the bill would cap spending for the next six years at $800 million lower than it was in 2012. 
During the public response phase of HR 5, my union, the American Federation of School Administrators (AFSA), made suggestions of ways to improve the act. In coalition with the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) and the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP), we submitted recommendations calling for inclusion of school leaders in the development of evaluation plans and more professional development and training. In addition, our coalition challenged performance assessments currently in use. 
A joint statement we submitted to Congress noted that ""assessments that are attached to high-stakes and a punitive label regardless of whether or not a student is actually making academic gains and growth is counterproductive. This has led to an untenable environment of over-testing, and [has] forced educators to spend less time on instruction in order to prepare for standardized tests.""
To address these inequities, we urged that states and districts use more expansive growth models instead of high-stakes assessments in the belief that such an expansion of assessment systems would put more balance, fairness, and accuracy in measuring student and school progress and performance. The AFL CIO's Executive Council statement strongly endorsed this approach by, among other things, calling for an end to the federal mandate on teacher and principal evaluations.
Dr. Christine Handy, principal at Gaithersburg High School in Gaithersburg, Maryland, made a more viable path to success apparent in her testimony before the Senate Health Education Labor Pension (HELP) Committee when she stated, ""ESEA must acknowledge the vital role of principals and provide them with appropriate professional support to ensure high academic achievement for all students.""
Congress has the opportunity to invest in our nation's most valuable resource -- our youth. We need to write to our legislators to remind them of the original intent of ESEA and the need to ensure that our students get a world-class education that allows them to become contributing members of society.

275,EDUCATION,Schools Should Be Safe For All,"Michelle Pitot, ContributorChief of Staff, YWCA Southern Arizona",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/schools-should-be-safe-for-all_us_5952cc2be4b0f078efd985ab,Eight states actually have laws that restrict teachers from talking about LGBT issues at all.,2017-06-27,EDUCATION,"We’re at the end of Pride Month, and across the country Pride parades have been taking place in cities large and small. Yet although it’s been almost 50 years since the Stonewall Riots started the mainstream LGBT rights movement, the parades this year have shown the strain of renewed battles under the current administration. In Los Angeles, the parade committee decided to call it a “Resist March” rather than a pride parade, and San Francisco’s historically celebratory march this year included a “resistance contingent.”
It seems hard to believe that just two years ago the White House was decked out in rainbow colors to celebrate the Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide. Today, we’re living with the most regressive political leadership regarding civil rights that we’ve had in decades. As a therapist and educator who has for years championed the rights of LGBT youth, I’m struggling to stay hopeful.
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, with her abject refusal to take a stand on the maintenance of LGBT protections in the public school setting, is not making it any easier. While she has stated in a general way that she doesn’t support discrimination, last month DeVos also refused to uphold denying federal funds to public schools that deny rights to LGBT students, or even those with LGBT parents. Consider what this means, when schools are one of the most powerful socializing forces of our youth.
A few months ago, I got a call from a parent wanting me to see her teenaged daughter for therapy, saying her previously happy, healthy, athletic daughter was becoming increasingly withdrawn, and failing in school for the first time ever. After a few sessions, the girl revealed to me that she had realized she was a lesbian and was terrified that anyone in her family or school would find out. She wasn’t even sure that life as a lesbian was worth living.
“Read the news? People get to refuse service to people like me just because of who I am. At school kids say ‘fag’ and ‘dyke’ all the time and no one says anything. Why should I believe it’s going to get any better?”
Some will say that we’ve seen great progress towards LGBT visibility and acceptance in the last few decades, and on some levels that’s true. Twenty years ago, Ellen DeGeneres came out as a lesbian personally and on her television show, with painful repercussions for her as well as others who appeared on her show. Since then, we’ve seen gay characters in mainstream shows and movies; many states and then the federal government legalized gay marriage; the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” law was repealed; and LGBT individuals and couples gained adoption and parenting rights.
But during that same time frame, what has changed in our schools?
Twenty years ago, I completed my dissertation, which examined how LGB youth were not served well by their school community. My research showed that despite a dropout rate that exceeded every other minority population, schools did nothing to keep gay and lesbian kids in the schools, and lack of support could actually be seen as contributing to the high dropout rate among this group. One young lesbian in my study, an honors student throughout 11 years until she dropped out her senior year, said to me, “I have seen my school bend over backwards to keep violent gang members on this campus, but when I started getting harassed, they didn’t lift a finger to keep me here.”
And now?
With the help of the media, society now has more visibility of LGBT lives, and young people can recognize homosexuality much more easily. But this visibility can have a detrimental effect, since schools haven’t put serious protections into place to stop harassment. Eight states actually have laws that restrict teachers from talking about LGBT issues at all. With DeVos in charge, LGBT students have no reason to believe their rights will be protected. Is it any wonder then that the CDC reports that LGB youth are still today more than four times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual peers, with one in six seriously considering it in the last year? LGBT teachers often feel only marginally safer as adults in the school setting, but their jobs are still not safeguarded by Federal legislation that protects many groups from workplace discrimination.
When it comes to making a difference, maybe the federal level feels out of reach, but that’s no excuse for inaction. We need to hold educators more accountable to the communities they create for our children. Parents and all taxpayers need to speak up and start asking questions. How does the school handle bullying? What training is in place to help teachers learn how to address this issue? What is included in the curriculum that helps kids to understand the ongoing public battles over LGBT rights? Where are the safe spaces on campus?
This is not an issue that affects only the LGBT community. As long as a boy is afraid to be sensitive for fear of being called “faggot,” and a girl doesn’t want to risk being called a “dyke” if she’s too strong or athletic, not only are the young affected, but we are all held within homophobic constraints of personal expression. As long as all kids can’t be who they are, and LGBT teachers cannot freely be seen as positive role models, schools perpetuate the status quo of intolerance.

276,EDUCATION,What Trump World Schools Look Like,"Alan Singer, ContributorSocial studies educator, Hofstra University, my opinions, of c...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-trump-world-schools-look-like_us_59b660aee4b0bef3378ce1d5,Donald Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos champion the privatization of public education in the United States. They,2017-09-11,EDUCATION,"Donald Trump and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos champion the privatization of public education in the United States. They support rightwing attacks on public schools as “government schools,” as if something was inherently wrong with public education programs.
Trump and DeVos hold virtual religious certainty that businessmen, bankers and hedge fund financiers ― the people they praise as “entrepreneurs” ― will provide a better education for American children than teachers and public schools. The proposed Trump/DeVos education budget redirects more than $1 billion from public education to school voucher plans that subsidize private, charter, and religious schools.
For those of us who do not share their certainty, Trump World schools offer a frightening future. Twenty percent of new businesses fail in the first year of operation. About half do not survive five years. Only a third celebrate a 10th anniversary. This may not be a problem for the fast food industry and corner grocery stores, but it will be a disaster with millions of displaced young children if schools become start-up businesses.
DeVos, a Michigan billionaire with ties to the Amway fortune, dismisses public schools as a “dead end.” She bankrolled a private school voucher measure in Michigan, spent millions to elect state legislators committed to cutting public school budgets, and promoting for-profit charter schools. She and her children all attended religious academies rather than public schools. In a 2001 interview with her husband, DeVos explained, “Our desire is to confront the culture in ways that will continue to advance God’s kingdom.”
Unfortunately, we already know what Trump World schools look like. “Entrepreneurs,” charter gurus with political connections, and religious promoters are already operating “schools” with government and business support. This is what Trump World schools look like in the United States and other parts of the globe.
Entrepreneurial Fraud in Liberia
Third World countries like Liberia in West Africa are desperate to improve educational opportunities for their young people and are very short on cash. They provide fertile ground for for-profit edu-entrepreneurs and for business schemes that will be transferred to the United States if Trump and DeVos get their way.
Liberia acknowledges that the access and quality of its education system lags behind most if the world. Only 38 percent of its children attend primary or elementary school. Only 25 percent of its adult women read on a functional level. Out of desperation, it turned over management of 93 public schools to eight private contractors who promised to deliver better education at the same cost. The teachers in these schools were supposed to remain government employees with equivalent salaries and benefits, the schools would continue to be owned by the government, and the contracting companies agreed to provide free education open to all. While the government only allocates $50 a year per pupil in its traditional public schools (this is hard to believe and I wonder if it is accurate), Liberia agreed to provide an additional $50 per student to the contracting schools during the experiment.
After a year, an independent review found that students in the contracting schools did perform better on standardized tests than did students in traditional public schools. But it also found that to justify turning the entire Liberian school system over to private for-profit companies, the contracting companies cheated. One company, Bridge International Academies, with financial support from the Gates Foundation and mega-corporations like Pearson Education, spent over a thousand dollars per student as an investment in its own future profits. This allowed them to hire additional teachers, lower class size, and skew results. Bridge also “improved” test results by throwing thousands of children out of their schools, discharging three-quarters of the original teachers, teachers who still had to be paid at government expense, insisting on additional technology, and bringing in their own scripted learning programs that the government would have to pay for in the future.
One town, Kollita Wolah, was outraged when Bridge took over a school built by the townspeople, and immediately decided to reduce the number of children attending the town’s school from 75 to 45. They told parents their children could attend government schools in the nearby city of Gbarnga. But it meant either a 30-minute walk along a busy commercial road or transportation fees parents could not afford to pay. In the end, many parents were forced to pull their children out of school.
The review concluded that the contracting companies failed to demonstrate their their entrepreneurial approach would work in normal Liberian schools receiving standard funding. Bridge entrepreneurs sounds just like an American charter school company. What a model for the United States to emulate!
Religious Schools in Brooklyn
Brooklyn, New York’s ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities are block voters, trading political support for public dollars and the right to operate unregulated religious “schools.” Their own children become victims of miseducation in these schools and official educational neglect. Almost 60,000 children and adolescents attend ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools, known as yeshivas, in New York City. Trump and DeVos want to provide federal vouchers to pay to support these religious schools.
Dozens of these religious schools in Brooklyn fail to meet the state legal mandate that they offer students an education “at least substantially equivalent” to public schools. Local activists from Young Advocates for Fair Education, some of whom were once students in these schools, accuse public officials of willfully and illegally ignoring what is happening in these schools for fear of alienating voters. According to Naftuli Moster, the executive director of the group, children attending these schools, but especially boys who are expected to lead deeply religious lives, complete their “education” with poor to nonexistent English and math skills. Chaim Levin, a graduate of Educational Institute Oholei Torah in Crown Heights reported, “I attended school Sunday through Friday, every day all day, and I did not learn how to read or write in the English language. I was not taught history, science, or geography, and I learned no math skills. The only thing we studied was texts from the Old Testament and the Talmud.”
Young Advocates for Fair Education found that some of these yeshivas already receive millions of dollars in public funds. If these were Islamic religious schools, there would be national outcry with Donald Trump leading the protests.
Charter and Religious Schools in Michigan
Michigan is Betsy DeVos’ home state and the place where she has done the greatest damage to public education promoting charter and religious schools. An independent review by the Brookings Institution ranked Michigan last among all states in improving student “proficiency.” Another study, a 2016 analysis by the Education Trust-Midwest, found 70 percent of Michigan charter schools in the bottom half of the state’s school rankings. The study concluded that as a result of “charterization,” Michigan had declined from being an average performing state on math and reading tests to one of the worst, in just 10 years.
The Potter’s House Christian school, with campuses in Grand Rapids and Wyoming, Michigan, are a pet project of DeVos and her husband Dick. Between 2001 and 2013 the DeVos foundation donated over $2 million to the school. Besides being a donor, Betsy is a school volunteer and a member of Potter’s advisory board. In speeches and interviews she praises the school, with 540 students in grades pre-K through 12, for giving “kids the chance to succeed and thrive.” DeVos claims her involvement there inspired her to advocate for education-related causes.
But Potter’s House is not just any school. According to its website, it is a “Christ-centered school, birthed in prayer and rooted in Scripture” that equips its students to serve God and society” by challenging them and their families “ to grow in their personal relationship with Jesus Christ.”
Every employee, and I assume every volunteer including DeVos, must sign a pledge to endorse its religious philosophy before working in the school. The pledge includes affirming that “the Bible, God’s Word, is infallible,” “The major goal of education is to bring each child into his or her full potential in conformance with the image of God,” “the world was perfect at creation, but sin intervened, severing all people’s perfect relationship with God,” and that God “requires that individuals and social groups follow in obedience to His word.”
The Christian evangelical movement has an irrational side that opposes science and reason and does not belong in public supported schools. Answers in Genesis is an “apologetics ministry, dedicated to helping Christians defend their faith and proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ effectively.” Its focus is on “providing answers to questions about the Bible—particularly the book of Genesis—regarding key issues such as creation, evolution, science, and the age of the earth.” According to Answers in Genesis, “The Bible” is the “history book of the universe” that “provides a reliable, eye-witness account of the beginning of all things, and can be trusted to tell the truth in all areas it touches on.”
Their website has a long defense of creationism and its place in education. They argue “Creation was by the direct action of the Creator as opposed to some naturalistic process. Creation took place in the beginning and was finished and complete. Creation was not spread out over a major portion of the supposed evolutionary vast time history of the universe. Creation was by the word of the Creator ... Ultimately, the controversy about the age of the earth is a controversy about the authority of Scripture. If millions of years really happened, then the Bible is false and cannot speak with authority on any issue, even the Gospel.”
If Trump and DeVos have their way religious mysticism will replace science in many schools and a new generation of climate change skeptics will have to confront God’s wrath in the next wave of once-in-500-years hurricanes that seem to occur on a weekly basis. Covefefe!

I Admire Teachers' Unions!","Diane Ravitch, Guest WriterGuest Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yes-it-is-true-i-dont-like-school-choice-i-admire-teachers-unions_us_59de9bc0e4b0eb18af061126,Public schools are part of the promise of America.,2017-10-11,EDUCATION,"One of the most annoying aspects of the privatization movement is that they pretend to be progressives. They are not. They are reactionaries, and they have the history to prove it.
They stole the word “Reform,” so they could pretend they wanted to make schools better instead of admitting that they want to replace public schools with religious schools, private schools, for-profit schools, online schools, anything but public schools. Hint: Destruction is not reform.
Take Jeanne Allen, the CEO of the misnamed Center for Education Reform. Jeanne worked for the far-right Heritage Foundation before she launched CER many years ago. She wants School Choice. She is indistinguishable from Betsy DeVos. She loves charter schools, vouchers, anything but public schools. She pretends that School Choice is a progressive cause. No, it is not.
She recently wrote an article criticizing some of us who support public schools (like nearly 90 percent of all families). She criticized the great Matt Damon, who narrated a new pro-public school film called “Backpack Full of Cash,” because the film criticizes privatization. The film was made by professional filmmakers.I urge everyone to arrange a screening in your community (public television showed a four-part series called “School” by the same team in 2000, but won’t touch “Backpack” because it’s too controversial).
Allen criticizes me too, because I flipped from being a supporter of charters to being an outspoken critic. She blames my conversion on my friendship with a union leader.
She had me stumped there.
Did she mean Al Shanker? He was president of the American Federation of Teachers when I first met him in 1974. He read my first book, a history of the New York City public schools, and he called out of the blue to say he loved it.
He wrote a weekly column in the New York Times, and he asked, “Do you want me to praise it or blast it?” We became good friends, had dinner, exchanged ideas. In the late 1980s, I visited newly freed Soviet satellite nations as part of an AFT group promoting democracy and civic education. Arch-conservative Checker Finn was part of the same group sponsored by the AFT. We visited Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania to talk to newly unionized teachers. Al Shanker was a great intellectual and one of my heroes. I was proud to call him my friend.
Did Allen mean Sandy Feldman? I knew her for many years too. I had many great dinners with her and her husband Arthur Barnes.
Maybe she meant Randi Weingarten? I have known Randi since 1998. I consider her a close friend, although I admit we sometimes have fights over issues. We differ over the Common Core; she likes it, I don’t. We differ over charters. She likes some (the ones that join the union), I see them as the gateway to privatization. Despite our differences, we agree on the importance of public education, a strong teaching profession, well-funded schools, and the right of workers to join unions to bargain collectively.
I am also friendly with Lily Eskelsen Garcia, presidency of the NEA. we shared an evening of pizza and wine and laughs in my apartment not so long ago.
I have never belonged to a union, but I believe in them as democratic institutions. Jeanne Allen and her libertarian friends hate teachers’ unions, and they think they can smear people by accusing them of being friends of unions. The reactionary right has done a good job of destroying unions, and they hurt our democracy by their anti-unionism.
Here is why.
Unions give working people a collective voice. A single worker has no voice. They can be fired arbitrarily. Unions protect a teacher’s right to due process if their boss wants to fire them. They are entitled to a hearing and to know the charges against them. Unions fight to improve wages and working conditions. Unions protect public schools against budget cuts that harm education.
Above all, unions create a path into the middle class. As unions shrink, so does the middle class. As unions shrink, income inequality grows. Unions are especially important for people of color, who need a strong organization to fight for their job rights.
Jeanne Allen, Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump, the Koch brothers, and their billionaire buddies (some of whom are on the board of Allen’s Center for Education Reform) would like to roll back the New Deal. Not I. I want us to have a vibrant society, strong unions, well-funded public schools, a respected teaching profession, and a genuine narrowing of the income inequality that blights our society.
We need to strengthen the New Deal, not get rid of it. Public schools are part of the promise of America. We cannot let libertarians destroy our public institutions by privatizing them. The good news is that the public supports public schools, not privatization. There have been 19 state referenda on vouchers, and vouchers lost overwhelmingly every time. Last fall, Massachusetts held a referendum on whether to expand the number of charters, and the proposal was voted down in almost every school district in the state (only the rich districts, which did not want charters for themselves, voted in favor).
I confess: I favor public schools. I oppose charters and vouchers. I support teachers unions. I am proud of my friendship with union leaders.

By Will Kane, Common Sense News
Newfound confidence and feelings of safety. Concern about bullying. Changes in education. A worrying rise in legal questions about domestic violence and immigration. President Trump’s first 100 days in office have meant a variety of things to children, families and the people who care about them across the country.
Common Sense News spoke to children, parents, grandparents, teachers, lawyers and child advocates across the country to better understand what President Trump’s first months in office have meant to them. The conversations paint a complicated picture of a country trying to understand the Trump presidency. 
‘After Trump, I got my voice.’
At 6-feet-3 inches, Reece Sherrill is tall for a 14-year-old. He’s on his Indiana middle school’s basketball team but has found himself, he says, sitting on the bench more than he would like. He contemplated transferring schools and finding a new coach until he watched Trump on the national stage. 
“I liked his personality, he really gets to the point with stuff,” Reece said of Trump. So Reece, whose parents are lifelong Republicans, asked himself what Trump would do in his situation. He decided to talk with his coach. 
“I was just like, ‘Is there anyway I could get my minutes, I’ve been playing my butt off,” Reece said. To his surprise, Reece’s coach responded well and he ended up playing more. 
The moment was a turning point for Reece, who found that by emulating some of Trump’s candor, he found a new of way interacting with the world. 
“I wouldn’t have said that before,” Reece said. “I feel like I would have just held back and kept everything in. I would have gotten sad or mad.”
“After Trump, I got my voice a little bit,” he added. “I say what I mean.”
A teacher tunes in, soothes fears
The day after the election, Sarah La Due, a 7th grade English teacher in El Cerrito, Calif., felt like she had let her diverse classroom of students down. “I felt like as adult we had betrayed for them the world we told them they were living in,” she said.
But since then, the teacher has doubled-down on her efforts to create an inclusive, sympathetic and informed classroom. Her school, Korematsu Middle, was recently named one of the most diverse in the San Francisco Bay Area.
La Due has made a point of never asking her students about their immigration status, although she knows the issue concerns any of her students. A fellow teacher learned a student’s father had been deported the morning before she came to school. 
“I am more in tune to listening to their conversations, especially about deportation or immigrants,” La Due said. “A lot of times they make jokes about it. They use humor to cover up anxiety or fear.”
In response, La Due and her colleagues have been handing out cards from the ACLU that give advice in English and Spanish on how to speak with immigration agents. 
La Due has also focused on current events, with special units on spotting fake news and bias. 
“We did a lesson on pizza gate,” she said, referencing a popular conspiracy theory involving Hillary’s Clinton’s campaign and a pizza restaurant. “We’ve analyzed MSNBC news clips and Fox News clips and talked about how we saw bias.”
A deeper understanding of religion and identity 
In Houston, Trump’s presidency has been unsettling for Saadia Faruqi, her husband and two children. The Muslim family has long felt welcome in Houston, which has one of the largest Pakistani populations in the country. But increasingly there have been flashes of hostility, especially at school with her 10-year-old son, Mubashir.
“Somebody said to my son, ‘You’re going to be kicked out,’” she said. “He very calmly turned around to the guy and said, ‘You’re so dumb. I am an American citizen, I won’t be kicked out.’” 
Mubashir, who has been the victim of bullying even before Trump became President, has found new friendships with his classmates from Latin America in the last few months. “All of his friends are suddenly Hispanic,” Faruqi said. “I asked him why and he told me, ‘People hate Muslims and Mexicans, so I figured we have to stay together.”
Bullying has increased, even as “teachers don’t take it seriously,” Faruqi said. Other students “call my son a terrorist and I complain to the teachers and they laugh and say the kids don’t watch TV. I feel it is more blatant now. ”
Faruqi, a writer, said she has felt the animosity herself when she’s out at the supermarket or running errands. 
“I feel like people are more able to say things that they maybe would not have said before,” she said.
But, Faruqi said, “I have also had people who have been acting more friendly than they would have before.”
And Mubashir has found a deeper appreciation for his religion. 
“I have seen that he is more willing to speak out about Muslims about Islam,” Faruqi said. “The other day, a friend asked why he wasn’t eating pork and he said that’s what the Koran said. I was proud of him. At his age he doesn’t want to have a religious conversation. Every word is ‘whatever.’” 
A threat to education
For Diane Ravitch, one of the leading advocates of traditional public education, President Trump’s first 100 days in office have been bleak. 
“I think the most important thing he has done is appoint a secretary of education who is not a fan of public schools,” Ravitch said, referring to Betsy DeVos, a Michigan philanthropist who has no teaching experience and never attended public school. “I think she represents a very serious threat to public education.”
Ravitch, a former assistant secretary of education under President George H.W. Bush, said she worried Trump’s plan to let parents choose their child’s school could permanently undermine funding for public schools. 
“I think that this could be very serious for the future of public education, pretty ominous.”
But not all the developments are distressing: DeVos’ confirmation hearing “became the fodder for late-night talk shows,” Ravitch said, generating new interest in public schools.
Membership in Ravitch’s Network for Public Education, a public school advocacy group, has surged from 22,000 members in September to 350,000 members today. 
“People who never knew there was a secretary of education are now interested in the public education,” she said. “People became very aware because she is a lightning rod.”
In this Chicago home, a break from the news
Sonya Strenge, 36, had prepared what she would say to her 3-year-old daughter when Hillary Clinton won the election. But when she realized Trump would win, she turned off the news. 
“I’ve never turned it back on,” she said. “My husband and I have kind of decided to shield her from this.”
Strenge and her husband occasionally watch topical comedians like Samantha Bee and Seth Meyers after their daughter Linnea goes to bed, but have otherwise avoided the news, which used to be a big part of their evening routine. 
“Our media consumption has definitely changed,” she said. “We are very selective of what we want her to be consuming and very selective of what we watch in front of her.”
As Linnea gets older, Strenge thinks she’ll introduce more details about policy, activism and voting. But for now, Strenge wants her to focus on being a child.
“She’ll be in elementary school in two years, I am sure they are going to talk about the President,” Strenge said. “I don’t want to blind her and say, ‘We don’t have a President, honey.’”
New worry about police, violence
Like any grandma, Nadida Matin, 50, worries about her grandchildren. As a black, Muslim woman living in St. Louis she’s acutely aware of the threats she and her family can face from the government. 
Her step-son, Abdul Kamal, was killed by police in New Jersey in 2013 and Trump’s support for police and lack of interest in reform makes her feel at risk. Kamal was unarmed, and was shot after he refused to take his hands out of his pockets, a New Jersey newspaper reported. Police called the shooting justified.
“Being a Muslim and having (Trump) say he is a law-and-order candidate, and having a step-son murdered by the police makes that even more concerning,” she said. 
Matin is raising three of her grandchildren, ages 8, 10 and 11, and has made a point to talk to them about how to interact with the police.
“I tell them not to be fearful, to be engaged and know your own presence and strength; don’t be disrespectful,” she said. “We don’t allow them to go to the park unless we’re present. Stay in safe places. Don’t do things that would have people look at you as something other than your authentic self.” 
But Matin, a lifelong activist, has also found that Trump’s presidency has revealed hard truths about race in America. 
“Trump, he brought those thing to light that most people don’t want to talk about,” she said. “His being elected just made us have those conversations that we struggle with. He took away our ability to be ignorant to what’s going on. You no longer have the luxury to sit on the side lines.”
Feelings of safety in small-town Indiana
Rachel Kidd, 14, plays tennis and is on the cheerleading squad at her middle school in Bedford, Indiana, a town of 13,000 people. She wants to become a marine biologist or practice art.
But Kidd also worries about what she sees in the news: the threat of terrorism, ISIS and rising extremism. And so far she’s been very pleased with Trump’s aggressive approach to those issues.
""With us being in small town, I know we’re not directly involved in that stuff,” she said, referring to the threats of terrorism often felt in large cities like New York, Paris or London. “But what he’s doing makes us feel safer.”
“One thing that President Trump was really big on was protecting America and America First, and he stayed true for that; he has not let refugees in so far,” she said. 
Kidd knows some people are threatened and hurt by Trump’s immigration policies, but she feels those stories are overplayed by the media. 
“I hope that he continues to keep our country safe and stops many of the terrorist groups and the terrorist attacks,” she said.
A choice for parents when it comes to school?
For years, Neal McCluskey, an education scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, has argued that parents should be able to take their child out of a failing public school and put them in a charter or private school of their choice. If schools compete, he argues, children win.
Donald Trump might make that a real thing. 
Trump has said he supports school choice, and DeVos, his secretary of education, has long supported the policy. Neither have proposed detailed policy proposals. 
But as much as he supports reforming the traditional public school system, McCluskey hopes Trump and DeVos will let states and local communities find their own way to the policy. 
“I am pleased with the administration’s at least rhetorical move away from federal control of education, including Secretary DeVos stating multiple times in her confirmation hearing that education decisions are properly made at the state, local, or family level, not in Washington,” McCluskey said in an e-mail. 
A strict reading of the Constitution gives the federal government little authority over local schools, he said. 
“If the federal government tries to bribe or otherwise incentivize states to adopt choice programs we run a huge risk of the feds eventually regulating all private schools, rendering choice largely meaningless,” he said.
In Los Angeles, new interest in immigration rules 
Jimena Vasquez is a family law attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. In the last few months she’s seen a spike in the number of immigrant single mothers asking for help getting a passport for their citizen children without permission from the child’s father. 
In many cases, Vasquez said, the men have been abusive and the mothers want to know how they can get a passport without the permission of their child’s father, which the State Department usually requires. 
If an immigrant parent is deported, a passport will give their child an easy way to return to America when they grow older. 
“I think among immigrants it is a valid concern of immigration enforcement,” Vasquez said. “If people are going to leave, they want to leave with their child. It is easier to get a passport here than it is there.”
The State Department is usually cooperative, Vasquez said, but the process can require unfamiliar and burdensome paperwork. 
A renaissance of interest in local education
When Amanda Litman, a former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer, started Run for Something to encourage progressive millennials to run for local office, she hoped 100 people would sign up. Three months into Trump’s presidency, 9,000 have, and nearly a quarter have expressed interest in running for their local school board. 
“I think folks are seeing that elections have consequences, especially for our kids,” she said. 
That includes people like Shae Ashe, 27, who told NPR he decided to run for school board in his Pennsylvania town because “what happens on the local level is affecting your daily life.""

That was why it is so sad that Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, i.e. Scott Walker lite, and the Obama administration help pave the way for his union-bashing and did little to help working people in the Wisconsin recall campaigns.",2015-09-07,EDUCATION,"Even an oil field rookie, ""a worm,"" knows that his life is in the hands of his tool pusher. So, in my first day as a roughneck in the oil patch, it was unnerving to hear Dwayne shout into the radio, ""Frack after dark! Frack after dark! Call Western! Eddy Chiles (subsequently the owner of the Texas Rangers) loves to frack after dark!"" 
By today's terminology, we actually were being told to perforate a well after dark, but it still placed everyone's lives at risk. It meant we would be working with explosives that could be unknowingly detonated by a trucker 100 miles away as he spoke on his CB radio. That winter, had such an explosion occurred a few seconds earlier, our entire crew would have died; even so one roughneck was pronounced dead at the scene. 
My tool pusher told me, ""John, I'm a high school dropout so I'll do what I'm told. But, you have a future."" If we have to frack after dark, Dwight told me to quit this job and hitchhike home.
This may be the single most unnerving of my experiences in the blue collar world, but it's hard to believe how many times the bosses, in so many different workplaces, gambled with our lives. Whether it was being required to handle explosives or radioactive materials without following procedures, unloading trucks full of toxic fumes, hefting too much weight around machinery without the legally-required security protectors, or just taking the risks required to deal up with a sped-up assembly line, our health, safety, and survival was unimportant to the big boys.
As a teacher, our real danger was stress. Gangbangers threated their classmates but not authority figures. The stress from counseling traumatized students, visiting them in the hospital, attending their funerals, and worrying over unconscious teens could threaten our health, but it was nothing compared to what our kids had to handle. My last couple of years in the regular classroom, I started to get sick at my stomach when drenched in a student's blood. Twice, after breaking up fights, I had a morbid fixation on the only drop of blood that landed on my shirt (once on the sleeve and once on the collar) even though my face and arms were covered in red. Of course, the persons who really suffered were the students whose blood was spraying everywhere. 
I was reminded of these working conditions in the blue collar world and inner city schools while reading Dan Kaufman's ""Labor's Last Stand,"" in the New York Times Magazine. Kaufman warns that only 11% of American workers and 7% of private sector workers belong to unions. The NEA is the nation's largest union, and teachers unions are the largest defender of working people and the poor that is still standing. Reactionaries like Scott Walker, the Koch brothers, and ALEC understand the stakes. If they can destroy public sector unions, the last chance to reunite working people may be gone permanently.
In union there is strength. That was why it is so sad that Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, i.e. Scott Walker lite, and the Obama administration help pave the way for his union-bashing and did little to help working people in the Wisconsin recall campaigns.
That is also why Walker pretended to not be an existential threat to private sector unions and claimed that his fight to the death with public sector unions did not foreshadow an all-out assault on public and higher education. Only after he had picked off one opponent after another did Walker cut education spending by $2 billion and ram through Right to Work. When pushing a $300 million cut to higher education, he promised universities freedom from ""shared governance,"" which ""kept the university from directly running things"" and told professors to work harder. 
Unions have always been some of the most loyal members of the civil rights coalition, as well as crusaders for economic justice. And, we have usually had the same opponents. As Kaufman recalls, a founder of the Right to Work movement, Vance Muse, explained the need for its banning of otherwise legal, negotiated agreements, ""White women and white men will be forced into organizations with black African apes, whom they will have to call 'brother' or lose their jobs.""
Kaufman also notes that roads in the Right to Work state of Texas don't cost half as much to build, even though workers get paid that much less. ""So,"" as a union leader says, ""it is only a question of who makes the money -- the workers or the owners.""
It is one thing for a right-winger to oppose the rights of working people, but there is no intellectually honest way for a liberal to be an ally of Right to Work and to still pose as pro-civil rights. On the other hand, the neo-liberal corporate reformers who opened the door for Walker are nothing if they aren't inconsistent. They will say anything, do almost anything, and ally themselves with virtually any true believer in uncontrolled competition to clear the way for top-down, market-driven school reforms.
Sadly, one reason why elite education reformers don't understand the essential role of labor in working for justice is that too many of them have no experience in the blue collar working world. If the rank-in-file of the corporate reform movement had more experience in the industrial world, they would have seen how little the lives of workers are worth. Kaufman explains, for instance, that the fatality rate for construction workers is 40% higher in Right to Work states.
Virtually every remnant of the social safety net is now at risk. Middle and working class families are just one medical crisis away from poverty. Now more than ever, test-driven, competition-driven reformers should reconsider their neo-liberalism and rethink their contempt for organized labor. They should face up to the single biggest question. Even if they can't get over their distaste for teachers and unions, and even if they don't have any personal contact with blue collar workers, how can they continue to sow discord among the ranks of progressives? If they help destroy organized labor, who will replace us in the fight for civil rights and economic justice? 
Being a teacher, I must also add a footnote. Kaufman makes another point that especially should speak to educators. The Wisconsin unions that Walker targeted take care of the professional development of its high-skilled workers. Without unions, safety and the quality of construction will decline. And that raises a question. Who would teachers and patrons trust more to provide staff training to educators -- the AFT and the NEA or the non-educators TNTP and, the Gates Foundation?

280,EDUCATION,Understanding Your Finances After Your Child Is Accepted to College,"WiserAdvisor.com, ContributorFinancial advisor matching site",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/understanding-your-financ_b_7440976.html,"When your child gets an acceptance letter to college, you might feel excited - but also worried about money.",2015-05-27,EDUCATION,"By Paula Pant, WiserAdvisor.com contributor
When your child gets an acceptance letter to college, you might feel excited - but also worried about money.
College can be a huge expense. The idea of paying five-figures per school year might leave you feeling overwhelmed. 
If you plan on helping your child finance their education, and you could use some help, read on for practical tips to make college less of a financial burden.
Review Financial Aid Packages
The first thing you need to do is review all the financial aid or award packages colleges sent you upon acceptance. These should break down what aid is being offered, and what you'll be responsible for.
Are you unclear on anything in the award letter? Don't be afraid to call up the Financial Aid office and ask for clarification. They understand you're concerned. After all, you wouldn't blindly sign for a mortgage, right?
If your financial situation has changed since you filled out the FAFSA application, you need to call the Financial Aid office and inform them. The amount of aid your child is eligible for may have changed. 
Additionally, if you don't think your child has enough aid, look for scholarships and grants. You can always inquire about work-study opportunities on campus that may be available to your child as well. 
Dispersing Funds
If you have savings within a 529 plan that you need to withdraw to pay for college, you can ask the plan administrator to issue a check to the account owner, the student, or the school.
There's no penalty for issuing a check to the account owner or the student as long as the funds are used for qualified expenses, though you'll need solid documentation of these expenses in case the IRS inquires. Make sure to pay these expenses in the same calendar year that you withdraw the funds.
Issuing a check directly to the school makes accounting easier, but might impact your financial aid package: some schools view 529 as 'scholarship' money and reduce their financial aid offers accordingly. If the account owner is a ""third party"" like a grandparent, there's increased risk of the school viewing this as 'scholarship' income; in these instances, it's better to change account ownership to the parent.
When it comes to how loans are disbursed, the process is hands-off. The lender will credit the funds to your child's account at school and apply it toward necessary expenses, such as tuition and room and board. 
Maintaining Financial Aid
You want to make sure your child's financial aid package will hold steady and cover them throughout their years away. If there aren't any drastic changes to your financial situation, your child's coverage should stay the same.
However, there are a few factors out of your control that may have an impact on their aid. 
One is the school itself. Colleges are notorious for raising tuition every year. Luckily, according to collegeboard.org, tuition only rose 2.2 percent between the 2004-2005 and 2014-2015 school years for private four-year schools, and 3.5 percent for public four-year schools. 
Second, if your child has any scholarships, know the required GPA they need to keep for them. Your child may get a warning or a second chance to raise their grades, but scholarships can be revoked. If your child's GPA drops dramatically, they may even become ineligible for federal aid. 
Don't Forget Saving For Retirement
Helping your child afford higher education shouldn't come at the expense of your retirement.
If you've taken on student loan debt that you'll repay on behalf of your child, you need to learn how to balance saving for retirement and repaying the loans.
Direct PLUS loans and most private loans enter repayment after being fully paid out, according to studentaid.ed.gov. Be ready for that by fitting the payment into your budget beforehand. 
If you've been steadily saving for retirement, try not to make any changes. Make sure you're contributing enough to your 401(k) to be eligible for your employer's match, if you have one. Otherwise, aim to max out any IRAs you have.
The biggest mistake you can make is putting off saving for retirement because you overextended yourself with student loan debt. 
Feeling uncertain about being able to balance all of your financial goals? It could be a good idea to sit down with your financial advisor to go over your options. Work together to create a plan that will lead you to a successful retirement. 
Having Difficulty Paying?
Making room for student loan payments doesn't have to be difficult, especially if you have a Direct PLUS loan. 
While this loan needs to be repaid after it's disbursed, you have the option to defer it if your child is still enrolled in school at least half-time. You can also apply for a six-month deferment after your child has graduated or dropped below half-time status.
Be aware that deferring your loans stops your payments, but interest still accrues. It's best to start repaying as soon as you can to avoid the capitalization of interest once the deferment ends. 
You also have two repayment options - graduated repayment and extended repayment. Both options will make it easier to manage payments in the beginning.
If you need help making payments on private student loans, call your lender immediately. Some may be able to offer you assistance. 
Don't forget that interest paid toward student loans is also tax deductible.
Be Prepared
By reading this article, you're already a step closer to being financially prepared to handle your child going off to college. 
Don't let the cost get in the way of sharing in the excitement and joy. Sending your child to college is a momentous event. The more confident you feel about your financial plan, the more you'll be able to relax and enjoy the experience.

Here's another poisonous tropical plant: Metopium brownei, the black poisonwood tree. Black poisonwood looks harmless enough until you see its bark, which tends to ooze--wait for it--poisonous black stuff. People who live in Central America and the Caribbean where the tree grows plentifully know to stay away. But tourists often get some first-hand knowledge of the tree's poisonous effects by brushing up against it. Both the bark and the leaves contain a chemical called urushiol, the active chemical in poison ivy. Luckily, an antidote is almost always close by. Bursera simaruba, the gumbo-limbo tree, often grows within a few meters of black poisonwood, and it contains antioxidants that can dull the effects of urushiol... keep reading.

But a growing body of research is revealing the real extent to which significant others affect each other's mental and physical states. Most recently, researchers at the University of Michigan found couples who have been together 50 or more years have strikingly similar kidney function, cholesterol levels, and grip strength. These physical health factors add to research from another group out of the University of British Columbia who found that, as couples age together, they are more likely to experience similar levels of happiness and depression... keep reading.

That's where What3Words, a new system for mapping the globe, comes in handy. What3Words breaks the world down into 3 x 3 meter squares, each of which is randomly assigned a three-word address. The Taj Mahal becomes according.gloom.broads; Tiananmen Square is now emails.privately.fleet; and the Pentagon is at acting.brass.rare. Inevitably, this makes for some hilarious and silly addresses.

It's pretty much the perfect drink for the conditions inside an airline cabin. The constant loud noise of being inside an airplane warps our taste preferences to prefer umami, or savory, tastes. The effect is only amplified by the fact that other tastes, like salty and sweet, are duller in loud environments... keep reading.

282,EDUCATION,Saturday Mornings Like Poetry,"Write for the Future, ContributorCollege Admissions Essay Program",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saturday-mornings-like-po_b_5537814.html,,2014-06-27,EDUCATION,"by Ryan Shepard

I remember when Saturday mornings were like poetry: the rainbow colored fruity pebbles sitting in my spoon, a fluffy teddy bear brilliantly named Teddy, the sounds of Ahmad Rashad previewing the day's NBA games, and the sounds of my brother trying to play basketball, indoors. Then there was the day's biggest gift--my own personal gentle giant whom I called Dad, author of the poem. His everlasting line was that incredibly wide grin he wore across his face. He seamlessly presented Saturday's poetry as smooth as the feel of his casket ten years ago. Today I am evolving with the memory of the poems along with the wide grin that travelled with him everywhere. Now they guide my definitions of comfort and confidence.
Seven years after I put his casket behind me, I picked up the pen, paper and microphone that were in front of me. My talents grew as wide as my father's grin, but on my own terms. The younger me wanted to be just like him--part of me still does. Yet I'm more artistic than he could have ever imagined. Last spring, I filled sheet after sheet of paper, exposing innermost secrets by way of poetry and music. In doing so, I came to expand my own grin. On the stage of a packed ballroom at Disney World, I performed my poem, ""17 Dreams"", which takes the reader into my visions of my future. With each line, I gauged the audience's reaction, opening myself to new vulnerabilities but also becoming more confident and comfortable with myself. My grin became a bit wider, almost like my dad's smile way back when.
Poetic memories of my father's Saturday grins carried me from North Plainfield Middle School lunch lines into ninth grade at Choate Rosemary Hall. I suddenly found myself amongst those born with golden spoons or even famous last names. I questioned my place among them. Nonetheless, I grew to see the value of my Saturday morning spoon even more, thanks partially to Colin Lord, a mentor and admissions director at Choate who once detected a little self-doubt in me. He said, ""We wouldn't have brought you here if we didn't think that you could handle it."" 
My talents grew, but on my own terms. I became president of the Choate Afro-Latino Student Alliance and Slam Poetry clubs. I was also named Prefect, becoming a student mentor to freshmen. As a Choate elder, I now share stories of my experiences with others, such as my first track meet as a freshman. My legs pounded against the red pavement of the track during the first race. I was nearly fifty yards ahead of my only competitor, when it hit me: I had broken into a sprint too quickly. I was that young, naive freshman who thought he could sprint 400 meters. Meter by meter, I could feel the senior runner coming up behind me, ultimately beating me by a full 50 meters. As I neared the finish line, I heard the voices of both my parents: ""It's not the end all, be all.""
My dad's grin, smile, voice, presence and spirit are still powerful forces in my life. My reality opposes all the studies that suggest I am lucky to be a part of the 4% of boarding school students who are African-American and not the nearly one million blacks who are incarcerated. These figures are mere background chatter to me. My father taught me well; his influence has weakened and trumped those studies. My goal now, above anything else, is to continue to grow into my own person and solidify my own incredible grin.
Ryan Shepard, a recent Choate Rosemary Hall graduate, will be attending American University this fall.

283,EDUCATION,Deconstructing The New SAT,"Jed Applerouth, ContributorTeacher, speaker and an educational innovator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/deconstructing-the-new-sa_b_5206926.html,"If admissions officers do not see the value in a test that is better aligned with the Common Core and continue to assign equal weight to both tests, the new SAT will be in a precarious position as students migrate in droves to the ACT.",2014-04-29,EDUCATION,"The plot thickens. When we outlined last month the major changes coming to the SAT, we commented that the ""new"" SAT seemed suspiciously like a knock-off of the increasingly popular ACT. We've had a week to scrutinize the College Board's 208-page preview of the redesigned SAT and what we found was a bit more complicated: a new SAT that clearly imitates its rival in certain areas, diverges in others, but reflects the Common Core State Standards throughout. We knew David Coleman, president of the College Board and former participant in the Common Core State Standards Initiative (CCSSI), would bring the SAT closer to the Common Core, but this redesigned SAT is so closely tied to the Core standards that it may very well sink or swim with them. The College Board's strategy could backfire by alienating students and leaving the ACT the undisputed college admission test of choice; alternatively, it could earn the SAT new legitimacy in the marketplace as the more rigorous and better Common Core-aligned assessment. If admissions officers perceive the new SAT as the better test, student opinion regarding the tests won't matter.
So what exactly is changing in the new SAT? What are the implications for students? And will these changes help the College Board catch up with ACT, Inc.? Let's take a closer look.
Timing
Historically the SAT has put less of a focus than the ACT on processing speed. In his 2013 NACAC address, Coleman referenced that speed may play even less of a role on the new SAT, and the details of the redesigned SAT confirm this. Let's compare the time allotted per question for the SAT and ACT:
Seconds Per Question: 
Compared to the ACT, the new SAT will allow students more time per question on each of the three sections: 33% more time on the grammar section, 43% more time on the reading section, and 40% more time on the math section. On the math section that allows calculators, the new SAT will allow a whopping 49% more time per question than the ACT. This is effectively akin to receiving 50% extended time on the ACT, without receiving any accommodation.
Students with slower processing speeds who are unable to attain an accommodation for extended time on the ACT may fare better on the more generously timed SAT.
Conclusion: Timing = Advantage SAT
Common Core Alignment
The SAT in its current form lags behind the ACT in Common Core alignment. But with this redesign, the SAT did not just play catch-up: it leapfrogged its rival. Sensitive to the political controversy that has recently embroiled the CCSSI (with states like Indiana withdrawing from the standards altogether) the College Board writers explicitly mention the Common Core only once in the 208-page description of the redesigned SAT. But don't be fooled; scratch ever so slightly beneath the surface of the new SAT, and you hit a Common Core gold mine. The redesigned SAT is effectively a 12-grade Common Core assessment designed to rival the forthcoming tests from PARCC and Smarter Balanced, consortia tasked by the Department of Education with developing the Common Core tests for the 21 century. And this redesigned SAT is just the first step: The College Board explicitly revealed plans to release similar Common-Core tests for every grade level, from middle school to high school.
Conclusion: Common Core Alignment = Advantage SAT
So how exactly did the ACT and the Common Core standards influence the redesign of the SAT? Let's dive in to the individual sections for a deeper understanding.
Writing
For years the SAT has tested students' grammar and rhetorical skills primarily using error IDs and sentence improvements -- question types that are completely devoid of any context. The ACT, in contrast, has tested these skills in the context of passages drawn from a variety of academic domains. The ACT's method of assessing writing skills is better aligned with the Common Core Language Arts standards specifying that students be able to ""Apply knowledge of language to understand how language functions in different contexts, to make effective choices for meaning or style, and to comprehend more fully when reading or listening"" (CCSS.ELA-Literacy.L11-12.1). The College Board writers, rather than struggling to develop a new format, simply copied that of the ACT, placing error-ridden passages on the left side of the page and multiple choice problems offering edits on the right. The Writing section of the redesigned SAT steals so unabashedly from ACT English that when placed side by side these two sections are nearly indistinguishable.
A major content change to the redesigned SAT is the addition of redundancy questions and punctuation questions that test commas, semicolons, and colons. These question types have typically constituted over 20% of ACT English questions, but have been conspicuously absent from the SAT.
The most unfortunate change to SAT Writing -- adding charts and tables to the end of select passages -- seems completely contrived. Amidst questions covering the proper use of commas, verb tenses, and prepositional phrases, students will be asked to accurately read data in a bar graph. What does data analysis have to do with grammar? Nothing whatsoever. The College Board is attempting to integrate the Common Core standards that are currently measured on the ACT Science section without adding an SAT Science section and blatantly ripping off the ACT. However, sticking charts and tables into a section designed to measure grammar and rhetorical skills is at best an awkward solution, and is certainly a distraction from the primary task at hand.
Conclusion: Writing = Advantage ACT
The Essay
Like the ACT, the redesigned SAT is going to offer an optional essay at the conclusion of the normal testing administration. The College Board doubled the length of its current essay from 25 to 50 minutes (making it 20 minutes longer than the ACT essay) and shifted the focus from creative writing to analysis. The new essay prompt asks students to explain how an author builds an argument and strengthens the logic and persuasiveness of a position. This is no opinion piece. The closing sentence of the prompt makes that clear: ""Your essay should not explain whether you agree with [the author's] claims, but rather explain how [the author] builds an argument to persuade his audience."" This new essay will be more useful in assessing students' analytical and reasoning skills, but many students may be wary of spending 50 minutes on a writing assignment after completing a nearly 4-hour test administration. Logistically, placing an optional essay at the end may make sense, but it will prove burdensome for some students.
Conclusion: Essay = Advantage ACT
Reading
The College Board is bringing the SAT Reading test closer to the Common Core standards primarily by mimicking the ACT Reading section. The most significant difference between the two tests is now gone: the SAT has wholesale abandoned sentence completions. Rather than ask students to complete a sentence with an ""SAT word"" like surfeit or obsequious, the redesigned SAT will ask students to define easier words like intense or channel using the context of a passage.
Like the ACT, the SAT Reading section will consist of passages that are no more than 750 words long and always come from the domains of Science, Literature, and Humanities/Social Studies. In addition, the College Board will inject ACT Science-style charts, graphs, and figures into the science passages. Thankfully, this clear attempt to compensate for not having its own dedicated Science section works significantly better here, where students are already being asked to comprehend a scientific passage, than it did in the new Writing section.
One notable difference between the new SAT and the ACT is the SAT's inclusion on each test of one passage drawn from a U.S. founding document or from the ""Great Global Conversation."" The sample essay provided in last week's preview-a speech given on the floor of the House during the Nixon impeachments-seemed to place non-American students at a significant disadvantage, contrary to Coleman's stated goals of ""expanding access"" to more and more students. Students who did not grow up exposed to the subtleties of Congressional hearings, public debate, and the Constitutional balance of powers would lack key context and be at a significant disadvantage on this passage. If this reflects the forthcoming content on the revised SAT, many international students will swiftly migrate to the ACT.
Conclusion: Reading = Advantage TBD
Math
On the new SAT Math test, students will face tougher problems but have more time to solve them. New questions will emphasize ""conceptual understanding"" over heuristics and speed, and, on one of the two Math sections, students will be barred from using their calculators.
Algebra will be the king of the redesigned SAT Math section. According to the numbers offered in this week's preview, geometry will be taking a major backseat: going from a whopping 40% of questions on the current SAT to a mere 10% on the redesigned test. In addition, just about every advanced math topic that is currently tested by the ACT and not the SAT (from trigonometry and radians to equations of a circle and congruence theorems) has been added to a new category called, eloquently enough, ""Additional Topics in Math.""
Nowhere on the new SAT is the move towards Common Core alignment more profoundly evident than in the redesigned Math section. For example, take a look at the College Board's language outlining the first two skills tested by the new ""Heart of Algebra"" category of questions:
 1. Create, solve, or interpret linear equations in one variable.2. Create, solve, or interpret linear inequalities in one variable. 
Compare this language to that of the first Common Core standard in High School Algebra:
 1. Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them to solve problems. 
This minor rewording is indicative of just how deeply the new Math section is tied to the Common Core. The new SAT Math questions drive right through the heart of Common Core by relying less upon heuristic problem solving (i.e., when you see this kind of problem, employ this strategy) and more upon conceptual understanding of math principles. As an example, whereas the current SAT would present a complex word problem about cars travelling at different speeds and ask:
 How long after the second car leaves will it catch up to the first car?A) 17 minutesB) 30 minutes 
The new SAT would more likely ask:
 Which of the follow mathematical equations represents the scenario described?A) 3x + 4y - 19 = 230B) 4x + 3y - 19 = 180 
What's the difference? The first version allows students to work backwards from given answer choices or employ other problem-solving approaches to arrive at the answer. The second version requires a conceptual understanding of how the variables in a mathematical equation align to real life scenarios. This change better aligns the question with Common Core standards, which put a premium on math ""fluency"" and understanding.
At first glance, not only is the new SAT math section better aligned with the Common Core, but it is poised to be more challenging than either the current SAT or ACT math sections. The 26 sample math questions provided in the preview document were, on average, more difficult than current SAT questions, and several of the sample questions significantly raised the SAT skill ceiling. We were particularly surprised by the difficulty of the questions on the non-calculator section, which will certainly pose a challenge for many students.
Conclusion: Math = Advantage ACT
Implications
By seemingly designing its new test entirely around the Common Core standards, the College Board is attempting to position itself as the only legitimate test that reflects high school coursework. However, the growing opposition to the new standards poses a genuine risk to the College Board: the SAT may very well sink or swim with the Common Core State Standards.
The SAT is becoming a harder test, and the elevated difficulty level of the redesigned SAT will unquestionably drive many college-bound students towards the ACT. Given the choice between two assessments that are equally weighted in the college admissions process, apart from those students who will gravitate towards the new SAT for its laxer timing demands, who would choose the harder test?
The College Board is not making a play for student popularity; it is endeavoring to convince admissions offices across the country that it is the only legitimate game in town. The College Board wins the game if college admissions officers come to perceive the SAT as a more rigorous and valuable assessment and begin encouraging students to take it over the ACT. If admissions officers do not see the value in a test that is better aligned with the Common Core and continue to assign equal weight to both tests, the new SAT will be in a precarious position as students migrate in droves to the ACT. This is quite a gamble: the directors of the College Board clearly have some moxie. Now we must await the competitive response of the ACT Inc., to see if it will hold the course that has served it well over the past few years, or make a bold move of its own to reclaim the title of the nation's ""most aligned"" assessment.

284,EDUCATION,A Tree Without Roots: Astroturf and Corporate Education Reform,"Yohuru Williams, ContributorHistorian, professor, education activist and author of Teachin...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-tree-without-roots-astr_b_6001088.html,"There is no question of the cancerous effects of groups like PennCAN and the Commonwealth Foundation. It may be years before we know the full range of the damage they have inflicted on our children and schools or how long it will take to repair that damage. One thing, however, is clear: Philadelphia teachers and students deserve our interest and support.",2014-10-21,EDUCATION,"The Commonwealth Foundation, a conservative think tank, reportedly compensated counterprotesters in Philadelphia on Thursday in a failed effort to give the appearance of popular support for the recent move by the Philadelphia School Reform Commission (SRC) to abrogate the contracts of Philadelphia teachers. This is yet another sign of the dangers of corporate education reform and the lengths its proponents are willing to go to stifle dissent and subvert democracy, including resorting to the use of astroturfing, or ""fake grassroots"" demonstrations and groups. 
When their plan was uncovered, a spokesperson for the foundation was forced to admit that the organization officially engaged a dozen people to hold signs and distribute literature backing the actions of the SRC and attacking the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers (PFT) union. ""We will be there, not to counter-protest but to inform the public of how the PFT has failed teachers and students,"" said Cindy Hamill-Dahlgren, Director of Strategic Communication, trying to spin the group's actions. 
Hamill-Dahlgren nevertheless failed to address why her organization would not just be transparent. The answer, of course, is that the Commonwealth Foundation is desperately afraid of the real grassroots support for PFT not only in Philadelphia but across the country -- support highlighting the decision by the SRC as both unnecessary and unpopular. 
In spite of efforts by the Commonwealth Foundation and various other entities to paint teachers as the bad guys, a poll conducted by the Pew Charitable Trusts in September of 2013 found that 31 percent of residents placed responsibility for the crisis in the Philadelphia School District on the Republican-controlled state legislature and governor. Another 31 percent blamed the Democratic mayor and city council, and 21 percent blamed school administrators and the state-controlled State Reform Commission. Only 11 percent of those surveyed held the union or teachers responsible.
This is ultimately why the Commonwealth Foundation likely felt the need to hire counterprotesters. The fact that they were willing to go to this extreme was of little surprise to Philadelphia teachers. They know that much of the drama in the city has been orchestrated by shadowy behind-the-scenes organizations with popular-sounding names but funded by billionaires who have been very clear about the agenda to destroy the teachers' union on their road to dismantling the public schools. Their broad reach extends through state and local politics and knows no party bounds. Both Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, a Democrat, and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican, have received support from them -- apparently in exchange for supporting the corporate education reform agenda, including privatization of schools in the city of brotherly love. 
In the summer of 2013, for instance, Philadelphia news sources reported how an astroturf group called PennCAN secretly financed a poll that encouraged Corbett to blame the city's fiscal crisis on the PFT in a play to gain statewide support among conservative voters as he prepared to launch a bid for reelection.
PennCAN, like its sister organizations in other states, is Pennsylvania's arm of 50CAN, a national corporate education reform astroturf institution, amply funded by the Walton Family Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, that has been the chief proponent for privatization efforts, school closures, and the promotion of the use of school vouchers that allow tax dollars to be diverted from public education to pay private school tuition. 
There is a lesson for all of us in the perils of playing in astroturf that applies as much to the synthetic grass as to fake grassroots organizations. Experts have identified five potential dangers. They include injury, infections, overheating, poisoning and the presence of carcinogens.
While trying to give the appearance of popular support for their destructive actions, astroturf organizations like PennCAN and so-called ""think tanks"" like the Commonwealth Foundation actually cause injury. Budget cuts that resulted in the loss of school nurses and contributed to the deaths of two students is one aspect of that injury. The financial uncertainty that communities are forced to contend with is another, as every school year they confront the possibility of more teacher layoffs and school closures, not to mention larger class sizes and the loss of wrap-around service.
Infections are also common to AstroTurf. All kinds of nasty germs and diseases breed in the imitation materials that it comprises. Similarly, it would not be a stretch to suggest that the disease of indifference currently afflicting the Philadelphia schools was partly born of the desire of the corporate education reformers to wring profits from what they see as nothing more than a vast untapped market: our public schools. Their funding of astroturf organizations and think tanks and even the hiring of actors to push their agenda illustrates this.
AstroTurf is also subject to overheating. Unlike natural grass, Astroturf burns hot and stays hot long after the sun had faded. Last summer, when the Philadelphia Teachers Union, which, by all accounts, attempted to negotiate in good faith, offered a proposal that would have saved the district money and ensured a safe and timely opening of schools, the SRC, supported by the astroturfs, rejected it. They clearly preferred torching the union and, by extension, the schools and the communities they serve rather than engage in compromise.
Experts have noted how AstroTurf can lead to poisoning of the environment from chemicals in its fibers released during normal use. Fake grassroots organizations likewise poison the political environment by undermining democratic practices and eroding people's faith in the integrity of elected officials and the political process. They send the message that our democracy is for sale and that everything has a price, including the future of our children. 
Although the jury is still out on whether AstroTurf contributes to cancer, there is no question of the cancerous effects of groups like PennCAN and the Commonwealth Foundation. It may be years before we know the full range of the damage they have inflicted on our children and schools or how long it will take to repair that damage. One thing, however, is clear: Philadelphia teachers and students deserve our interest and support. We should all be observing carefully how events are unfolding there before the fake grass rug is pulled out from under another community, thereby exposing the hard, unfeeling and community-killing corporate education reform concrete that lies beneath.

285,EDUCATION,A Hack for Improving High School: Combine it With College and Career,"GenDIY, ContributorGenDIY",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-hack-for-improving-high_b_9439848.html,,2016-03-12,EDUCATION,"Joel Vargas & Hannah Smith, Jobs for the Future
Hack: a clever solution to a tricky problem
There is good news and bad news about today's high school students. The good news is that more students are finishing high school. Graduation rates have increased over four years to a high of 82 percent in the 2013-14 school year. And as college credentials have increasingly become a necessity for getting onto a career path with good wages, high school graduates get the message. Aside from a few dips during economic recessions, the percentage of high school graduates who go onto college has trended up over several decades. 
The bad news is that while many students take the step to start at a two-year or four-year college, too many stumble before finishing. Of those who go to college, a large number--and a disproportionate share from low-income families start in remedial courses and fail to ever advance into college-level work. 
This is not about students' lack of motivation or merit. The problem is that high schools are not preparing them for an economy that demands workers with more education, skills, and knowledge. Policymakers have largely tried to fix this by strengthening standards, curricula, and assessments to align what is learned within schools to what colleges and employers expect graduates to know. These are foundational efforts that should lead to large-scale improvements over time.
But we can also strengthen high schools now, borrowing lessons from innovative educators and students who have found an interesting hack for improving college and career outcomes. They are blending the high school experience with college and career, removing walls and boundaries between compulsory schooling and the next steps in learning and work.
Early college high schools, for example, use a blended approach and have produced incredible results. Early college students receive support to complete up to two years of college credit and earn an associate's degree as part of the high school curriculum. There are over 280 such schools around the country serving largely low-income and first generation college students, and many of the schools are located on college campuses. Rigorous research shows that early college schools ensure that more students finish high school and start and complete college credentials, including the roughly 30 percent who finish an associate's degree along with their high school diploma.
One of the reasons that early college works so well is that through the introduction to the postsecondary system, students have a structured, safe, and sanctioned testing ground to explore their limits. Developmentally, the time during and following high school can be fraught with uncertainty about one's path and identity. Through an early college experience, students are given the support and license they need to experiment, develop, and practice the academic habits and social norms that are integral to success in college (e.g., study skills, ability to manage one's own learning, knowing how and when to seek help from adults, navigating the financial aid system). The schools create an environment of exposure, exploration, academic rigor, and authentic rehearsal for a possible future self.
The same logic applies to schools trying a similar but different blending of college, career, and high school. In Linked Learning, high school students engage in work-based learning and take sequences of career and technical courses that prepare students for college and career, including college-level courses. Exposure here is also a key to student success. In addition to opportunities to take college courses, students in these high quality pathways are given the chance to apply what they learn in school and deepen academic and workplace skills in real-life work situations through internships, job shadows, and other work-based learning experiences.
The Wonderful Company is supporting and promoting practices consistent with early college and Linked Learning in the Central Valley of California. Several schools have created pathways in agricultural business management, plant science, and mechanics--all preparing students for four-year colleges while enabling them to complete an associate's degree by high school graduation or within one term after graduation. The schools are young, but the largely Latino, first-generation students that they serve are already showing early signs of strengthened academic achievement: at Wonderful College Prep Academy students are averaging two years of academic growth in one school year in English and math. The immersive experiences with college and career make the relevance of high school learning more evident to students and the rigor and ownership of what they learn are strengthened. As one of the school's students says,  ""This is a way different experience... Now I study about four to five hours a day for my high school and college classes.""
Turning to a more mature example, since 2004 Texas has supported the creation of 154 early college high schools throughout the state. One of the more notable efforts is in El Paso on the Mexican border where since 2009, over 1,100 early college graduates with associate's degrees have entered the University of Texas El Paso (UTEP) as college juniors. There are so many students accelerating to bachelor's degrees that UTEP has created special intake process and other support systems to pave the way for these young students toward future success. The early college high schools, El Paso Community College, and UTEP have clearly created a more supported, successful set of transitions for the community's young people. One student nearing graduation says, 
""...high school is a home base, and they helped me figure stuff out but also to take charge of myself. The first time, they helped us register for college classes, but after that it was, 'ok, it's how they do at college. You can do it yourself.'"" (From forthcoming report by Nancy Hoffman of JFF.)
Schools that blend college and career with high school education offer youth the chance to take ownership over their life by creating conditions that are favorable to exposure and exploration, while simultaneously offering the academic rigor, supports, and guidance necessary to make informed decisions. It is time we acknowledged that preparation for life after high school cannot happen exclusively inside the walls of high school. Exposure and experience are crucial to ensuring the appropriate type of preparation, and the timing couldn't be better for reforming the way our young people learn about themselves and shape their futures.

Little did I know they were secretly trying to identify the best candidates for the school spelling bee. Had I realized their plot, I might have flubbed my answers.",2014-05-22,EDUCATION,"I tried to ignore the crowd above me as I walked to the podium, my hands trembling fiercely. Although I knew each word the judges gave me, I don't know where I got the courage to force the letters from my mouth. I found my shield in the yellow legal pad next to the microphone, where I could write everything down before speaking. It was comforting to see what the other students had written before me, like a visitor's log for the worst tourist attraction ever. 
If I'd known being an excellent speller would turn out to be such a curse, I probably would have hidden it better.
It was clear by the time I was 7 or 8 that I was good at it. Almost freakishly good. I could read well ahead of my grade level and had a knack for remembering what words looked like. At the same time, I was severely shy, with Barbra Streisand levels of stage fright. When my teachers asked me to read aloud or answer questions in class, I was transformed into a terrified, tongue-tied dunce. 
When I could write things down, I was completely comfortable, and I aced every one of those 10-word spelling quizzes teachers like to spring on their students. Little did I know they were secretly trying to identify the best candidates for the school spelling bee. Had I realized their plot, I might have flubbed my answers. But I wasn't that savvy, and before I knew it, I was named the best speller in my class, earning me a one-way ticket to the bee. 
Like any other competition, preparing for a spelling bee involves training, but instead of stretching and laps around a racetrack, this called for thick booklets of big words most grade schoolers haven't encountered in their brief lives. For hours each day, I stared at rows of brain-scrambling words like ""sycophant,"" ""contemporaneous,"" and ""incandescence."" These are words adults have trouble spelling when they're looking right at them, let alone a nervous kid whose mouth doesn't work when she's in front of an audience. Even worse, the words are presented with no context. After an hour or so looking at them, unfamiliar terms lose any meaning they might have had. It's the printed equivalent of repeating the word ""banana"" until you're laughing at how absurd it sounds. 
I studied them anyway, hoping something would stick. I wish I'd known then what I learned in martial arts years later, that in fight-or-flight situations -- like, say, trying to spell ""mellifluous"" aloud in front of 700 people you'll have to face the next day if you fail -- our brains fall back on what's ingrained. I probably should have written each word 100 times instead. Even if it hadn't helped me remember anything, it might have taken my mind off the terror that bathed my internal organs every time I imagined the contest that lay ahead. 
The day of the bee, my fellow spellers and I sat anxiously in lines of metal folding chairs on the floor of the school auditorium, which smelled like stale cafeteria food and gym socks. Rows of students, teachers and parents loomed in the bleachers above us as we were summoned, one by one, to meet our etymological fates. 
I don't remember what I spelled or how I got through the competition, possibly due to epic amounts of dissociation. Somehow, each of my competitors was excused, until only one other student and I remained. He spelled his next word incorrectly, I spelled mine correctly, and one of the judges declared me the champion. My body flooded with relief, not because I'd won but because it was over. 
Or so I thought. Winning the school spelling bee actually meant I and my second-place counterpart went on to the regional competition. It took place in a local shopping mall, where we stood at the podium as patrons hurried past. I was eliminated early and never got that far in a spelling bee again, a fact that still fills me with more gratitude than regret.
Those contests didn't make me more comfortable in front of an audience; if anything, they cemented my desire to avoid public speaking at all costs. I chose a career in writing, in part, to continue that evasion, but it hasn't completely worked. As an author, I've read my work for bookstore audiences and been interviewed on the radio. Each time, I feel like I'm facing an oncoming freight train, but the aftermath is different now. Once the the adrenaline and nausea fade, an unexpected realization takes over: I enjoyed it. My childhood spelling bees, violin recitals and other performances were wholly unpleasant, but I now understand it's possible for public speaking to be dreadful enough to make me physically ill and, at the same time, so fun that I'm giddy by the end. What's more, I've learned that when my abilities land me in the spotlight, it's safe to shine. 
The Scripps national spelling bee finals are May 29, 2014.

287,EDUCATION,Learning From Improvement or Not,"Karin Chenoweth, ContributorWriter-in-residence at The Education Trust",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/learning-from-improvement_b_6764414.html,"When I visited it was clear that a lot of things had spurred school improvement, but it had all started with a change in leadership. This is completely in line with all the best research -- school improvement almost always starts with a new principal.",2015-02-26,EDUCATION,"Whenever I see that a low-performing school's students have improved their performance on state tests, I am curious. What happened?
That is why I was eager to visit a school that was one of the lowest performing in the state three years ago, but last year showed dramatic improvement.
Other than to say it's located in a mostly affluent exurb of a major metropolitan area, and that just about all the kids qualify for free and reduced-price meals, I'm not going to identify the school. Interspersed with a sprinkling of African American and white children, most of the school's students are from families of recent immigrants, chiefly from Central and South America. 
When I visited it was clear that a lot of things had spurred school improvement, but it had all started with a change in leadership. This is completely in line with all the best research -- school improvement almost always starts with a new principal.
The principal who took the job almost three years ago was the only person to apply for the position. In fact, some other principals in his district tried to commiserate with him, saying, ""I would never go there.""
He told me that the school he arrived in was broken in a lot of ways, with the most visible being that it was filthy. The maintenance staff, the principal said, had felt little investment in the school; their disengagement was in many ways symbolic of the entire operation, from the teachers to the kids.
When I visited recently, the building was pretty much spotless -- you could practically see your face in the shiny floors.
In all the classrooms I saw, the kids were engaged and working. When I asked any of them to tell me what they were doing I never once heard one say, ""A worksheet."" They said things like, ""I'm converting improper fractions to mixed numbers,"" or ""I'm identifying which statements are true and which are opinion."" I didn't see a single disciplinary problem; in fact only 47 kids were referred last year to the office for disciplinary problems -- down from almost 300 two years before -- and the principal said the school was on track to have even fewer this year.
The principal describes his first year as a difficult one. He had to put in place a lot of systems to support the improvement of instruction, from scheduling to budgeting to a positive behavior system, and he had to change the way a lot of things were done. One of his first acts was to require that teachers spend two days a week of their planning time in collaborative grade-level meetings. He or his assistant principal sat in -- and continue to sit in -- on every one of those meeting to ensure that teachers focused on unpacking standards, mapping out instruction, and planning lessons, assessments, and interventions. This was a change to the way the teachers had been working, and not all of them welcomed that change -- quite a few transferred to other schools.
This year the teachers themselves decided that they would meet five times a week -- in other words, teachers have made every one of their planning periods a team meeting because they have seen how they and their students benefitted from collaboration.
In terms of results on the state tests, the principal's first year was disappointing -- there was no real change in how the kids performed. But the second year saw a huge jump in proficiency rates, particularly in math. By huge jumps I mean that instead of 30 percent of students meeting math standards, 60 or 70 percent did, depending on the grade level. In one classroom every single student was proficient, including the students with learning disabilities.
The school still has a ways to go. But teachers are focused on instruction and bring a sense of urgency to their collaboration meetings and their classrooms, a sense that is matched by the enthusiasm of the students.
Because of the school's dramatic improvement, some area teachers and administrators ask to visit so that they can understand what the school is doing. To my mind, those educators represent the hopes of the field. They want to see for themselves the kinds of things that make a difference, presumably with the idea that they have something to learn from the success of their colleagues.
But the reaction of other educators represents one of the reasons it is so hard for education to improve. For example, fellow principals have directly asked the principal how he managed to game the system to get improved test results. When his teachers go to district meetings they are being treated as pariahs by their colleagues. ""They get all these remarks designed to bring them down and make them feel as if they are doing something wrong,"" the principal said. Instead of being asked how they achieved the kind of growth they achieved, they are isolated.
I'm not sure why that happens, but I think some educators have firmly internalized the belief that children from low-income families and children of color can't achieve at high levels. They so accept the inevitability of failure that they would rather believe that high-performing high-poverty schools are cheating than make the effort to figure out what helps them succeed. 
""Nobody expects our kids to do it,"" is the way the principal put it.
I have talked with enough educators from high-performing high-poverty schools to know that he is not describing an isolated phenomenon. Instead of being consulted for their knowledge and expertise, educators in high-performing and rapidly improving schools are often subject to suspicion and accusations.
I am not arguing against skepticism. All proclamations of success should be greeted with healthy skepticism. But sometimes success is actually solid, built on research-based practices and the craft knowledge of expert educators.
If the field of education is to move forward, it needs to identify and learn from those successes.

The FAFSA is used by colleges and universities to determine eligibility for student aid.,2015-06-30,EDUCATION,"The Free Application for Federal Student Aid or FAFSA is available to anyone who is considering graduate or undergraduate studies in the United States. The FAFSA is used by colleges and universities to determine eligibility for student aid.
What Is The FAFSA?
The FAFSA is a free online form that gives applicants access to grants, loans, and work study funds from the federal government. Also, colleges and universities use the FAFSA to make decisions about student financial aid requests.
When Must I Complete The FAFSA?
The FAFSA must be completed before you enter your first year of schooling and each year thereafter. The reason it must be filed every year is because your financial situation may change from year to year.
Do I Have To Provide Income Tax Information On The FASFA?
Some US Federal Income Tax information is required to complete the FAFSA. This information can be accessed automatically through the IRS. Estimated tax numbers can be entered if your taxes haven’t been filed yet.
When Is The FAFSA Filing Deadline?
There is no universal deadline for filing. Instead, each academic institution sets up its own filling calendar. The best advice is to file the FAFSA as early as possible. This is especially important since some funds are available on a first-come first-serve basis. The earliest you can apply is on January 1 for any given school year.
How Much Student Aid Will I Get For Filling Out The FAFSA?
Each school has its own formula for determining financial need. The calculation is made by taking the total cost of education minus the amount your family can pay towards education (Estimated Family Contribution or EFC). Wages and other sources of income are taken into account when calculating the EFC.
What Sources Of Student Aid Require The FAFSA?
All sources of federal student aid require that you submit the FAFSA. State student aid providers also use the application. Private scholarships and lenders also typically require information found on the FAFSA.
Where Do I Get The Forms To Fill Out The FAFSA?
You can fill out the application online or use a paper form.
What Are The Eligibility Requirements?
Nearly anybody can apply for student aid. The amount of aid you receive depends on the available funds and your need. According to the Office of the US Department of Education, to be eligible you must:
 Be a citizen or eligible noncitizen of the United States. Have a valid Social Security Number. Have a high school diploma or a General Education Development (GED) certificate, or have completed homeschooling. If you don’t, you may still be eligible for federal student aid if you were enrolled in college or career school prior to July 1, 2012. Be enrolled in an eligible program as a regular student seeking a degree or certificate. Maintain satisfactory academic progress. Not owe a refund on a federal student grant or be in default on a federal student loan. Register (or already be registered) with the Selective Service System, if you are a male and not currently on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces. Not have a conviction for the possession or sale of illegal drugs for an offense that occurred while you were receiving federal student aid (such as grants, work-study, or loans). If you have such a conviction, you must complete the Student Aid Eligibility Worksheet to determine if you are eligible for aid or partially eligible for aid.

C. M. Rubin's global education report from Canada, China, the US and the UK.
In December, I continued my conversations with world leaders on the frontiers of education reform. These leaders (from Canada, China, America and the UK) all share a commitment to transforming education at the ground level, so that the poorest and most disadvantaged schools can become sites for development of innovative education and can create smart and employable future citizens. 
From Canada, I talked to Mary Jean Gallagher, (Chief Student Achievement Officer of Ontario and Assistant Deputy Minister of the Student Achievement Division of the Ontario Ministry of Education) about the extensive educational turnaround in Ontario. The statistics are proof of the significant success. For instance, over the past decade, the percentage of students meeting provincial standards in the annual literacy and numeracy tests for grades three and six has risen from 54 percent to 71 percent, and the high school graduation rate has increased from 68 percent to 83 percent. Gallagher explains that this was caused by offering support at multiple levels of the system: ""Support is provided in the form of advice, shared research into effective practices, opportunities for exchanging insights among peers, and the funding per school ($15,000) for release time out of the normal work schedule for planning, monitoring, reflecting on and integrating what is being learned into classroom practice.""
From China, I talked to Jiang Xueqin (deputy principal of highly regarded Tsinghua University High School) about how to offer progressive education in a nation where the gap between rich and poor is immense. This requires creating programs early on for the disadvantaged children in China, investing in vocational programs, and building a national system of community colleges. He also spoke of his teaching philosophy: ""It requires tremendous emotional intelligence, self-understanding, wisdom, maturity, and confidence to maintain a minimal interventionist attitude while offering non-judgmental support and encouragement. Teachers and students are the real stars of any great school, and real education leadership means playing a backstage and supporting role."" 
From the United States, I talked to Harvard professor Howard Gardner about how his innovative concept, Good Grit, meaning the combination of character and drive, can be applied to education systems across the globe. Gardner was joined by Jeffrey Beard from the UK (former Director General of the International Baccalaureate Organization, now Founder and Chairman of Global Study Pass). Gardner and Beard show that Good Grit is a breakthrough concept in education reform and can pave the way for students to do better in the increasingly competitive global marketplace. Moreover, Gardner and Beard suggest that Good Grit will lead to a more collaborative and ethical future. 
In the words of Gardner, ""If you simply want to have the most toys at the end of life, you might get away with Bad or Compromised Grit. But if you pursue goals beyond self-aggrandizement, then you can do well both for yourself and for the world. And even if you don't aim to change the world, being truthful and trustworthy serve you well in every marketplace.""
Finally, I want to take this opportunity to wish a very happy new year to all our contributors and followers around the world. May we never stop learning and growing from these global conversations we so enjoy.

Teachers Find New Science Standards Fun, But Costly","EdSource, ContributorNonprofit news site focused on education policy and its effects",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fizz-pop-bang-teachers-find-new-science-standards_us_5a1c7850e4b05d1c376aceca,"By Carolyn Jones With their emphasis on hands-on experiments, California’s new science standards have turned classrooms into",2017-11-27,EDUCATION,"By Carolyn Jones
With their emphasis on hands-on experiments, California’s new science standards have turned classrooms into noisy, messy laboratories.
That’s been popular with students and teachers who say it’s a more effective way to learn science than studying textbooks and memorizing facts, but the cost of all those underwater robots and exploding chemicals has left some teachers wondering how they can successfully implement the standards with ever-restricting budgets.
“I love the new standards, I really do. But it’s so expensive, I just don’t see how it’s going to happen,” said Laura Ruiz, a science teacher at Hollenbeck Middle School in Los Angeles Unified. “All of us teachers are spending hundreds of dollars a year of our own money to purchase supplies. Is there a cheap way to teach these standards? I’m trying to find one, but I just don’t think so.”
The new K-12 standards, called the Next Generation Science Standards, were approved by the California State Board of Education in 2013 and are gradually rolling out in districts across the state. All schools are expected to have fully implemented the new standards by spring 2019, when the state gives its first official assessments.
Hundreds of schools have already switched to the new standards, which are intended to give students a deeper understanding of scientific concepts by conducting as many as three or four science experiments a week.
But even the simplest science experiments cost money. Vinegar and baking soda for 150 middle-schoolers to make their own volcanoes costs at least $50. For a lesson on thermal energy, calcium chloride, ammonium nitrate and plastic baggies for 150 students to make their own hand-warmers can cost at least $65.
At the California Science Teachers Association conference in October, dozens of companies filled the exhibition hall hawking their Next Generation-aligned science gizmos, ranging from plastic atom models to $5,200 robotics kits.
But most of those gadgets are out of the question for teachers like Ruiz, who has a $200 annual budget for science supplies. She tries to give her students one hands-on project a week, which means she must be creative.
She’ll try to stretch out a project over several days or weeks, having the students try different variations of the same scientific principle. Or she’ll apply for grants to fund specific projects, although grant applications can take hours to complete, take months to come through and sometimes don’t result in funding at all.
Asking students to bring supplies from home or ask for money from their parents is also an option, although not ideal because 95 percent of her students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. Still, the students sell chocolate bars every year to raise money to attend an overnight science camp.
Elizabeth Walsh, a science education professor at San Jose State University, said Ruiz’s experience is not unusual. The new science standards may be popular, but they’ve been easier for wealthy districts to implement than those with less money, she said.
“You don’t need a $3,000 piece of fancy equipment to teach Next Generation Science Standards, but you do need the basics,” she said. “You need a working Wi-Fi connection. You need beakers. You need measuring equipment. You want your students to participate in real science, like real scientists do, and that costs money.”
In general, districts with more resources can invest in higher-quality science materials, and districts with less money are forced to shift the cost onto teachers and students, she said. The result is that lower-income students might not receive the full benefit of the Next Generation Science Standards — an unfortunate irony, Walsh said, because the standards are intended to promote science among students who are under-represented in the field.
“That kind of inequity has been a reality in our educational system for a long time, and will continue to be until the funding mechanisms change,”she said. “The fact is, some teachers are getting thousands to buy Next Generation materials and some haven’t even been trained in the standards yet. It’s an equity issue.”
Dozens of grants are available for science teachers, ranging from pet store coupons to fund a classroom pet, to $5,000 from Toshiba for hands-on engineering projects.
Some teachers have been turning to a nonprofit website called DonorsChoose.org, where teachers describe the project they hope to fund, post pictures of their students, delineate the costs and hope the public donates.
Founded in 2003, the website has helped raise more than $600 million for U.S. classrooms and served nearly 400,000 teachers. Since the Next Generation Science Standards were introduced nationally in 2011, the amount of annual donations has more than tripled, from $34 million that year to $113 million in 2016, in part due to school budget cuts and a rush of science teachers asking for donations, said DonorsChoose.org vice president Chris Pearsall.
“If we weren’t here, many of these teachers would be spending that money out of their own pockets,” he said. “The teachers we hear from say they’re not going to let funding challenges stop them from helping their students. … We hope we can lighten the burden for teachers.”
At a high school in Carson, near Los Angeles, a teacher was asking for $198 for paper and markers so he could teach his students graphing. In San Pablo, in the Bay Area, an elementary teacher was asking for $195 for owl pellets and a magnetic easel for a life science lesson. An elementary teacher in Fresno was asking for $168 for blocks and a microscope.
About 75 percent of the projects listed on DonorsChoose.org get funded, Pearsall said, either though individual donations or by foundations.
Among the best-selling materials for the Next Generation Science Standards are FOSS kits, which are boxes of scales, thermometers, funnels, silkworm eggs, globes and other materials for K-8 science experiments. FOSS, which stands for Full Option Science System, is used by 20,000 schools and districts, including Los Angeles Unified and the New York City public schools.
But FOSS kits are not inexpensive. To outfit a 5th-grade classroom with the full set of three kits — “Mixtures and Solutions,” “Earth and Sun” and “Living Systems” — would cost $4,500. But the kits provide materials for two or three science experiments a week for a school year, and the materials are designed to last nine years, said Mariel Warnock, senior campaign manager at Delta Education, the company that produces FOSS kits.
To pay for the kits, some schools turn to DonorsChoose.org, fundraise or apply for grants, she said. Some states use the federal money from their Every Student Succeeds Act allotments. And Delta Education works with districts to find affordable options, she said.
At Yuba Environmental Science Charter Academy, a K-8 school in rural Yuba County, middle school science teacher Deborah Burdette has become a master at applying for grants. After years of spending hundreds of dollars a year out-of-pocket on supplies, she now collects thousands in grants from corporations and education foundations.
“It takes a lot of time and sometimes you have to apply months in advance, but when they come through it’s pretty cool,” she said. With one of her grants, she purchased garden supplies, allowing her students to study soil, water cycles, decomposition, food supplies and other topics that are part of the Next Generation Science Standards.
With an annual supply budget of $250, she’s also become an expert in low-cost science experiments. Among her students’ favorite projects: spinning spider webs out of dental floss, building paper chairs that can hold a stuffed animal, testing humidity with glass jars and making weather gauges out of thermometers and empty milk cartons.
“I go to the dollar store a lot. The dollar store is my friend,” she said. “For a classroom teacher it can be hard to find the time for all this. You have to be creative.”

291,EDUCATION,An Open Letter to the Secretary of Education Designate from Thousands of American Clergy,"Michael Zimmerman, Ph.D., ContributorFounder, The Clergy Letter Project",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-open-letter-to-the-sec_b_13538890.html,,2016-12-10,EDUCATION,"Dear Ms. DeVos,
 Congratulations on your appointment as the Secretary Designate for the Department of Education. The job represents a huge responsibility to America's children and, therefore, to the future of our country. We are well aware of your long-standing interest in education and wish you the very best as you embark on this administrative journey. It is in all of our best interests for you to succeed spectacularly in your new job.
 Without intending to be overly presumptuous, we're writing to ask you to consider a number of points of concern. We're taking this step because, like you, we care deeply about the quality of education in our country and because, like you, we care deeply about the role religion can and should play in our pluralistic society.
 Before getting down to specifics, let us introduce ourselves. Over 14,000 strong, we represent American clergy. We have come together to form The Clergy Letter Project to promote the teaching of the best science education society can offer. We are resolute in our belief that religion has nothing to fear from science and, therefore, that religious doctrine should not attempt to limit the scientific principles to which our children are exposed. 
 Needless to say, as clergy we are all profoundly religious. But beyond that common thread, we are a very heterogeneous group. We represent many religions and denominations. Some of us are liberal while others are conservative. Some have recently been ordained while others have been serving for well over 50 years. Some of us work in the country's largest houses of worship while others serve small, rural congregations. We are women and men from all races and ethnicities. 
 Our concerns center on on three related topics. First, as a private citizen you have stated that your work on education reform was designed to ""advance God's Kingdom."" While we applaud your commitment as a private citizen, as the Secretary of Education we urge you to recognize that such a goal is inappropriate. The decisions you make and the initiatives the Department of Education undertake need to be in the best interest of all American citizens. Promoting one religious perspective leaves many of us on the outside. Indeed, having an arm of the federal government promoting ANY religious perspective leaves many Americans on the outside. Our commitment to our religious faith requires that we ask you to set aside your individual beliefs and think more broadly about the good of our country.
 Second, you have been a major supporter of school ""choice."" While we do not have a collective opinion about this issue, we have been very troubled that many ""alternative"" schools have an abysmal record when it comes to teaching modern science. Many such schools have adopted science texts that have no basis in science and instead are promoting very narrow religious views in the name of science. We believe that it is inappropriate to be spending tax dollars on such materials and, more importantly, we know that such materials are doing a disservice to the students who are forced to use them. We urge you to do everything you can to ensure that all American students, regardless of which school they attend, receive the very best education possible. We ask that you not permit tax dollars to be used to subvert the teaching of modern science.
 Third, we note that you will be entering an administration that, in large part, has made it clear that it has little regard for scientific expertise. From evolution to climate change, the administration's position is diametrically opposed to the worldwide scientific consensus. We urge you to be a voice of reason in the midst of this collective negativity. We fear for the future of our country, for the possibility of future innovation arising from our children's generation, if they are taught to disregard all expertise. While we believe it is good and wise to teach children to ask questions, it is anti-intellectual to teach them to do so mindlessly. Children must learn the difference between facts and opinion, and they must learn to deal with even those facts which make them uncomfortable. As the Secretary of Education, you have the opportunity to educate the rest of the administration about the power of education. We hope you embrace this opportunity fully because it may, in fact, be the most critical aspect of your job.
 Thank you for taking the time to read this note. As we said at the outset, we wish you nothing but the best as you step into your new role. 
 Sincerely,
 Clergy Members of The Clergy Letter Project

292,EDUCATION,"Vergara Identified A Few Real Problems, But It's Completely Wrong About The Solutions","Ben Spielberg, Contributor34Justice co-founder and blogger",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vergara-education-schools_b_5493503.html,Judge Treu's opinion unfortunately reflects a misunderstanding of education research and teacher employment law's effects. His decision also erodes labor protections without increasing the likelihood of an excellent education for students in low-income communities.,2014-06-13,EDUCATION,"Judge Rolf Treu ruled in favor of Students Matter in Vergara v. California, deeming teacher permanent status (commonly called ""tenure""), due process protections for teachers with permanent status, and seniority-based layoffs unconstitutional. Treu's opinion unfortunately reflects a misunderstanding of education research and teacher employment law's effects. His decision also erodes labor protections without increasing the likelihood of an excellent education for students in low-income communities.
Reformer excitement about the ruling demonstrates how successfully the plaintiffs have conflated teacher employment law with the existence of ineffective teachers. Informed advocates for low-income students and communities, on the other hand, are deeply disappointed because both ethical considerations and a thorough analysis of the case indicate the error in Treu's findings.
The California Teachers Association (CTA) plans to appeal the decision and higher courts will hopefully see through the plaintiffs' weak case. No matter the appeal's outcome, Treu's opinion raises two issues considerably more significant for low-income students than teacher dismissal and layoff procedures: 
1) Teacher evaluation and support practices: Treu wrote that 18+ months of employment is not ""nearly enough time for an informed decision to be made regarding the decision of tenure,"" arguing that administrator fear of permanent status deprives ""teachers of an adequate opportunity to establish their competence."" He wants ""to have the tenure decision made after"" California teachers finish BTSA, an induction program teachers must complete to clear their credentials, and he suggests a timeline of three to five years.
Treu is correct that some ineffective teachers are currently retained and some good teachers are currently dismissed under California's system, but he's wrong about the primary reason why. Instead, inadequate approaches to teacher evaluation and a lack of quality teacher support have long hindered the development and retention of excellent teachers. Nearly two years is far longer than a supervisor should need to evaluate teacher performance and potential for growth if evaluation systems provide frequent opportunities for meaningful feedback and support about specific teacher practices. 
Unions and many reform organizations actually agree about the goals of teacher evaluation. The New Teacher Project (TNTP), for example, believes that ""the core purpose of evaluation must be maximizing teacher growth and effectiveness, not just documenting poor performance as a prelude to dismissal."" Similarly, CTA believes that ""the purpose of an effective teacher development and evaluation system is to inform, instruct and improve teaching and learning; to provide educators with meaningful feedback on areas of strength and where improvement is needed; and to ensure fair and evidence-based employment decisions."" Though reformer support for the use of standardized test score results as a percentage of teacher evaluations may decrease teaching quality and detract from student learning, TNTP and CTA also agree about many areas in which evaluation practices need improvement: the training administrators receive on how to give meaningful feedback, the quality of professional growth plans and professional development opportunities, and the frequency and length of classroom observations.
Extending new teachers' probationary periods indefinitely will not address the underlying causes of the problem Treu identifies. In fact, the argument that two years isn't ""nearly enough time"" implicitly grants license for administrative incompetence and practices that inadequately address new teachers' professional needs. Education stakeholders committed to developing and identifying great new teachers should instead pour their time, money, and energy into aligning evaluation and support systems with their goals. San Jose Unified School District (SJUSD) and the San Jose Teachers Association (SJTA), for example, have invested in administrator training, evaluative consulting teachers with content-area teaching expertise, evaluation documents that more accurately define effective teaching and require narrative feedback, a Teacher Quality Panel consisting of both teacher and administrator members, and non-evaluative instructional coaching support.
2) School funding: Treu's ruling erroneously considers Vergara v. California part of a historical record of education-related court cases including Brown v. Board of Education, Serrano v. Priest, and Butt v. California. These three cases, unlike Vergara, dealt with undebatable and direct inequities in access to educational opportunity for low-income and minority students: segregated schools (Brown), inequitable access to school funding (Serrano), and inequitable access to a full school year (Butt). Treu fails to note that, despite the Serrano case and the advent of California's new Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), major inequities in education funding persist in California today.
In 2012-2013, for example, SJUSD received approximately $9,000 per pupil in revenue. During the same year, Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD) received about 60% more money per pupil, approximately $14,500. While California guarantees a certain amount of annual funding called a ""revenue limit"" to every school district in the state, some districts, like PAUSD, bring in property tax revenues that exceed the revenue limit. These ""basic aid"" districts keep their excess property tax revenue and often pass parcel taxes that further increase the funding discrepancy between lower-income districts and their higher-income basic aid counterparts.
More funding is not a panacea for low-income schools - how districts spend their money determines its return -- but research is clear that funding matters a great deal. Politicians who cut education-related spending for poor communities often cite a 33-year-old study by Eric Hanushek to oppose equitable school funding, yet even Hanushek himself cautiously supports it. Asked in a 2006 interview if ""it's a good idea to give very high-poverty districts more funding per pupil than an average district,"" Hanushek responded: ""I think so. I think you have to provide extra resources and help for kids who start at a lower point because of their backgrounds."" It's impossible to support educational equity and justify the funding discrepancy between SJUSD and PAUSD.
One of the most important provisions of the LCFF -- the supplemental funding it provides to districts that serve high numbers of English language learners, students from low-income families, and students from foster homes -- moves California in the right direction. However, basic aid districts that have long been able to afford better resources for students will continue to exist. Based on the case history Treu cites, one could construct a very strong case that the existence of basic aid districts violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the California Constitution. Advocates for low-income students could also make an indirect equal protection case about Proposition 13's effect on school funding disparities. Unlike Vergara v. California, these cases could continue the tradition of Brown, Serrano, and Butt by remedying a clear instance of educational inequity.
Treu's ruling also invites an analysis of the definition of appropriate due process. The judge asserts that ""[t]here is no question that teachers should be afforded reasonable due process when their dismissals are sought,"" but he claims that current protections for teachers with permanent status constitute ""uber due process."" Treu proposes replacing teacher dismissal law with the rights guaranteed by the decision in Skelly v. State Personnel Board; because of Skelly, permanent employees facing dismissal must receive ""notice of the proposed action, the reasons therefor, a copy of the charges and materials upon which the action is based, and the right to respond, either orally or in writing, to the authority initially imposing discipline."" 
In essence, Skelly rights ensure that employers treat permanent employees with some semblance of courtesy and respect. While Treu asserts that due process considerations are ""entirely legitimate,"" however, he forgets to mention that probationary teachers do not have Skelly rights; in California, probationary teachers can be non-reelected (fired) without cause. Treu's argument is completely contradictory given current law -- he simultaneously contends that he believes in the concept of due process and that districts should be able to deprive people of it for three to five years.
Labor organizations support Skelly's basic protections for all employees because of the extensive history of inappropriate employer practices and a belief in treating people fairly. Due process protections should also include a requirement that administrators adequately support permanent teachers before attempting to dismiss them. A support-first mindset is not only the most ethical approach, but it's also important because, as Jack Schneider explains, ""you don't put... effective teacher[s] in every classroom by holding... sword[s] over their heads. You do it by putting tools in their hands."" Advocates for workers rights support streamlined dismissal processes for employees who are unwilling or unable to improve; the defendants in Vergara just know that society and schools benefit when employers are required to treat their employees like human beings.
Judge Treu accurately identifies a few key issues in his decision: administrators may struggle to identify quality teaching in fewer than two years, layoffs may deprive schools and students of stellar teachers, and teacher employment law may fail to grant teachers an appropriate amount of due process. Unfortunately, Vergara v. California neither improves teacher evaluation and support practices nor rectifies the funding inequities that lead to layoffs and resource cutbacks in districts that serve low-income students. The decision also ignores the complete lack of due process afforded to probationary teachers and fails to deliver a thoughtful recommendation about how to empower teachers to grow professionally. Informed, honest student advocates who care more about ""providing each child... with a basically equal opportunity to receive a quality education"" than about destroying organized labor should therefore hope that an appeals court will reverse Treu's decision. In the meantime, they should begin work on reforms more likely to improve opportunities for low-income students.

293,EDUCATION,Tuning in to Teachers,"Randi Weingarten, ContributorPresident, American Federation of Teachers",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tuning-in-to-teachers_b_5603784.html,"Why would 3,500 people go to sun- and fun-filled Los Angeles and opt to spend the bulk of their time inside a cavernous convention hall? To be heard.",2014-07-20,EDUCATION,"Why would 3,500 people go to sun- and fun-filled Los Angeles and opt to spend the bulk of their time inside a cavernous convention hall? To be heard. This was the case last week at the American Federation of Teachers biennial convention, where educators spoke up forcefully and passionately about economic and social justice, education and professional issues on which they are often denied a voice.  These days, the wisdom and experience of educators are often ignored and, worse, dismissed by policymakers who favor approaches emanating far from the classroom. Yet no one is better able to weigh in on what will help children succeed academically than educators, who have incomparable firsthand knowledge. That's exactly what AFT delegates did--setting union policies for how to reclaim the promise of public education--for our kids, families and communities.  AFT's new policy revamping accountability is perhaps the most important because it confronts the destructive obsession with standardized testing. 
Educators didn't simply rail against the harmful effects of ""test-and-punish"" accountability systems driven by No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top; they gave near-unanimous approval to a new approach aimed at ensuring kids have meaningful learning outcomes--based on a systemic support-and-improve model that holds to account all who have responsibility for education.
The most intense debate concerned the Common Core State Standards. Teachers have been told that these are an essential building block to help all students be ready for college and career, yet stories of inadequate resources and preparation for teachers and students were as legion as they were heartbreaking. The anger over the emphasis on testing and the profit-seeking developers of tests and textbooks as well as other ""edupreneurs"" was evident and justified.
That's why some who object to the standards believe that they are being used to set up public education, kids and teachers for failure. Even with all of this, supporters said the standards--when properly resourced and supported--develop deeper learning, and help disrupt educational inequities by making essential skills and knowledge available to all children.
The passionate debate ended with two-thirds of the delegates in support of the standards' potential, but calling for teachers and parents to have real input in their implementation; for officials to be held accountable for proper implementation; and reaffirming the call the AFT started in April 2013 for a moratorium on the high-stakes consequences of Common Core-aligned assessments until the new accountability system envisioned here is in place. Officials who say they believe in the Common Core should heed these commonsense actions.
These debates about accountability and standards show why the California judge who recently stripped teachers' due-process rights was so wrong. Educators not only should be heard on the floor of a convention, they also need their voices to be respected in their schools and by policymakers. 
AFT delegates strongly stated that due process is not a shield to cloak incompetence, nor an excuse for managers not to manage. When I addressed the convention and said that no teacher wants to work alongside someone not cut out for this demanding profession, it was met with applause.
Due process gives teachers professional latitude, such as to use scenes from the movie ""Mean Girls"" to help teach the power dynamics of ""Julius Caesar,"" as one teacher has. It enables educators to fight for their students' needs. It protects people such as the former Teacher of the Year who was told to remain silent about her sexual orientation until she had tenure, and the teacher parents sought to remove from the classroom for teaching the California state curriculum on Islam. It's necessary to prevent reverting to a patronage system so that teachers' jobs do not depend on whom they know, but what they know.
Finally, it was no surprise to me that Secretary of Education Arne Duncan was criticized for ""misguided and ineffective policies on deprofessionalization, privatization and test obsession."" Those policies have created a toxic climate for schools, kids, educators, parents and communities; but because we value both the potential to improve and due process, delegates called for Duncan to be placed on a ""secretary improvement plan."" If he does not improve, they resolved, ""he must resign."" 
Too often education edicts come down from on high with a directive to ""just do it,"" without question and without complaint. Educators' voices should be as welcome in the halls of power as they were in the halls of our convention. That is the lesson Secretary Duncan and others must learn if the goal truly is to strengthen America's public schools.

294,EDUCATION,'The Moment Gratitude Changed My Perspective In The Classroom',"Owen Griffith, ContributorTeacher and Author, 'Gratitude: A Way of Teaching'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-moment-gratitude-chan_b_7215872.html,"I have experienced many moments of gratitude that have changed my life. Yet as I reflect on these moments, one stands out: a moment in the classroom that changed the way I look at my ""problems.""",2015-05-05,EDUCATION,"I have experienced many moments of gratitude that have changed my life. Yet as I reflect on these moments, one stands out: a moment in the classroom that changed the way I look at my ""problems.""
I am a teacher and I have had the tremendous pleasure of teaching for ten years. Early on in my career, I had one student that challenged me and presented a ""problem"" in an interesting manner. This student would watch as I wrote on the whiteboard and raise her hand with a little smile on her face. When I called on her, she would correct me saying things like, ""Mr. Griffith, you spelled 'millennium' wrong."" On that particular day, I was tired and frustrated, and I did not take this statement very well. In fact, you might say I was ""ungrateful"" that morning for the student noticing my mistake.
On my first break, I stormed into the teachers' lunch room and saw a trusted colleague. I told her what had happened and said that this student was being very disrespectful for pointing this out in front of the class. I said that this problem was ruining my day.
She smiled knowingly, as good friends do at these moments, looked at me and said, ""That is one of those situations that you can complain about and build up a resentment or you could change it into something positive. That student had to be paying close attention to find the errors you make. You might think about giving students a reward for finding the errors. Then, if you make an error, you can tell them you were just testing them."" We both smiled and my resentment started to soften. My friend went on, ""You just started doing a gratitude list with your students. Maybe that student should be at the top of your gratitude list because she is teaching you to turn problems into solutions.""
This startled me. I thought this conversation would go a different direction with some commiserating on our problems in the classroom. But this shock melted into a new way to look at this situation and to appreciate this student with gratitude. I realized that any time I am challenged in life, I do have an opportunity to turn around the situation by applying some gratitude and creativity. 
I remembered that the Chinese symbol that represents crisis is a combination of danger and opportunity. If I focus on the opportunity, I will see something good that can come out of any ""crisis.""
After lunch, I went back to my classroom and told the students that every day, I would be hiding at least one mistake on the board for them to find, making it a game. If a student found a mistake, they would get a little reward and could make a suggestion for an error for the next day. 
Immediately, all the students starting paying closer attention to everything I wrote. They started noticing when I purposely wrote something wrong on the board, like a misspelled word or a grammar or punctuation error. 
At the end of the school year, when this class took a standardized test, the scores for editing and correcting punctuation and grammar were through the roof. That one student, who started this entire change in perspective, scored at the college level in this area, and this was for a 4 grade student. I realized that I could have squashed her talent, but a friend offered the perspective of gratitude and that turned this into a moment we all learned from and enjoyed.
The following year, I had a student who had a wonderful and mischievous sense of humor. This student had a reputation for being a real disruption to classes with his ""inappropriate humor."" At the beginning of the school year, he tried to disrupt my class by blurting out something that got the entire class laughing but also got us all way off track. Instantly, I thought back to the moment with the other student and tried to think how this challenge and potential year-long battle could be turned into something positive.
Looking through the lens of gratitude, I saw this boy was funny yet he felt like he needed attention. So I told him, ""If you can stay quiet all day, I will give you 2 minutes at the end of the day to do a comedy routine."" He got excited. He asked if he could work up a 5-minute routine and perform on Friday afternoon, so we would all have something to look forward to. 
I agreed and never had a problem with him for the rest of the school year. Friday afternoon comedy routines became something we all looked forward to. He did one routine on the spelling bee and another on cafeteria food. Both were hilarious and stayed within the boundaries of what was appropriate. As I keep these moments of gratitude fresh in my mind, I create a joy that changes those insurmountable problems into challenges that help me grow.

295,EDUCATION,Dear Teachers: Don’t Be Good Soldiers For The EdTech Industry,"Steven Singer, ContributorHusband, father, teacher, education advocate",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dear-teachers-dont-be-good-soldiers-for-the-edtech_us_59b83e92e4b06b71800c3528,There is a force out there that’s working to destroy our profession.,2017-09-12,EDUCATION,"Dear fellow teachers,
Thank you for coming to this meeting on such short notice.
I know you have plenty more important matters to attend to this morning. I, myself, left a pile of ungraded papers on my desk so I could get here. Not to mention I urgently need to fix my seating charts now that I’ve finally met my students and know who can sit with whom. And I’ve got to track down phone numbers for my kids’ parents and go through a mountain of Individual Education Plans, and… well, I just want you to know that I get it.
There are a lot of seemingly more pressing concerns than listening to a teacher-blogger jabber about the intersection of politics and our profession.
Is that all of us? Okay, would someone please close the door?
Good. No administrators in here, right? Just classroom teachers? Excellent.
Let’s speak openly. There’s something very important we need to talk about.
There is a force out there that’s working to destroy our profession.
Yes, ANOTHER one!
We’ve got lawmakers beholden to the corporate education reform industry on the right and media pundits spewing Wall Street propaganda on the left. The last thing we need is yet another group dedicated to tearing down our public schools.
But there is. And it is us.
You heard me right.
It’s us.
There is an entire parasitic industry making billions of dollars selling us things we don’t need – standardized tests, Common Core workbook drivel, software test prep THIS, and computer test crap THAT.
We didn’t decide to use it. We didn’t buy it. But who is it who actually introduces most of this garbage in the classroom?
That’s right. US.
We do it. Often willingly.
We need to stop.
And before someone calls me a luddite, let me explain. I’m not saying technology is bad. It’s a tool like anything else. There are plenty of ways to use it to advance student learning. But the things we’re being asked to do… You know in your heart that they aren’t in the best interests of children.
I know. Some of you have no choice. You live in a state or district where teacher autonomy is a pathetic joke. There are ways to fight that, but they’re probably not in the classroom.
It’s not you who I’m talking to. I’m addressing everyone else. I’m talking to all the teachers out there who DO have some modicum of control over their own classrooms and who are told by their administrators to do things that they honestly disagree with – but they do it anyway.
We’ve got to stop doing it.
Corporations want to replace us with software packages. They want to create a world where kids sit in front of computers or iPads or some other devices for hours at a time doing endless test prep. You know it’s true because your administrator probably is telling you to proctor such rubbish in your own classroom so many hours a week. I know MINE is.
Listen, there are several reasons why we should refuse.
First, there’s simple job security. If your principal brought in a Teach for America temp and told you this lightly trained fresh from college kid was going to take over your classes, would you really sit down and instruct her how to do your job!?
I wouldn’t.
That’s the entire point behind this tech industry garbage. You are piloting a program that means your own redundancy.
You are engaged in an effort to prove that they don’t need a fully trained, experienced, four-year degree professional to do this job. They just need a glorified WalMart greeter to watch the kids as they push buttons and stare at a screen. They just need a minimum wage drone to take up space while the children bask in the warm glow of the program, while it maps their eye movements, catalogues how long it takes them to answer, records their commercial preferences and sells all this data to other companies so they can better market products – educational and otherwise – back to these kids, their school and their parents.
This isn’t about improving educational outcomes. It’s about bringing the cost down and pocketing the savings as profit.
It’s about replacing the end-of-the-year standardized test with daily mini stealth assessments that are just as high stakes and just as effective at providing an excuse for the state or the feds to swoop in and steal control, disband the school board and give the whole shebang to the charter school operator who gives them the most generous campaign donations.
Do NOT be a good soldier here. Do not just follow orders. Doing so is weakening our entire profession. It is putting our jobs in jeopardy. And it’s about time our national teachers unions figured this out instead of conceding the point so their leaders can keep a seat at the table. Someone needs to tell them they shouldn’t be sitting inside the building. They should be with us, outside surrounding it with signs and pitchforks.
The EdTech shell game is not about improving student learning. It’s a commercial coup, not a progressive renaissance.
Think about it.
They call this trash “personalized learning.” How can it really be personalized if kids do the same exercises just at different rates? How is it personalized if it’s standardized? How is it personalized if it omits the presence of actual people in the education process?
It’s teach-by-numbers, correspondence school guano with graphics and a high speed Internet connection.
But we give in. We don’t want to rock the boat. We’re rule followers, most of us. We do what we’re told.
Most teachers were good students, and obedience is too often a defining quality of those who succeed in our education system.
I get it. You don’t want to be a fly in the ointment. You don’t want to make yourself a target.
Me, too.
How dearly I would love to be able to just comply. But I can’t simply go along with something I know in my heart to be wrong. And this is wrong on so many levels.
I sat through a meeting much like this one earlier this year where I was told exactly which programs to force on my students. All the while good teachers whom I respect went through the motions as if nothing was wrong. They talked about how to organize our classes in the system, how to assign test prep and how often, and how to access the data.
But we never discussed why.
We never discussed if doing so was a good idea. That was all taken for granted. It was a decision reserved for someone else, someone from a higher pay grade.
Yet classroom experience is rarely commensurate with salary scale especially once you cross the line into management. Nor is the experience of a handful of administrators equal to that of a plentitude of staff!
No. I’m sorry. At very least that is a discussion WE should be having.
It is the TEACHER’S job to determine what is educationally appropriate. Not the administrators. At most, the building principal should be part of that discussion in her role as lead teacher. But the resolution to go ahead or not should be made together as a staff.
And if an individual teacher thinks based on their own experience with their own students that they should go in a different direction, they should be respected enough as a professional to have the autonomy to do so.
Teachers have to abide by best practices, but test prep in any form is NOT a best practice.
It’s time we stood up en masse and made that clear.
We are our own worst enemy in this regard.
We are too submissive. Too meek.
This world requires teachers to be revolutionaries, to be radicals.
And that doesn’t end in the classroom.
We need to educate parents and the community about what’s happening. The classroom doors are too often closed to the public. The only information they get is from anemic administrators and a mass media that invariably just reports whatever propaganda the corporation puts on the press releases.
We are responsible for our students. We must protect them from the vultures out there trying to water down their educations and reduce the quality of their learning.
We are not the only ones who can take a stand. In fact, IF we are the only ones who do it, we will certainly fail.
But, along with parents, students and concerned citizens, we MUST be part of that resistance.
We MUST take a stand for our children and our profession.
Because without us, there is no hope of success.
So we can no longer afford to be good soldiers in someone else’s army.
It’s time to have the courage of our convictions.
It’s time to rise up, walk hand-in-hand to the front of the staff meeting and tell our administrators:
NO.
Because if we don’t, no one else will.

296,EDUCATION,Free Speech on Campus,"Geoffrey R. Stone, ContributorEdward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor of Law, Univers...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/free-speech-on-campus_b_6426082.html,"Of course, the ideas of different members of the University community will often and quite naturally conflict. But it is not the proper role of the University to attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply offensive.",2015-01-06,EDUCATION,"In light of recent events that have tested the commitment of colleges and universities across the nation to free and open discourse on campus, University of Chicago President Robert J. Zimmer appointed a faculty committee, chaired by me, to prepare a statement articulating the University of Chicago's commitment ""to free, robust, and uninhibited debate and deliberation among all members of the University's community.""
After carefully reviewing the University's history, examining events at other institutions, and consulting a broad range of individuals both inside and outside the University of Chicago, the committee crafted the following statement, which ""reflects the long-standing and distinctive values of the University of Chicago and affirms the importance of maintaining and, indeed, celebrating those values for the future."" I thought it might be instructive to share this statement more generally.
From its very founding, the University of Chicago has dedicated itself to the preservation and celebration of the freedom of expression as an essential element of the University's culture. In 1902, in his address marking the University's decennial, President William Rainey Harper declared that ""the principle of complete freedom of speech on all subjects has from the beginning been regarded as fundamental in the University of Chicago"" and that ""this principle can neither now nor at any future time be called in question.""
Thirty years later, a student organization invited William Z. Foster, the Communist Party's candidate for President, to lecture on campus. This triggered a storm of protest from critics both on and off campus. To those who condemned the University for allowing the event, President Robert M. Hutchins responded that ""our students . . . should have freedom to discuss any problem that presents itself."" He insisted that the ""cure"" for ideas we oppose ""lies through open discussion rather than through inhibition."" On a later occasion, Hutchins added that ""free inquiry is indispensable to the good life, that universities exist for the sake of such inquiry, [and] that without it they cease to be universities.""
In 1968, at another time of great turmoil in universities, President Edward H. Levi, in his inaugural address, celebrated ""those virtues which from the beginning and until now have characterized our institution."" Central to the values of the University of Chicago, Levi explained, is a profound commitment to ""freedom of inquiry."" This freedom, he proclaimed, ""is our inheritance."" 
More recently, President Hanna Holborn Gray observed that ""education should not be intended to make people comfortable, it is meant to make them think. Universities should be expected to provide the conditions within which hard thought, and therefore strong disagreement, independent judgment, and the questioning of stubborn assumptions, can flourish in an environment of the greatest freedom.""
The words of Harper, Hutchins, Levi, and Gray capture both the spirit and the promise of the University of Chicago. Because the University is committed to free and open inquiry in all matters, it guarantees all members of the University community the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn. Except insofar as limitations on that freedom are necessary to the functioning of the University, the University of Chicago fully respects and supports the freedom of all members of the University community ""to discuss any problem that presents itself."" 
Of course, the ideas of different members of the University community will often and quite naturally conflict. But it is not the proper role of the University to attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply offensive. Although the University greatly values civility, and although all members of the University community share in the responsibility for maintaining a climate of mutual respect, concerns about civility and mutual respect can never be used as a justification for closing off discussion of ideas, however offensive or disagreeable those ideas may be to some members of our community. 
The freedom to debate and discuss the merits of competing ideas does not, of course, mean that individuals may say whatever they wish, wherever they wish. The University may restrict expression that violates the law, that falsely defames a specific individual, that constitutes a genuine threat or harassment, that unjustifiably invades substantial privacy or confidentiality interests, or that is otherwise directly incompatible with the functioning of the University. In addition, the University may reasonably regulate the time, place, and manner of expression to ensure that it does not disrupt the ordinary activities of the University. But these are narrow exceptions to the general principle of freedom of expression, and it is vitally important that these exceptions never be used in a manner that is inconsistent with the University's commitment to a completely free and open discussion of ideas.
In a word, the University's fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong-headed. It is for the individual members of the University community, not for the University as an institution, to make those judgments for themselves, and to act on those judgments not by seeking to suppress speech, but by openly and vigorously contesting the ideas that they oppose. Indeed, fostering the ability of members of the University community to engage in such debate and deliberation in an effective and responsible manner is an essential part of the University's educational mission.
As a corollary to the University's commitment to protect and promote free expression, members of the University community must also act in conformity with the principle of free expression. Although members of the University community are free to criticize and contest the views expressed on campus, and to criticize and contest speakers who are invited to express their views on campus, they may not obstruct or otherwise interfere with the freedom of others to express views they reject or even loathe. To this end, the University has a solemn responsibility not only to promote a lively and fearless freedom of debate and deliberation, but also to protect that freedom when others attempt to restrict it.
As Robert M. Hutchins observed, without a vibrant commitment to free and open inquiry, a university ceases to be a university. The University of Chicago's long-standing commitment to this principle lies at the very core of our University's greatness. That is our inheritance, and it is our promise to the future.

297,EDUCATION,"DeVos Stands With Scoundrels, Not Students -- Part 2","David Halperin, ContributorAttorney, advocate, writer at RepublicReport.org",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/devos-stands-with-scoundrels-not-students-part-2_us_5a248304e4b05072e8b56a61,The U.S. Department of Education under Secretary Betsy DeVos this week began the next step in dismantling the rules issued,2017-12-04,EDUCATION,"The U.S. Department of Education under Secretary Betsy DeVos this week began the next step in dismantling the rules issued under President Obama to constrain the predatory abuses of for-profit colleges against students and taxpayers. Last month, the department moved toward taking apart the “borrower defense rule,” which created standards and procedures for students injured by their schools to obtain debt relief. This week, the rule on the chopping block is “gainful employment,” which established bare minimum measures to penalize schools that consistently leave their students with insurmountable debt. Today, at the end of the troubling first day of what’s called negotiated rulemaking on the gainful employment rule, members of the public were given an opportunity to speak. I was the only one to speak, and I said this: 
This proceeding is blocking a regulation that was carefully considered and carefully crafted to protect students and taxpayers from well-documented abuses by some career colleges. Blocking the gainful employment rule means that more students will enroll in programs that will ruin their financial futures.
These students, as before, will be veterans, single mothers, people of color, immigrants, and the forgotten Americans President Trump promised to fight for. Many will enroll because of false promises about the selectivity of the school, the urgency of enrolling immediately, the cost of attending, transferability of credits, job placement, starting salaries. Many will enroll in programs that aren’t strong enough to help them succeed.
Even if these students graduate ― and many don’t ― and even if they get the job they dreamed of ― and many won’t ― they may not earn enough to pay down their loans, because the tuition was just too high. That is the problem the GE rule addressed, implementing a law passed by Congress in 1965.
My colleagues and I know hundreds of men and women who are buried in debt from attending dishonest schools, or simply overpriced schools. They’re good people. All they wanted was a chance to pursue their dreams and make better lives for their families. But instead of standing with them, Secretary DeVos is now standing with the people who have caused the harm, the people who have pocketed billions and required taxpayer bailout after taxpayer bailout.
The gainful employment rule would save money for taxpayers by pushing the department to remove from federal aid those schools that leave students worse off than when they enrolled.
But the issue papers prepared by the department for this meeting suggest its determination to cancel legitimate protections for students and taxpayers. 
I know and respect some owners and executives of for-profit schools. Some really do want the best for their students. The industry has many good teachers. There are many student success stories; I know some of these students, too.
Some owners expressed legitimate concerns during past rule makings. But over eight years of the last administration, the department took those concerns into consideration, and I believe we ended up with rules and policies that are more than fair to schools, rules that penalize bad actors while rewarding colleges that actually help students train for careers. 
The department announced in January that about 800 programs failed the GE test ― less than 10 percent of all GE programs.
I’m dismayed that owners whose programs passed or came close to passing GE don’t want to step up and make their programs work, instead of fighting to trash regulations that would put their most unscrupulous, irresponsible competitors ― the ones who have ruined the industry’s reputation ― out of business.
This process today is, in reality, about the corruption of our system. It’s about the blatant desire of some for-profit colleges, which are associated with political appointees, donors, and friends of this administration, to go back to the recent bad old days, when they could act with impunity ― deceiving and abusing students in order to maximize profits. Their misconduct, which has led to scores of federal and state law enforcement actions, and is still very much ongoing, has been a national scandal. And if you don’t do the right thing here, this proceeding will extend and embody that scandal.
State attorneys general ― Republicans and Democrats ― will continue to fight against for-profit college fraud. Responsible Members of Congress, media, and advocates for students will continue to expose abuses, and more prospective students will get the truth about bad actors, even if Secretary DeVos continues to weaken enforcement efforts, relax oversight of accreditors, approve sham conversions to non-profit status, and gut accountability rules. The department will be on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of justice, and the wrong side of our people.
Keep the existing gainful employment rule. If you do, you will improve the effectiveness, integrity, reputation, and ultimately the success of career colleges, and you will help these students.

298,EDUCATION,"If Life Is a Game, What Are the Rules?","Stuart Muszynski, ContributorFounder and CEO, PurpleAmerica.us",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/if-life-is-a-game-what-ar_b_6199132.html,"The students who make up the poverty and homeless statistics that some suburbanites look at dispassionately, shaking their heads while proclaiming, ""Not in America!"" -- these kids want to succeed.",2014-11-21,EDUCATION,"A new report from the National Center on Family Homelessness indicates that 1 in 30 American children were homeless last year. That's a staggering figure that all Americans ought to be thrown by because it speaks to the dysfunction of our economic recovery as well as the lapses in the American Dream. It also speaks to a fact of urban life in America: that Americans living in poverty don't know the ""rules of the game.""
I discovered this several years ago through my work in delivering Project Love character-education and social-emotional learning programs in the Cleveland Public Schools (now the Cleveland Metropolitan School District). Following a Power of Kindness workshop, a Cleveland student asked to speak to me, profoundly pointing out that, ""If life is a game, then I don't know the rules.""
After another workshop, Keith, a white former gang member, volunteered to lead students in future sessions. I asked him why, given his background, he wanted to take the time to train other teens through the power of kindness. He responded, ""Until now, I didn't know there was another way.""
In Believe to Achieve, Project Love's intensive weekly programming for the most at-risk students in the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, facilitators start out with ninth-graders by discussing their life purpose. Figure that teens aren't interested? Guess again. 
The students who make up the poverty and homeless statistics that some suburbanites look at dispassionately, shaking their heads while proclaiming, ""Not in America!"" -- these kids want to succeed. But they first need to believe in themselves, and in their life purpose, hopes and dreams. Then they need to understand how to choose a mentor, ask for help, and build relationships. Then they need to graduate high school, learn workplace behaviors, get a job, go to college, or do both. Rules of the Game.
By following this formula, and connecting at-risk students with love -- a loving person who encourages them -- 85 percent of Believe to Achieve students, originally pegged as potential ninth grade dropouts, graduated from high school. Many became their school's top academic achievers.
But even after that, once they know the rules, they need to make a pact with their friends and mentors that they will succeed at the ""game of life."" They need social and emotional supports in order to ""win"" the game.
In the 2002 best-selling book The Pact, three friends who went through the Newark, New Jersey schools made a success pact, seeing each other through the trials, tribulations and dysfunctions of urban life and academic striving. They describe the continuing lure of the streets toward crime, drugs and decay and how their pact boosted each of them to success as doctors and a dentist. They found mentors, supported each other and learned ""the rules of the game.""
The statistics are indeed shameful -- homelessness, violence, poverty, hunger, dropping out -- and they accurately represent the cycle of poverty in Cleveland and elsewhere in urban and rural America. But the real shame is not the fault of these kids -- it's the fault of our education system for not teaching students the rules.
This will get worse. With the advent of Common Core standards and other stringent measures, this kind of social-emotional education will become more problematic for principals (whose schools are under a microscope) who opt for hard academics over soft skills. They're wrong. In order to win at the game of life, we need both. Just ask CEOs which skills lead to greater success and they will tell you that social-emotional competencies and character will result in greater success in the workplace and life.
The ""rules of the game"" are pretty simple but, in our current negative media world, without intervention, they're easily missed. However, if you get kids together to define them, their values shine through. Two weeks ago, Project Love assembled 2,000 teens at its annual Kickoff for Kindness rally at Cleveland State University to define these rules. As they tweeted ideas in response to compelling speakers, #rulesofthegame became the fourth most trending tweet of the day. Here are some of them:
Every teen can change the world. No matter what, keep your head up and stay strong. Don't be afraid to stand up! Everyone has a purpose. Do not end your life. Treat everyone equally. Stop the Hate! Give back and make a difference. Madison Wagner 8th grader challenges teens: have COURAGE! Do the right thing. Learn to Love and Love to Learn. Confront the haters. Be an example for others to follow. Be a role model. Treat people how you want to be treated. Character is who you are! Don't judge a book by its cover. Be respectful, be responsible, and be productive. Help the other people, even if you don't know them. Be authentic. Try not to give up on people or your friends. Speak up for those with no voice. One rule? Always be positive, it could rub off on someone. Don't take someone's kindness for weakness. Be a team player. Don't quit; you have one more move. Make your dream become reality. Stop sippin' on that HATErade. Be great. Don't let your pride stop you from speaking out. Change the cycle of your generation. Don't make excuses. It doesn't matter how you start -- it's where you finish. Love yourself and love others. Talk it out before throwing hands. Never allow yourself to be in a messed up situation. Stay true to yourself. Always spread your kindness to others. If u can't say anything nice don't say anything at all. Be nice to everyone, just by smiling at someone can make someone's day. Don't let anyone tell you who you are. Be courageous, be brave and be different. Make it your goal to make someone smile each and every day. Life doesn't give u a roadmap to happiness; in order to be truly happy u have to value yourself and the other people around u. Surround yourself with positive influences. Fill your heart with what's important and be done with the rest. Be a lover, not a fighter. Kindness is the key to success.
One of my closest friends, whose parents hid my parents during the Holocaust, once said to me: ""There are many angels and many devils, but you can choose whether you see the angels or see the devils."" I see many angels in these teens, and I have great hope that the ""rules of the game"" will empower kids to believe in themselves, repair our world, and fix the cycles of poverty, violence and negativity that plague America. We just need to give them the tools and our encouragement, and let them lead.

299,EDUCATION,Swearing an Oath -- Part 1,"Frank Breslin, ContributorRetired high-school teacher",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/swearing-an-oath----part_b_9123966.html,"Since taking their oath, many governors have begun to close public schools.  By violating their oath in so public a manner, they have shown that perjuring themselves means nothing to them, as does the fact that their first act in office was an act of perjury.",2016-01-31,EDUCATION,"There is a wondrous scene in Robert Bolt's play, A Man for All Seasons, when Thomas More is talking to his daughter as she tries to convince him to take the Oath of Supremacy to avoid execution by Henry VIII. He could simply take the oath, she suggests, without really believing in what he'd be saying, be released from the Tower, and return to his family. 
Sir Thomas, however, gently chides his daughter about why he cannot do this: that taking an oath is solemnly and publicly to call upon God to witness that what one is saying one truly believes in one's heart. Not believing it would be calling upon God to witness a lie, a most grievous wrong, a wrong he would not wish his daughter to think her father capable of. 
For in swearing an oath, he continues, one is proclaiming before God and the world that what one is saying is true, and that were he to lie, even though he'd be saving his life, he'd be losing his honor, his soul, and himself -- forever. Truly, a man for all seasons!  ***
Likewise, in taking his oath of office, a state governor is also solemnly and publicly calling upon God to witness that what he is saying, he intends to perform. He is swearing, in essence, that he will do all in his power to preserve, protect, and defend all the institutions and responsibilities of state government, including those of public education -- ""so help me God."" 
And, likewise, if he were lying and had no intention of carrying out those duties, he would also be calling upon God to witness a lie, a most grievous wrong, have lost his honor, his integrity, his very essence -- forever.
He would also be perjuring himself, and even, perhaps, be sentenced to prison. 
It is a fearful thing to swear such an oath and not intend to protect what one has sworn to protect, but even worse would it be to destroy it. By perjuring oneself, one would have revealed oneself before all the world to be morally unfit for such an office of high public trust. 
And, in a previous age, it was always thought dangerous to keep such a man in power, since in lying to God he would think nothing of lying to anyone, and there was no telling what such a man might do were he allowed to continue in power. ***
Since taking their oath, many governors have begun to close public schools. By violating their oath in so public a manner, they have shown that perjuring themselves means nothing to them, as does the fact that their first act in office was an act of perjury. 
The possibility that anyone will ever trust them again seems doubtful since everyone knows that a perjurer now resides in the governor's mansion. What happens to governors who perjure themselves naturally depends on the citizens of their states.
Until then, the question is why these governors who swore to protect public schools chose not only not to protect them, but also to destroy them. 
I'd like to discuss two possibilities. First, let's suppose that before taking their oath, these governors were all true believers in public education, and that only afterwards did they undergo a soul-changing ""Damascus experience,"" whereby they realized that the only way of saving these schools was by destroying them, as the saying went during the Vietnam era that ""the only way of saving a town was destroying it."" ***
The mystery is how to explain that all of these governors reacted in the very same way. How did these true believers in public schools suddenly become their fiercest opponents, so fierce, in fact, that far from trying to improve these schools, they replaced them with charters? 
What prompted these governors, now securely in power, to suddenly become so disenchanted with public schools that they're now closing them all over the country? 
How do they reconcile this with their oath, or do they simply refuse to face what they've done?
How did these educational neophytes all suddenly ""see the light"" at the same time? How did they discover that public schools were so beyond the pale of redemption that they had to be closed? 
Was this mass conversion to charters pure coincidence or the brainchild of the charter school industry itself, whose vision of a better world convinced these governors to rid America of its public schools, as the words of their oath were still ringing in their ears?  ***
How did all of these governors become suddenly conversant with educational research which so overwhelmingly convinced them that public schools must be abolished? 
Did it cross their minds that this newfound ""research"" might be nothing but a tissue of false accusations concocted by the same charter industry to undermine America's trust in its public schools to make way for charters?
Or that this was nothing but a hostile and highly financed corporate takeover being sold as educational ""reform""? 
Did these governors realize that no such ""research"" even existed?
 ***
What prompted their decision, contrary to their oath, to close these public schools rather than work to improve them as is the normal way of addressing such problems?   Was this option even considered, and, if so, why was it rejected in favor of charters, apart from their prospect of unlimited profits to potential investors?
Since tens of billions of dollars could yearly be diverted to charters from closed and already weakened public schools, why didn't these governors avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest by submitting this ""research"" to independent experts for a second and third opinion as a check against bias?  Why didn't they solicit the input of public-school officials for a more informed opinion before closing these schools? 
Or is this asking too much of human nature since money is always the most eloquent advocate when arguing a case?
Did this ""research"" unearth any problems that were not related to decades of systemic underfunding of public schools, as opposed to the billions that would now be pouring into charter coffers to elated investors?  ***
Why didn't these governors with their misgivings about public schools, which had served the nation well for over 150 years, bring their ""research"" to the public at once, lest it later be suggested that they simply colluded in inventing this claim? 
Or why didn't they call a national news conference to outline their findings and produce this ""research"" that would confirm their claim, research that, curiously, has never been provided?
More curiously still, why didn't the press, in that once grand tradition of investigative journalism, seize upon this absence of evidence and expose these governors for what they were doing? 
If closing public schools was contingent on ""evidence"" which was never provided, then it was safe to assume that it never existed for, if it did, these governors would have produced it in support of their claim. 
Put briefly, there was never a basis for closing these schools! 
Surely, seasoned journalists must have realized what was actually happening, so why didn't they go public with it? And now you begin to understand what is going on in this country.   ***
Or why didn't these governors hold exhaustive, wide-ranging, and televised hearings into these public-school ""weaknesses,"" call witnesses, and solicit learned opinion on both sides of this question? 
Did they think that the public didn't have a stake in the success of its schools and wouldn't want to know what was wrong with them? 
Or did these governors fear a public outcry from public-school parents who might have disagreed with them, thereby depriving these governors of a pretext for closing these schools?
Why didn't these governors want an open and honest public discussion about their claims, unless they feared they'd lose control of the narrative and be exposed as having no case?
Is it any wonder, then, that they proceeded by stealth rather than dealing with public anger during these hearings? Does this explain their cloak-and-dagger secrecy, their keeping to the shadows, their failure to provide information except when schools closures had occurred? 
Wasn't it easier to plunge these schools into chaos by simply closing them and replacing them with unregulated charters, without any proof of these charters' vaunted superiority, with their countless scandals of financial corruption that have since come to light?
 ***
And what of the millions of public-school children whose education has been disrupted? Why are these governors still bleeding their schools white by drastic underfunding to cause these children to fail and their schools to close and re-open as charters?
Why do the majority of these closings unfairly target Black and Hispanic children from poor neighborhoods in a new form of Jim Crow racism? 
And what of the millions of their outraged parents, whose lives, families, and neighborhood communities have been turned upside down by these governors beholden to a corporate agenda rather than the public schools they swore to protect?
And what of those tens of thousands of teachers thrown out of work because of an unfounded claim that their schools were failing, a tactic that weakens public-school unions as part of these governors' corporate agenda?
 ***
Was closing these schools about anything but a contempt for democracy and the rights of citizens, who now realize what they have always suspected -- that there is something very rotten in this state of Denmark?
Are these governors concerned about the open secret that their educational ""reform"" has been exposed as a hoax, devised by the charter school industry with the collusion of governors to weaken America's trust in its public schools?
Are they concerned that the public now understands that closing public schools was merely the pretext for enriching charters by misappropriating billions to defraud children of a public-school education, which has never been about profit for investors, but only about children?
Are they concerned that these unregulated charters are exempt from state regulations for keeping financial records, a golden inducement to widespread corruption?
Why did these governors and their state legislatures sanction these sweetheart deals in the charters they grant these privatized schools as a quid pro quo for campaign contributions in this brave new world of educational ""reform""?
Who will guard these guards themselves, who perjure themselves that they'll guard our democracy and its public schools, and then proceed to destroy them?
How do we protect ourselves against guards such as these, who think themselves above the law and too big to jail?

Rowling Clarifies We're Not Getting A New 'Harry Potter' Novel,Sara Boboltz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jk-rowling-harry-potter-cursed-child-book_us_56bc8bade4b0b40245c5650e,"It's a book, yes, but not a novel.",2016-02-11,ENTERTAINMENT,"News of a so-called ""eighth"" Harry Potter book flooded social media yesterday after publisher Little, Brown, announced it would be releasing the ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" script in book format on July 31. 
But, J.K. Rowling wants us all to know, it is not a novel like her seven others in the series. Like the publisher tweeted, it's a script in book format. 
Technically, calling it the ""eighth Harry Potter book"" is correct. An official site refers to ""The Cursed Child"" -- the two-part play opening in London this summer that is curiously not a sequel or a prequel to the series, but stars the same beloved characters -- as ""the eighth story"" in the Harry Potter series. As a book containing that story, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: Parts I & II will be the eighth book. It just won't read like Rowling's others.
The whole thing deals with our main character's adult life after the great Battle of Hogwarts.
""While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted,"" a description on the play's website reads. ""As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places."" 
The play debuts on July 30, but fans who can't make it to England can buy the book just one day after -- which also happens to be Rowling's (and Harry's) birthday.

Reinhart, who regularly posts updates about her life on Tumblr, bravely penned an emotional story about being sexually harassed by an older co-worker when she was just a teenager. 
The two met while working together on a project and developed a flirtation despite their age difference. They even went out on a date, but she left feeling “completely violated” after he tried to force himself on her. 
“He was incredibly charming and charismatic — we flirted for a while before we went on our first date,” the 21-year-old actress explained. “He was pretty significantly older than me, but I thought of myself as mature so it didn’t seem like a big deal.”
“All that matters is that he tried to force himself on me when we were on a date,” she continued. “I had to stop him and say ‘no, I don’t want that,’ and ‘I can’t do that.’” Reinhart said she had to walk away to prevent the situation from going further.
“I remember feeling like this was a scene right out of a horror movie,” she added.
Despite her insistence on wanting to be taken home, the individual started driving back to his apartment instead, where Reinhart suspected he planned to take advantage of her. 
“If I made it there, something bad was going to happen to me,” she continued. “I told him to drop me off at my home, that I didn’t want to go back to his place. He said some snarky comment but reluctantly brought me to where I was staying.”
Reinhart purposefully doesn’t mention the perpetrator by name, writing that she didn’t comfortable or believe it’s necessary, but reveals she confronted him the next day about how “how wrong it felt.”
“This guy proceeded to tell me that it was my fault for leading him on. Saying that ‘I seemed like a sexual girl and that I’d be down for it,’” Reinhart wrote.
The actress said that the individual later became angry and defensive, “claiming that I was ‘a tease’ and ‘the most manipulative woman he’d ever met,’” she said.
At the time, Reinhart chose to stay silent, given how much power the manhad on set. She also feared that no one would believe her if she spoke up, and recalled feeling guilty about the situation and doubted her own instincts during their encounter.
The actress is speaking out now to demonstrate how common these abuses toward women are in the film industry, and to show her support for all who choose to speak out about similar experiences. 
“So I understand how these women feel - the women coming forward about being harassed and assaulted by Harvey Weinstein,” she concluded. “I stand with them. I believe them. I believe in standing up for yourself as a woman and coming forward about sexual harassment.”

On the topic of homosexuality, from his perspective Robertson quipped that ""It seems like, to me, a vagina -- as a man -- would be more desirable than a man's anus,"" and he proclaimed that same-sex sexuality leads to promiscuity with multiple male and female partners, while likening it to bestiality. He concluded by paraphrasing 1 Corinthians 6-9 from the Christian testaments: ""Don't be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers -- they won't inherit the kingdom of God. Don't deceive yourself. It's not right.""  Three years prior to his GQ interview, Phil Robertson thrust his accusations even further as a guest speaker at the Berean Bible Church in Pottstown, Pennsylvania: ""Women with women, men with men, they committed indecent acts with one another and they received in themselves the due penancey for their perversions. They're full of murder, envy, strife, hatred. They are insolent, arrogant, God haters, they are heartless, they are faithless, they are senseless, they are ruthless, they invent ways of doing evil.""  On race relations and socioeconomic class: During his youth growing up in the Jim Crow South, Robertson talked about the ""singing and happy"" black people whom he worked alongside hoeing and picking cotton since, as Roberson phrased it, he himself was ""white trash."" ""I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once."" Then taking aim at current safety-net programs, he asserted: ""Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.""  On the environment: Robertson paraphrased Genesis 9 in rationalizing his chosen occupation of providing products for and in his own actions in hunting and killing ducks. ""After the flood, that's when [God] made animals wild. Up until that time, everybody was vegetarian. After the flood, he said, 'I'm giving you everything now. Animals are wild.'"" (Genesis 9:2 actually states: ""The fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts of the earth, and on all the birds in the sky, on every creature that moves along the ground, and on all the fish in the sea; they are given into your hands."")  Great Potential, But Missed Opportunity  Phil Robertson, in his own misguided and offensive fashion, has given us as a society much to unpack by his linking multiple issues and multiple form of oppression (heterosexism, racism, classism, environmental control and degradation), and all in the context of religious justification. 
Many critical questions arise, including, for me, ""How much longer are we as a society willing to condone so-called ""religious"" or theological justifications, especially in a society that purportedly separates religion from government, in the denial of rights, denial of respect, denial of first-class citizenship, and continuance of demeaning and dehumanizing representations and stereotypes of people who express their love, their sexuality, their relationships, and their very lives different from supposed heterosexual and ""traditionally"" gendered norms?  ""How much longer are we as a society willing to condone and engage in historical revisionism and stereotyping, as does Phil Robertson, in his categorization of the ""singing and happy"" and subservient blacks, and denial of his own white privilege by tuning out the realities that people of color face on a daily basis, today as well as during the Jim Crow South. Robertson needs also to read an introductory book on the history of music because if he had, he would have understood how absurd sounds his statement that the black people he knew in the South were not ""singing the blues"" since African-heritage people in U.S.-America created the musical form called ""The Blues.""
""How much longer are we as a society willing to marginalize and scapegoat working-class and poor white people in our categorization of them as ""white trash,"" and how much longer will white people of lower socioeconomic backgrounds refer to themselves in such demeaning terms internalized from the dominant culture?  ""How much longer are we as a society willing to blame people from lower socioeconomic classes for their limited resources, and when are we as a society going to come together as a nation to secure the safety nets that provide people greater opportunity to achieve their fullest potential?   ""How much longer are we as a society willing to justify our ruthless control and maltreatment of other life forms sharing our world, and how much longer are we going to engage in an insensitive and consuming degradation of the planet in our quest for its resources and our financial gain, all which some people continue to justify as ""God's plan""?  Unfortunately, rather have seeing these and other critical questions springing from Phil Robertson's statements, most attention in the media and by conservative political pundits have been misdirected to the firing of Robertson from the Duck Dynasty series by A&E, with the attendant questions related to issues of freedom of speech and the role of media.   While I find these questions extremely important, I see a great opportunity slipping away in the raising of issues to the highest level of public discourse regarding where we go as a multicultural society.   Throughout the checkered history of the United States, dominant groups have marginalized and attempted to silence opposing ideas and ideologies. During the current controversy, I am reminded of a poignant and cautionary quote from the great poet, essayist, and social activist, Audre Lorde, who asserted that we must not employ the tactics or use the language of those who oppose us, for she reminded us: ""The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house."" In other words, we must not replicate the language and the tactics of those who attempt to deny us our rights and our dignity.  Therefore, I call on A&E to reinstate Phil Robertson to his place on Duck Dynasty, and then, we can finally commence the public discourse on his statements rather than on his firing.

UPDATE:  The New York Times reports that the search for Ian Jones has been suspended after a male body matching his description was found in the Hudson River on Monday afternoon.
An autopsy will be performed on Tuesday to determine the cause of death and to confirm Jones' identity. 
PREVIOUSLY: Tali Lennox-Fruchtmann, the daughter of legendary singer Annie Lennox, was rescued on Saturday after her kayak capsized outside Poughkeepsie, New York. Meanwhile, authorities are still searching for her boyfriend, Ian Jones, officials told People magazine.
The 22-year-old model-turned-artist and her 32-year-old boyfriend were kayaking on the Hudson River when they capsized at about 9:30 a.m., Dutchess County Sheriff's Captain John Watterson told The Huffington Post.
Lennox-Fruchtmann was rescued by a boat that was passing by, but Jones was nowhere to be found, according to officials. Jones, who is a photographer, was not wearing a life preserver and officials believe alcohol may have played a role in the incident, TMZ reported.
The search continued until 10 p.m. Saturday as a helicopter scanned the area from above and searchers walked the shore, Watterson told HuffPost. Efforts resumed at 7:30 a.m. Sunday with a Marine patrol and a dive team scanning the river. 
Authorities say there is a real possibility Jones may have drowned, since neither he nor Lennox-Fruchtmann were wearing life preservers. Watterson maintained they are doing everything they can to find him.

311,ENTERTAINMENT,We're Still Trying To Make Sense Of 'Inherent Vice',E. Oliver Whitney and Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/inherent-vice-review_n_5935024.html,,2014-10-06,ENTERTAINMENT,"Mainstream audiences may not have Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film on their fall movie radar as much as, say, David Fincher's ""Gone Girl"" or Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar,"" but they definitely should. ""Inherent Vice,"" the newest film from the writer-director of ""The Master,"" ""There Will Be Blood"" and ""Boogie Nights,"" is a convoluted, hilarious 1970s stoner noir adapted from Thomas Pynchon's novel of the same name. Joaquin Phoenix stars as Larry ""Doc"" Sportello, a private investigator who begins searching for his missing ex-girlfriend when the worlds of Los Angeles real estate, drugs, gangs, the music industry and the LAPD clash. The large ensemble includes Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro, Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson, Jena Malone, Michael Kenneth Williams, Eric Roberts, Maya Rudolph, Katherine Waterston, Joanna Newsom, Martin Short and so many more. Here's what HuffPost Entertainment editors Erin Whitney and Matthew Jacobs thought of the film when it premiered at the New York Film Festival on Saturday:

Jacobs: ""Inherent Vice"" was without a doubt the most enigmatic movie of the New York Film Festival lineup. We'd seen the first trailer just days before Saturday's world premiere, and beyond that we knew little other than to look for a possible Thomas Pynchon cameo and lot of wild hairstyles. Having read Pynchon's opaque novel, I knew to expect a haze of indica-infused psychedelia. But now that we've seen the movie, I feel like it's not much less enigmatic than it was when we were cubs just waiting in a rainy Saturday-morning line to see the latest film from Paul Thomas Anderson (PTA, as we lovingly call him). 
Anderson is one of the great directors of our day. ""Boogie Nights"" and ""There Will Be Blood"" are easy entries on any list of the best movies of the past two decades. But I wonder if he might have overshot here. The winding nature of ""Inherent Vice,"" in which vignettes pile up on each other and characters intersect in ways that sometimes feel increasingly vague, is as cloudy as the countless rooms in which Doc Sportello (Phoenix) lights a joint. It's apparent Anderson wasn't interested in streamlining the plot; he stays almost lock-step faithful to Pynchon's storytelling approach, in which the revolving door of characters often feels secondary to capturing the right psychedelic tone. Riotous for the first half hour, the movie is never not entertaining, but it seems like a bigger statement should come from it. And maybe there is one, but I was too busy ironing out the plot to find it. I enjoyed ""Inherent Vice,"" but it's not necessarily a great thing that I want to see it again partly to ensure I actually caught everything that happened. 

Whitney: I haven't been able to stop thinking about and mulling over ""Inherent Vice"" yet, and for me, that's always a sign that I've really begun to fall in love with a movie. PTA's wild stoner noir is like a delicious blend between Robert Altman's ""The Long Goodbye"" and the Coen brothers' ""Big Lebowski."" As the spaced-out hippie druggie (but he just smokes weed now) Doc Sportello, Phoenix is perfect as he bounces around L.A. trying to put fragments of a seemingly endless mystery together. He's the type of private investigator who makes everyone question the authority that gave him his license, the guy you'd be lucky to find wearing flip-flops, if beyond bare feet. We flat through his beach-bum stoner haze throughout the film as we're spun around from one crazed, convoluted storyline to the next. There's the real estate tycoon's kidnapping case, a ""pussy lovers"" love-in, a hippie musician brigade in a Topanga Canyon mansion, a dentist office with copious amounts of drugs and sex, a sober retreat in Ojai, a foggy back alley with whispers of a drug trade and so, so much more. I now realize that neither of us have even begun explaining the plot of this movie, but then again what the hell even happened?
Okay, well I have a vague idea of what went down in the film's 148 minutes as I attempted to map it out in my head without getting lost and having to mentally catch up with the next scene. But like you said, it's the ensemble of characters who are constantly juggling and building PTA's thick drug-induced state of L.A. madness and mistrust. ""Inherent Vice"" is not just a neo-noir crime drama, or a nostalgic celebration of '70s drug culture, but something so much more about the never-ending chaos of life that we can't stop from shattering at times. I usually don't like feeling too lost during a film, but there's something about PTA's multi-layered marijuana-drenched quilt of L.A. deception that makes me want to visit it again and again to crack the case and catch more clues. What do you think, Matt, is this a film that will richen over time with more viewings and more time to think on it? I have a feeling it's somewhat of a ""Pulp Fiction"" of our time that will develop an avid cult (and predominately cinephile) fanbase.

Jacobs: I very much agree with your assessment, Erin. I don't mean to be too harsh. I feel certain this movie is an achievement -- one just has to lock down what exactly that achievement is. The premise, and this is the case with Pynchon's book also, is obviously meant to be perplexing. It's as if to say that the convoluted world in which these characters live -- threatened by the Aryan Brotherhood, bamboozled by the never-ending Vietnam War, panicked by the threat of Charles Manson -- is so erratic and confounding that their lives must echo that too. By that count, the movie is a success. 
Phoenix is perfect for the part, with his ruffled hair, muttonchops and vacant gaze, but the supporting cast (barring short appearances from Reese Witherspoon, Martin Short and Joanna Newsom) isn't all that special when broken down as individual players. That, too, might prove that Anderson is drawing from a world rather than a story, which, to his credit, doesn't feel foreign to the director's repertoire. Each of his movies zeroes in on subsets of American culture at certain moments in time, from the '70s porn scene in ""Boogie Nights"" to the cultish post-war proclivities in ""The Master."" ""Inherent Vice"" builds another of PTA's intricate worlds, and it captures it with a gusto. I just think it's a shame (perhaps even a flaw) that many won't find a rich connection to it because the plot is so woozy. The movie doesn't push quite hard enough on the anti-capitalism/anti-establishment sentiments that become a hippie-happy through line in the novel. We get a mild sense of the Manson hysteria alongside the general paranoia that ran rampant in 1970 California, but it feels like the movie doesn't retain the first half hour's humor or make any meaningful statements quite boldly enough. Plus, its 148 minutes feels a tad too long. If we let that go, becoming enchanted with ""Inherent Vice"" is easy. Just give yourself over to the plot -- it certain won't yield to us. That said, I am excited to see it again in the coming months, and by no means am I less of a PTA apostle because of it. I'm not sure it's another ""Pulp Fiction,"" but it'll certainly have some strong advocates.

Whitney: I can definitely see your point, Matt, and can agree that it does shy away from any overt statements on the political environment that so sharply defined that era. Besides Owen Wilson's ""surf-sax"" musician referencing Vietnam, these characters never seem too concerned with anything outside of their own corrupt city. But I also think that's why I enjoyed PTA's world so much -- it didn't feel like a trite or overly nostalgic attempt to capture the '70s. It's a world I found myself wishing I could live in (so maybe it did make me nostalgic ...), hanging out on Doc's couch and following him around on his perilous excursions as Joanna Newsom's Sortilège does. Her character, who provides an on-and-off-again voiceover, was so interesting to me mostly because she revealed Doc's inner monologue that we would otherwise never hear from the rather reserved stoner. I haven't read the book and don't know her place in it, but in the press conference following the film, PTA mentioned how her voiceover narration was a big question for him. It's the first time the director has used it in a film and I think it struck that great balance between giving deeper insight to a character -- an insight I found to have a subtle feminine gentleness that Doc alone doesn't carry -- without the overbearing omniscience of a preachy narrator. 
At the end of it all, ""Inherent Vice"" is an equally difficult film to write about as much as it is to watch. Anyone looking for a movie with concise plot connections that lead to a clear destination should look elsewhere. And I'm not even sure all PTA devotees will celebrate it; the filmmaker has a tendency to divide critics with his diverse storytelling style and there seems to be no decipherable formula to the man's wild mind. Perhaps PTA intends for us to enter the film in Doc's always-groovy state of mind to better navigate the frantic story and care less about the sum of its parts. Inherent vice, after all, means the unavoidable deterioration of objects, or the refusal to insure that which is self-destructive. Maybe we're supposed to take the film's convoluted fragments for what they are and not press for a solidified understanding for fear of destroying it all. But then again, let me get back to you after I've seen it six more times.
""Inherent Vice"" opens in limited release on December 12 and wide release on January 9.

But box-office revenue is just the tip of the iceberg. Fan loyalty is worth its weight in gold to Disney. Forbes estimates that the ""Star Wars"" franchise has earned over $12 billion from toys and other merchandise, $3.4 billion from games and over $1.8 billion from book sales.
In short, George Lucas and Disney/Lucasfilm are flush.
The franchise's following is so massive that it is unrealistic to accurately estimate the number of Jedi wannabes on this earth. That said, ""Star Wars"" box-office records are a strong indication that everyone worth knowing loves ""Star Wars"" the force is strong among millions of fans.
Even if you're on the dark side (""I find your lack of faith disturbing""), you can't deny the film's impact on this earth. The space saga has its own Wookieepedia (when it was launched in 2005, that was a big deal), a Death Star in Dubai, and many more things in its honor. Hell, ""Star Wars"" has it's own beetle species. Without George Lucas, there would be no drunk stormtroopers or ""Star Wars"" weddings.
""Star Wars: Episode VIII"" hits theaters Dec. 15, 2017 and will almost certainly break more records and lead to stranger merchandise and themed weddings. To quote Obi-Wan Kenobi, the force will be with us always.

Now, with a comeback on the horizon as his ninth studio album, ""Man Against Machine"" just went platinum, the 53-year-old singer opened up to People magazine about why he walked away from fame. 
""People said, 'How could you walk away from music?' But being a dad -- there's nothing that can touch that,"" he told the magazine, explaining that he left the limelight to spend time with his three daughters from his first marriage, to Sandy Mahl.
Brooks went from playing his biggest hits at sold-out stadiums to playing stay-at-home single dad. In 1999, he separated from Mahl and moved with his daughters into a small bunkhouse on his ranch in Oklahoma. It was a change the singer says took some getting used to. 
At first Brooks said he'd ""just stare"" at his kids, explaining, ""I knew their sweet faces and their dispositions. But I didn't know who they were."" 
Over time, the family adjusted, and Brooks even became a regular soccer dad. 
""You start being a part of the community,"" he told the magazine. ""The dads across the soccer field looked at me as a dad just like them. And I was very grateful."" 
But these days, now that all of his children have graduated high school, he's dealing with empty-nest syndrome. Unlike most parents, however, he's keeping himself busy with a world tour with wife Trisha Yearwood. Last July, the singer announced his triumphant return to music with a three-year global tour and a new record deal with Sony Music Nashville.
Touring with Yearwood has also helped with that transition. ""Thank God I'm with the love of my life,"" he said. ""That's why I know I'm right where I'm supposed to be.""

Shepherd told The Huffington Post last week that Ripa would have likely been informed about his departure much earlier had the gender roles been reversed.

Shepherd added that gender inequalities in the workplace affect women across industries and socio-economic class. In fact, it's a ""frustrating"" reality that she's experienced herself. 
""I've had this happen all the time,"" she said. ""[A male colleague and I will] be doing the same thing, and I have more experience, and he starts off the bat making more money that me.

323,ENTERTAINMENT,"Dreamworks Strikes Deals With YouTube, Netflix, And Toy Companies In An Attempt To Diversify","Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dreamworks-strikes-deals-youtube-netflix_us_5bb433b7e4b066f8d25623b1,"Dreamworks hopes acquisitions can help expand its popular franchises, such as ""Shrek"" and ""Kung Fu Panda,"" beyond the big",2013-08-04,ENTERTAINMENT,"By Ronald Grover and Lisa Richwine
LOS ANGELES, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Dreamworks Animation SKG Inc , the studio that built one of Hollywood's largest film franchises on the back of a green ogre named Shrek, has suddenly become one of the entertainment industry's busiest dealmakers.
In the last year, Dreamworks has bought a YouTube network aimed at teenagers and picked up a company that controls such iconic characters as Lassie and Casper the Friendly Ghost. It acquired the rights to the Troll toy franchise and in June, signed a deal to produce a TV series for streaming video service Netflix Inc. It also plans to build a $3 billion entertainment complex with partners in China.
And Dreamworks isn't finished.
""There will definitely be more deals,"" Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg said in an interview. ""I have never seen more opportunities to build our brand in our 19 years in business.""
Katzenberg will not say what else is on his list, or whether he prefers to buy or partner with other companies.
One thing still percolating, he says, is a Dreamworks cable channel, ""but there's nothing out there right now for us.""
A few years back, Dreamworks considered selling itself to a larger media company in hopes of converting its cable channel to one featuring Dreamworks movies or TV shows, according to news reports at the time.
Dreamworks' acquisition spree comes at a time when the animated film market has become so saturated with studio-backed fare that the studio's most recent entry, ""Turbo,"" debuted with two other animated films already in the market.
""Turbo"" ended up with lackluster ticket sales of $21 million in the United States and Canada during its first weekend. Earlier this year, Dreamworks took an $87 million write down for its holiday-themed ""Rise of the Guardians,"" and another $54 million charge to rework ""Me & My Shadow.""
Dreamworks hopes acquisitions can help expand its popular franchises, such as ""Shrek"" and ""Kung Fu Panda,"" beyond the big screen to television, toys and even theme parks. It is a formula that helped turn Walt Disney Co into the largest media conglomerate, with a market value of $118 billion. Dreamworks is tiny in comparison, with a market value of about $2.3 billion.
Investors have welcomed Katzenberg's diversification strategy, sending Dreamworks shares up 50 percent in the past year.
As a result of dealmaking, analyst Tony Wible of Janney Montgomery Scott predicts about 45 percent of Dreamworks' revenue this year will come from non-movie making, including TV shows produced by Classic Media, which Dreamworks bought last summer for $157.6 million.
Classic Media owns the rights to animated characters Richie Rich, Dick Tracy, and George of the Jungle, among others.
A year ago, Wible said, Dreamworks was getting only about 15 percent of revenue from areas other than newly released films, with most of that coming from DVD sales of older movies.
This year, Dreamworks expects to bring in $100 million in revenue from its television ventures. The estimate does not include revenue from AwesomenessTV, the teen-oriented YouTube network Dreamworks acquired in May.
Over the next five years, Dreamworks says it will produce 1,200 hours of programs for companies such as Netflix and German kids channel Super RTL, including those inspired from ""Turbo"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon.""
Dreamworks also will market merchandise from the Troll toy franchise after buying the rights to the line in April.
In July, a Dreamworks attraction with a Disney-style character-parade and other entertainment opened at the Sands Cotai Central casino, owned by Sands China Ltd, in Macau.
Dreamworks also is expanding in China, and is working with partners through a joint venture called Oriental Dreamworks to build a $3.1 billion entertainment district that will open in Shanghai in 2016. In addition, the venture will produce live-action movies and animated films for Chinese audiences.
But Katzenberg, who headed Disney's movie studio for a decade until 1994, denies the flurry of deals is a bid to recreate a modern day version of the media giant's far flung entertainment empire.
""Times have changed, this is totally different,"" he said. ""The thing we had in common were a great brand, some great content and a lot of opportunities to expand.""

This year's New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center has proved a remarkable showcase for women in film. The latest from cult cirector Kelly Reichardt (""Meek's Cutoff,"" ""Night Moves"") sets in motion three vignettes, only casually linked, about a trio of women who are up against it in differing ways. It's uncertain what they're doing in the same film, except for the fact that their stories (drawn from the collection ""Both Ways is the Only Way I Want It"" by Maile Meloy) are shot against the majestic backdrop of Montana's mountains and big skies in gorgeous 16mm. Perhaps the three are connected as well by their aloneness (though one is a wife and mother), which is underscored by the vastness of the terrain, and a common struggle to find, if not happiness, exactly, then a viable way forward in challenging circumstances. 
The excellent Laura Dern as a harried lawyer could be the poster girl for today's chronically overextended woman. Film opens among the rumpled sheets of her noon tryst with a man (James Le Gros) who's later revealed to be married. Back at work, Dern's struggling to cope with an injured client (Jared Harris) who's gone off the rails, after getting screwed by his worker's compensation claim. She'll later become entrapped in his escalating desperation. 
Gina (Reichardt regular Michelle Williams) is the wife, we learn, of Laura Dern's sack mate - and in his brief screen moments Le Gros conveys to perfection a hunky male who knows he's catnip to women. His wife seems to have channeled her libido into building their new home - maybe one reason he channels his elsewhere. Her anger at him simmers beneath the surface. Further tensions arise when she strong arms a doddering old man into parting with some sandstone blocks on his property that hold sentimental value for him. What's at stake in this second vignette, however, is too elusive to register.
Worth the price of admission is the third, most fully realized panel of this triptych. That it's delivered in Reichardt's trademark damped-down style make it all the more wrenching. Newbie Lily Gladstone is a Native American ranch hand in a remote corner of the state who wanders by accident into the adult education classes conducted by a frazzled Kristen Stewart. After they adopt a ritual of hitting the local beanery after class, it's clear Gladstone has become enamored of Stewart in a somehow innocent way -- she's likely never heard the term homo-erotic. Stewart, dead-eyed and ashy-skinned from her four hour commute - and oblivious to the effect of her glamor on the girl -- wants only to find a gig closer to home. 
The money-scene arrives toward the end, when Gladstone gives Stewart a lift on horseback to her waiting car, the girl's face radiant with a happiness she never knew existed. The stunner of a denouement shows just how unreadable humans can be to each other. Reichardt takes inspired liberties with Meloy's story by making the farmhand a female -- in the original he's a hapless guy - which angles the tale toward something more haunting. 
Reichardt also excels at dramatizing the collision in the same time frame of unrelated crises. In a memorable scene from the first vignette, Laura Dern's client sits freaking out in her car, just as her lover calls to dump her - as if he'd just remembered he had a wife and daughter. Dern's face - the visual equivalent of What the F -- , mirrors the weirdness and pain of the moment. Reichardt is at her best when she teases out these small miseries of everyday life. It's hard to get your arms around any over-arching theme in Certain Women, but perhaps it's the separateness of humans operating at cross-purposes as they each pursue their idea of happiness.

Whether it will snow or not at the Super Bowl is a big question in the days prior to the game at East Rutherford, N.J., on Sunday, as there may be travel implications and more challenging stadium preparation.
While snow chances may be over in time for the big game, the cold will linger. So, another question remains: will it be cold enough for beer to freeze?
Frozen beer was a problem for fans of the Green Bay Packers and San Francisco '49ers during the NFC Wild Card game on Jan. 5, 2014, at Lambeau Field. The high temperature was only 12 F with a low of minus 5 F.
A typical strength beer with 5 percent alcohol by volume will freeze near 26 to 29 F, according to Karl Siebert, professor of biochemistry and director of the Brewing Program at Cornell University.
The time it takes for a beer to freeze depends on the starting temperature of the beer and the temperature of its surroundings, Siebert said.
""I think wind would not be much of a factor,"" he said. ""It happens much faster with cans than bottles because metal conducts heat better than glass and glass has a larger thermal mass -- it's a lot thicker.
Weather may play a factor in the game, but AccuWeather.com Senior Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said the odds are against another beer freeze.
The high Sunday at MetLife Stadium will be in the mid-30s with a low in the mid-20s.
""The cold is going to be entrenched in the Northeast,"" Rayno said. ""You won't have to worry the beer will get warm too fast.""
Frozen beer isn't harmful but it could turn hazy, especially with repeated freeze/thaw cycles, Siebert said.
""This is unsightly but not harmful,"" he said.
Freezing could cause beer to gush out of a can or bottle when they're opened. However, cold beer is not necessarily a bad thing. The ideal beer temperature depends on the beer style and local customs, Siebert said.
""In Britain, the tradition is to serve ale at room temperature in a pewter mug,"" he said. ""With lagers in the U.S., cool, or even frosty, conditions are often seen. With colder temperatures, a drinker experiences less of the flavor. I think refrigerator temperature is a good compromise.""

Of all the strange ways to get buried in this world, the western tradition of burial may be the most bizarre. As opposed to many of the funeral rites observed elsewhere, our form of traditional burial – with its embalming fluids, caskets, liners, vaults and tombs – aims to preserve the body for as long as possible, with the express purpose, it would seem, of not returning it to nature. No ashes to ashes, dust to dust for a body pumped with formaldehyde and housed in a metal casket.  Yet traditional burial seems to be a trend in decline; natural burials are on the rise, and 41 percent of Americans are now opting for cremation, a process considered “all but taboo” 50 years ago. And with this increase in cremations, there is a whole new array of services to deal with the cremation remains. (Are you really going to pass down an urn of ashes for generations to come?)  One way is to incorporate the ashes into concrete and sink it into the ocean.  Known as a reef ball burial, the cast forms create new marine habitats for fish and other forms of sea life. Due to human activity and natural disasters, the ocean’s natural reef systems have been significantly reduced and thus, enduring artificial reefs have become a useful tool for restoring reef systems to a natural and productive balance.

One company, Eternal Reefs, has teamed up with The Reef Ball Foundation to address the problem of the reefs and to provide a natural burial option. Cremated remains are mixed into “100 percent natural cast concrete” to create a “pearl.” Once the pearl has been cast, the family can personalize it with handprints or messages etched into the damp concrete and add small mementos.  On the dedication day, a boat is chartered for friends and family to observe the reef ball as it is placed in the reef where it will become an established habitat. The fish, turtles and other forms of sea life are happy — and there’s one less urn of ashes to get lost in the attic.

Here’s the good news: According to the wonks at the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute, the average car sold in March was 25.4 mpg, a new record. In truth, fuel economy has been improving all year — it’s up 0.4 percent since January.  Aha, you say, the sunny skies will yield to clouds — if people get better fuel economy (or even buy electric cars), they’ll drive more. It’s human nature; people travel more when it’s less painful to them.  David Owen wrote about this in the New Yorker. Give people Energy Star air-conditioners and they’ll just turn them on more. Owen calls it the Jevons Paradox: ""This effect is usually referred to as ‘rebound’ — or, in cases where increased consumption more than cancels out any energy savings, as ‘backfire,’” he wrote.
But Matt Mattila of the Rocky Mountain Institute denies that factor is at work with drivers because most don’t even know their fuel economy. And even if they did, they’re unlikely to take advantage of it by covering more miles. You might be better off saying that because Americans are heavier, they're hurting fuel economy gains. (That one's true.)  The University of California Transportation Center says it measured this “rebound effect” back in 2007 and discovered “that it is not large. Moreover, we find that it has become smaller over time, and is likely to become smaller still. This means that improved fuel efficiency does translate into lower fuel consumption.”  And guess what? Actual vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and fuel consumed continues to fall, despite population growth and the supposed backlash everybody’s worried about. The absolute amount of fuel consumed by American cars and trucks fell 11 percent between 2004 (when fuel use hit a peak) and the end of 2012.  Americans are driving less and using less fuel. The rates for 2012 distance driven roughly mirror the mid-1990s, and the fuel consumed is lower than in 1984 (when the University of Michigan’s figures begin).  Michigan’s Michael Sivak admits there’s some truth to the rebound effect: “Having more efficient vehicles will lead to an increase in driving,” he said. “But the general consensus is that only about 10 percent of the gain in fuel economy is effectively lost due to an increase in driving. In other words, 90 percent of the gain in fuel economy is retained — not compensated for by increased driving.”  So go ahead and buy that Prius or Nissan Leaf. Here are some great choices for fuel-efficient used cars. You’re not likely to drive it much more than your current car.

Rather brazenly, Washington and its Pacific allies spy on those who are intent on reining in global warming.   Indeed, according to the Guardian newspaper, which wrote a report based on Edward Snowden's recent disclosures, the National Security Agency or N.S.A. spied on Ban Ki-moon and obtained the United Nations Secretary General's ""talking points"" on climate change. The N.S.A. carried out its espionage prior to a recent meeting between Ban and President Obama at the White House. 
 It's unclear if Obama read the N.S.A. reports, or tried to outmaneuver Ban based on such intelligence. Nevertheless, the Guardian story reinforces other disclosures which cast the N.S.A. and its Pacific partners in an unflattering environmental light. According to revelations stemming from the so-called ""Cable Gate"" scandal, the U.S. and Japanese governments discussed taking action to weaken well known anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd. 
 The group's activists, whose ships routinely confront whalers on the high seas, have long been a thorn in the side of Japanese officials. Seeking to appease Tokyo, the Americans discussed revoking Sea Shepherd's tax exempt status in the United States.
Crass Five Eyes Network and Australia
 What is more, the U.S. maintains close ties to Australia, a country which maintains privileged access to something called the ""Five Eyes"" network. According to other recent reporting, Australia has stopped at nothing when it comes to advancing its own cynical oil espionage within the wider Pacific region. 
 The revelations, which are contained in an article published by the Sydney Morning Herald, suggest that Australia spied on East Timor during sensitive 2004 negotiations over the future of the Timor Gap oil and gas reserves. In an echo of the Watergate scandal, the Australians reportedly bugged Timorese government offices in Dili at the behest of Canberra's own foreign minister.
 East Timor had only gained independence from Indonesia five years before, and regarded the Timor Gap as an ideal opportunity to stabilize government finances. Unfortunately, Australia also laid claim to the offshore energy reserves, and cash-strapped and politically fragile East Timor was eventually obliged to agree to a maritime treaty with Canberra which many in Dili regarded as unfair.   What is more, some charge that the treaty was hastily conceived and did not provide adequate protections for the environment. In 2009, a huge Australian oil spill in the Timor Sea caused anger and consternation in Jakarta and Dili.
Pacific Spying in an Age of Climate Change
 Five Eyes spying would be crass and cynical in even the best of times, but recent reports of the network's espionage are particularly jarring in light of catastrophic climate change within the wider region. Indeed, a new study has found that the Pacific is taking in heat at the most elevated rate in many thousands of years.
 According to scientists, extreme storm events like typhoon Haiyan, which devastated the Philippines, will become more likely in the future as a result of the build-up of greenhouse gases. What is more, researchers add that there will be greater risk of intense rainfall and flooding when cyclones actually hit land. 
 Haiyan was the third time that catastrophe struck in the Philippines in less than a year: in August, another typhoon resulted in huge flooding on the island of Luzon. In December, 2012 typhoon Bopha caused the deaths of 2,000 Filipinos on the island of Mindanao. 
 Meanwhile, the low-lying Pacific nation of Kiribati recently confirmed plans to buy land in Fiji so as to assure ongoing food security for its own people. Kiribati was prompted to undertake such drastic measures since its own food production has been devastated by sea level rise and saline water intruding upon its fertile soil.
 Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in Poland, an emotional Filipino delegate recently connected climate change with devastating typhoons which have hit his country. Yet, according to recent reports U.S. negotiators have still done their utmost to delay emission reduction commitments at the conference.
 In light of such crass negotiations, as well as cynical environmental spying emanating from the Five Eyes network, Pacific islands might want to pursue a more unconventional geopolitical strategy which protects their interests. Unfortunately, small island nations have received scant support from left-leaning Latin America when it comes to pushing a radical climate change agenda. Yet, like the small island nations, Latin America has also been caught in the crosshairs of N.S.A. espionage. Perhaps, as spying revelations continue to leak out, some Latin American leaders will be encouraged to change course and take bolder action.

Some experts, however, are more concerned about the debris we may never see but that might still pose a threat to human health. 
""Over long periods of time, big plastics degrade into smaller and smaller particles, and these may create an additional route of exposure to certain chemical contaminants,"" said Courtney Arthur, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Debris Program.
As sunlight and waves break down plastic materials into pieces the size of fish food, new research suggests that fish may mistakenly eat the so-called microplastics and subsequently absorb chemicals into their bodies. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins, among other toxins, could then travel up the food chain and onto our dinner plates. 
These pollutants have been linked to everything from hormone problems to neurological disorders to cancer in humans.
So far, microplastic debris -- generally defined as particles less than one millimeter wide, or about half the head of a pin -- have turned up in every ocean on the planet, including samples recently collected from Puget Sound, Chesapeake Bay and San Francisco Bay. Species along the entire length of the marine food chain have been found to ingest the tiny particles: sharks, sea turtles and krill, among others. It may not necessarily be the seafood we eat that has consumed the plastic, but rather the marine life in our food's diet. As chemicals move up the food chain, they can accumulate into larger and more toxic concentrations.
Last year, researchers discovered that about 80 percent of the plastic they collected along shorelines was in the form of small particles. Other studies have linked the amount of plastic in the guts of seabirds to the levels of PCBs in their body tissues, and research has found that microplastics fed to mussels can actually relocate from the gut to blood cells. 
""It appears quite likely that contaminants migrate from plastic into the organism,"" said Chelsea Rochman, a doctoral student studying the toxicity of marine plastic debris at the University of California, Davis. She added that it is still too early to say with certainty that the contaminants from microplastics are absorbed by body tissues, but she hopes her research will get closer to an answer. Rochman recently collected fish and water samples in the South Atlantic to measure contaminant levels and is awaiting results. 
Many of the chemicals added to plastics during their manufacture, including flame retardants and bisphenol A, are known to be hazardous. Plastics also attract a ""toilet bowl"" of pesticides, oil and other runoff from land and boats, said Rochman. The smaller the particle, the more relative surface area to soak up PCBs and other contaminants.
""Some plastic particles can have up to a million times as many pollutants stuck on them than are present in ambient sea water,"" said Marcus Eriksen, executive director of the nonprofit 5 Gyres Institute. ""They become a toxic little pill.""
The million-plus tons of plastic estimated to have been added to the oceans by the Japanese tsunami will expand the swirls of plastic rubbish already present by an estimated 10 percent, according to Eriksen. 
Eriksen's 5 Gyres team, along with other marine scientists such as Linda Amaral Zettler of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., are collecting samples from the Western North Pacific Gyre in hopes of determining the fate of plastics from the tsunami debris -- and whether microbes may actually be helping to degrade plastics. Emerging research suggests this is the case, although Amaral Zettler noted that it's not yet clear whether the microbes mobilize potential toxins, making them more harmful, or if they actually keep the toxins from entering the food chain. 
Research into microplastics is still in its very early stages and there is a lot yet to learn. Just how many of the little plastic bits are out there? To what extent do they they threaten marine life and human health? All of these questions are now of personal importance to Eriksen. He and his wife, Anna Cummins, are anticipating the arrival of their first child. 
Cummins, co-founder of 5 Gyres, knows that she can pass on hazardous chemicals to her developing baby. So she is being careful to avoid foods packaged in plastic, and when she does eat fish -- important for a fetus' brain development -- she chooses the smaller varieties that are lower in the food chain, and are therefore less likely to contain high concentrations of pollutants.
""I'm not personally worried about the levels in my body,"" she said. ""But I follow the precautionary principle as a pregnant woman and stay away from the top predators.""

337,ENVIRONMENT,Earth to Newt: Tar Sands Oil = High Gas Prices,"Carl Pope, Contributor
Principal Advisor at Inside Straight Strategies",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gingrich-gas-prices_us_5bb10ed1e4b09bbe9a59e09c,"Gingrich has pledged that if he is elected, gas prices will be reduced to $2 or $2.50 gallon. Were this to happen, however, no one would be more unhappy than TransCanada, the builder of the Keystone Pipeline.",2012-03-10,ENVIRONMENT,"Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum and Republican Congressional leaders like John Boehner have decided that high gas prices are the key to their defense against President Obama and the Democrats -- and they have decided that building the Keystone XL Pipeline is the symbol of their commitment to bringing down gas prices through ""drill, baby drill"" strategies.
Gingrich, in particular, following in Michelle Bachmann's earlier unsuccessful shoes, has pledged that if he is elected, gas prices will be reduced to $2 or $2.50 gallon. Were this to happen, however, no one would be more unhappy than TransCanada, the builder of the Keystone Pipeline. Because at $2 gallon, there is simply no market for its product -- tar sands oil is only profitable when crude oil prices are above $70 barrel. To get gasoline down to $2, crude must fall below $50 -- meaning an empty Keystone Pipeline.  Gingrich also ignores the fact that building the Keystone, by enabling tar sands crude to be exported from the U.S. to higher price gasoline markets in Europe, would actually increase the price of oil in the American Midwest.  How does Newt propose to deliver on his promise? Well, the first thing he promises is to increase the amount of oil the U.S. needs -- by eliminating fuel economy standards, so that Americans can once again be forced to purchase cars they cannot afford to drive. So far, Newt's proposals make us worse off.  Then he wants to open up places like the Arctic Wildlife Refuge to drilling -- unfortunately, the cost of extreme oil from places like the Arctic, once again, is above the $70/b mark, not the $50 Newt needs in his $2/gallon pipe-dream. None of these numbers stop Newt from claiming that, somehow, the U.S. can simply produce enough oil on its own to bring down the price of oil. No serious oil industry figure has stepped forward to validate this craziness. And if you want to see just how implausible it is, look at the following charts:  The first chart shows U.S. oil production relative to world output. Relative to our reserves, we are batting above our league -- we have less than 3 percent of the world's reserves, but produce 7 percent of the world's oil. 

But even a significant increase in U.S. oil production would not make a meaningful dent in the global supply and demand equation -- we are simply too small a part of the total.
The second chart shows what has happened to U.S. oil prices and drilling activity; it shows that as U.S. oil prices rise, so do the number of wells being drilled -- but more wells do not equal lower prices.

So the Drilling crowd's plans -- consume more oil by letting car companies produce more wasteful vehicles, and rely on both U.S. and imported extreme, dirty oil sources to drive down gas prices -- is pure fantasy. Extreme oil plays like the tar sands and remote Arctic require EXPENSIVE, not CHEAP gas.
There is of, course, always the possibility of magic. This seems to be what some of Newt's supporters are counting on.
Texas Governor and former Presidential candidate Rick Perry, for example, commented: 
As a matter of fact, perception is everything in this world we live in, and if the perception is Newt Gingrich could be the next president of the United States, that will have a worldwide effect, I will suggest to you, on the price of oil. 
This absurdity is remiscent of the comments by some Bush administration staffers that ""Empires make their own reality."" But if Newt Gingrich is really Harry Potter in disguise, one imagines he might have dispatched Mitt Romney by now -- Harry certainly would have!
What is the public making of this? Thus far the pattern is quite different than during the oil price spikes of the Bush administration. During that period the public was angrier at both the president and the oil companies -- 25 percent blamed Bush, only 18 percent blame Obama, and the oil company share is down from 31 percent to 14 percent. Far more people haven't made up their mind yet. And most of those who blame Obama are Republicans, so there is no evidence that the Gingrich/Boehner attacks are gaining meaningful traction.
Fox News and the Republicans have now taken to misquoting Energy Secretary Steve Chu has having actually coming out in favor of higher gas prices -- which the record shows never happened. Fox's attack shows that the network seems to be suffering from some form of memory loss, since back in 2008 it defended the Bush administration by arguing that ""no President has the power to increase or to lower gas prices.""
In the short term, of course, that is true. In the longer term, the numbers make it very clear that a U.S. President can influence the costs of gasoline -- not by magically enhancing domestic supply, but by using innovation and efficiency to reduce U.S. -- and therefore world -- demand. Modest reductions in global DEMAND for oil translate into large savings on the COST of oil -- precisely because if the world doesn't need $80/barrel tar sands oil, prices for the conventional, low-cost sources of oil fall, and fall rapidly.
So the next time you hear a presidential candidate talk about the cost of driving, make sure that he understands the ground rules of making it cheap:
Don't waste. A 50 percent improvement in fuel efficiency for vehicles equals BOTH less fuel and cheaper fuel -- it's the equivalent, at least, of cutting the price of gas from $4.00 to $2.00, Newt's stated goal.  No extreme oil allowed. No tar sands, no remote Arctic, no ultra-deep ocean -- these simply cost too much. Find alternatives to oil for liquid fuels. Bio-fuels or vehicle electrification are already cheaper than80 oil, and by driving down demand, also reduced the price/barrel.

Bear has been like a big brother for Maisy, looking out for her. Maisy and Bear spent most of their life severely neglected. They were most likely tied up and left out in the backyard alone. They were never taught how to walk properly on leashes, taken to the vet or fully socialized. Unfortunately for Maisy and Bear, their time was running out at the shelter.

Maisy and Bear spent months at the shelter waiting to be adopted. Maisy was actually adopted three separate times and taken home. Once the adopters got Maisy home, they realized she had an issue with her leg from an old injury that her previous owners neglected. She had never been to the vet. It was heartbreaking to see Maisy returned to the shelter all three times because of her injury. Back at the shelter, Maisy was always greeted by her ol' friend Bear, but was still in pain and without a home. 

Like many Pitty mixes, Bear was never adopted, and soon the shelter no longer had the space for two larger, less adoptable dogs. It seemed that they were waiting for a day that would never come. Maisy and Bear were scheduled to the euthanized. 

Helen, Founder of Creature Kind Foundation noticed Maisy and Bear and called the shelter begging them to hold onto them so that she could come down to the shelter and pull them and foster them. She raced to the shelter to bring them home and saved them from euthanasia. A week later, Maisy had surgery for her leg injury and made a full recovery. An animal behavioral specialist has been working with Bear and Maisy on their leash walking and socialization. 

Now Maisy and Bear have improved greatly, and their personalities are shining through. They get to experience car rides, long walks and love like they have never had before. Most importantly, Maisy and Bear are still together and won't ever have to wait for a home in a shelter again. Creature Kind Foundation recognized what amazing dogs Maisy and Bear were, and decided they were worth saving. Best of all, foster mom Helen has decided to adopt Maisy and Bear so that they can be together forever! What a wonderful ending to the story!

Co-founder of the Maldivian Youth Climate Network",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/maldivian-islands-climate_us_5bb11374e4b09bbe9a5a2ff7,"When people first meet me and find out I am a Maldivian, they often react with a comment about how our country is sinking. This is something I find hard to reply to as it is so real and daunting.",2012-04-22,ENVIRONMENT,"I was brought up with an appreciation of our natural resources and the knowledge that we must not overuse them. From early childhood I learned not to litter for the purpose of doing my bit to keep the place clean. However, it seems like most people take the environment for granted. Simple things like littering are taken with the attitude of ""someone else will clean it,"" or ""out of sight out of mind."" People find it funny to see me hold on to little things like sweet wrappers until I find a dustbin, and they harass me for this kind of attitude, but I have learned to deal with this.
It was about 15 years ago that I first came to know about climate change. The thought of my people losing our homeland is just too daunting. I went through a phase of denial where I did not want to think about it and I just wanted to enjoy life. But I could not just ignore climate change when I started seeing beaches disappear. I was scared when I noticed the increase in frequency and intensity of sea swells, which flood homes and farmland each year.
The Maldivian islands are tiny with an average size of 1.5 square kilometers. More than 80 percent of our islands are less than one meter (or three feet) above sea level. So imagine a three-meter wave crashing on an island so small and flat! With the recent 8.9 magnitude earthquake in Indonesia, a tsunami warning was issued to the Maldives. What concerned me most was our natural lack of preparedness. On national television they were telling people to go to higher ground, but I was thinking to myself, ""What higher grounds do we have?!"" Imagine the panic and helplessness people have when they do not know where to go. We all know there is no safe place for us. I felt so helpless.
I want my kids and grandkids to enjoy the white sandy beaches I have enjoyed so much. I want them to see the beautiful coral reefs with zillions of fishes and marine life, which always put me in a state of awe. My heart sinks these days when I see dead coral reefs, which are now becoming a common sight. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase in the atmosphere, the temperature of the ocean will increase, which means coral reefs will not survive. Coral reefs are our natural defense mechanism to protect our tiny islands from strong waves. They are also the home for the bait fish for tuna fishing, which is our main staple diet and one of our primary sources of income. Food security is a very real issue and an immediate threat for Maldivians, and climate change has worsened this situation. Our white sandy beaches are formed from coral reefs, which tourists love to see. As the coral reefs die, there will be less beaches and less underwater beauty for tourists to come and see, which means we would have lost our main income source. So when coral reefs die, we are doomed. I fear for my country, which God has blessed with natural beauty, but it is also a place with a rich cultural heritage -- my cultural heritage -- which is threatened to be wiped from the earth.
I have come to notice that when international people first meet me and find out I am a Maldivian, they often react with a comment about how our country is sinking. This is something I find hard to reply to as it is so real and daunting that I wish I would not have to think about it at all.
Because our island communities are so small and so far away from each other, politics can become personalized to individual islands. This increases our vulnerability to climate change, which has unfortunately become quite political. The climate change fight, to me, feels like I am struggling to swim and stay above water in an open ocean no matter how tired I am. But just as I learned to deal with the harassment of my peers for not littering, I am learning to deal with the struggles that come with fighting for climate justice. I plead to the world: Do your part to save my islands before it is too late, and before sea level rise impacts others in the future the way it impacts us today. I believe that every little bit counts and I will continue to do whatever I can to save my home.

Concerns have been raised about the treatment of animals in some zoos.
However, special care and consideration is commonly extended to young animals. For example, when baby monkeys, kangaroos and giant anteaters were born at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay earlier this year, keepers housed the young animals with their mothers in a private area of the zoo, away from the eyes of visitors.
Unfortunately, not all animals receive the same love as zoo babies. According to the Humane Society, 3 million to 4 million dogs and cats are euthanized each year in the U.S. alone, and many shelters operate at capacity or struggle with overpopulation. 
If you have pets, make sure to spay or neuter them. If you are thinking about getting a pet, consider the long-term responsibility of pet ownership, and explore adoption options with your local shelter, or by visiting Petfinder.com and the ASPCA website.

A good relationship demands that you listen to your partner. But we, as a society, have not been listening to planet Earth and the signals she is sending.",2012-03-03,ENVIRONMENT,"Last month, I wrote about how we are stuck in a bad relationship with planet Earth.
A good relationship is built on respect.
A good relationship demands that you listen to your partner.
But we, as a society, have not been listening to planet Earth and the signals she is sending. Our relationship with our home is in desperate need of therapy.
One of the ways we can rebuild our relationship with the Earth is to reclaim our role as citizens. We must not allow ourselves to simply consume. Nor allow ourselves to only be defined as consumers.
We need to call for a nation of citizen entrepreneurs: people who love their home, who love the earth, and who can connect the dots regarding the global challenges we face.
On my journey in life, I have been fortunate enough to meet and work with people who connect those dots and take action. One person, Pam Dashiell, was an amazing activist from the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans.

I met Pam after Hurricane Katrina, when I led Global Green on a journey, armed with a vision to help rebuild New Orleans green. We responded to the crisis immediately after the storm, and we were determined to help pave the way for a brighter, greener future.
We set a goal of greening homes, schools, and adopting a neighborhood, while creating sustainable models for climate-friendly communities and cities. In short, forming a response to the threats and realities of climate change.
Pam was with us on this journey. In fact, it was Pam's beloved neighborhood that we adopted, and partnered with: the historic Holy Cross in the Lower 9th Ward. Pam was an advocate for and a beloved leader of her neighborhood.
Pam loved her neighborhood, her home, and planet Earth. And what Pam did for her community was inspiring: She led her neighborhood to make a commitment -- a crazy idea -- to create the first carbon-neutral neighborhood in the United States of America.
Sadly, Pam passed away two years ago. But thanks in great part to her determination and vision, there are more LEED-certified green homes in the Lower Ninth Ward than any other neighborhood in America. It is quite a legacy she left. And she took big steps toward creating that carbon-neutral neighborhood she dreamed about.
So what do we do? How do we mend this bad relationship we are stuck in?
What if we valued and celebrated people like Pam who love their home, who love their neighborhood, who love planet Earth?
And what if Vanity Fair created the new establishment list of citizen entrepreneurs? What if Forbes 400, rather than listing the 400 richest people in America, created the Forbes 400 of citizen entrepreneurs?
I'm not just talking about the people who run nonprofit organizations or CEOs of corporations that have a commitment to social change. I'm talking about people we all know: teachers and nurses; farmers and small business owners; and mothers and fathers in their neighborhood who care and have a crazy idea and do something about it, however big or small.
That's what citizen entrepreneurship is all about.
So, what if we were committed to loving our home, loving our neighborhood, and loving the earth? What if we decided we wanted to listen and make a difference? And we wanted to make sure our relationship with our planet was healthy and strong and built to last?
To be in a good relationship with Mother Earth, we need strong leadership in Washington and in corporate board rooms. And we also need to work at the local level to foster a nation of citizen entrepreneurs.
Maybe you're a citizen entrepreneur? Do you know someone like Pam? A neighbor, classmate, co-worker, friend, or family member -- a local green hero who deserves to be applauded and could benefit from support in their efforts?
We want to shine a light on these local green heroes with Global Green's Citizen Entrepreneur Contest. Nominate someone before March 21 and we will choose 10 finalists before opening up the voting online to the public. A winner to be awarded $1,000 to help fund their green project -- and get a chance to join our delegation to Rio for the UN Earth Summit in June 2012, where we will share the inspiring stories of citizen entrepreneurs on a global stage.
But we don't have to enter a contest to be a citizen entrepreneur -- it's in all of us. The creativity, the resourcefulness, and the can-do attitude. We can all take responsibility for a corner of our world.
Together, we can all reclaim our role as citizens, and mend this bad relationship.

By Gus Trompiz
PARIS, March 12 (Reuters) - The world's water supply is being strained by climate change and the growing food, energy and sanitary needs of a fast-growing population, according to a United Nations study that calls for a radical rethink of policies to manage competing claims.
""Freshwater is not being used sustainably,"" UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova said in a statement. ""Accurate information remains disparate, and management is fragmented ... the future is increasingly uncertain and risks are set to deepen.""
It says that demand from agriculture, which already sucks up around 70 percent of freshwater used globally, is likely to rise by at least 19 percent by 2050 as the world's population swells an estimated 2 billion people to 9 billion.
Farmers will need to grow 70 percent more food by that time as rising living standards mean individuals demand more food, and meat in particular.
The report will be debated at the World Water Forum, which starts in the French city of Marseille on Monday.
A ""silent revolution"" has taken place underground, the report warns, as the amount of water sucked from below the surface has tripled in the past 50 years, removing a buffer against drought.
And just as demand increases, supply in many regions is likely to shrink because of changed rainfall patterns, greater droughts, melting glaciers and altered river flows, it says.
""Climate change will drastically affect food production in South Asia and Southern Africa between now and 2030,"" the report says. ""By 2070, water stress will also be felt in central and southern Europe.""
Asia is home to 60 percent of the world's population but only around a third of water resources, it points out.
A separate water study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) released last week forecast world water demand would rise by 55 percent by 2050, with more than 40 percent of the global population likely to live in water basins facing water stress.
The report says with limited supply, policymakers will have to better manage the competing demands of farmers, energy producers and humans demanding drinking water and sanitation.
""The lack of interaction between the diverse communities of users, decision makers and isolated water managers has caused serious degradation of the water resource,"" it says.
The World Health Organisation said last week the U.N. target to raise the proportion of people with access to safe drinking water by 2015 had actually been reached at the end of 2010.
However the figure was contested by French charity Solidarites International, which said 1.9 billion people remained without safe drinking water, not the 783 million estimated by the United Nations.
The charity is among groups planning to challenge official messages at the Forum, with some associations holding an alternative event in Marseille. (Additional reporting by Jean-Francois Rosnoblet; Editing by Ben Harding)

Those, on the other hand",2013-09-02,ENVIRONMENT,"One of the daily privileges of living in southern California along the Santa Monica Bay is watching pods of bottlenose dolphins patrolling the coastline. They are extraordinary creatures with astounding memories that bring joy to my day - each time I see them.  My students and I believe that dolphins are entitled to the right of life. We along with millions of other Earthlings are mortified that Japan and Faroe Islanders brutally slaughter small-toothed whales and dolphins i.e. Faroe Islands and Taiji Cove with such reckless abandon and a despicable sense of entitlement.
Those unfortunate dolphins not slaughtered but caught are sentenced to an unimaginable captivity - suffering a brutal and torturous existence in dolphinariums for the amusement of unconscious humans. Have you seen the documentary Blackfish?
Since July 1, my colleagues and I have witnessed bottlenose dolphins dying along the eastern seaboard from New York to the Carolina's (and soon predicted along Florida) at ten times the normal death rates, washing ashore emaciated, shark bitten with shocking skin lesions. So far over 375 have perished with predictions suggesting casualties will at least double before a morbillivirus, which is implicated in their deaths, abates.
In addition, it is worrisome that polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs are showing up in high concentrations off-coast Georgia. Although banned in the U.S. since 1979 they remain at manufacturing sites bleeding carcinogenic toxicity into soils and waterways for many decades. 
The truth of the matter is that our oceans are desperately sick; my forthcoming book 'Shepherding the Sea' delves into many of those details. In the meantime, dolphins and whales are in big trouble - naval and oil exploration sonar are shattering their eardrums, cargo ships are ramming them, 13 million miles or 27 return trips to the moon of hooked and monofilament fishing lines are ensnaring them or cutting them badly, their autoimmune systems are so over-compromised from mercury poisoning (a by-product of coal-fired power plants) and toxic micro-plastics acting as sponges laced with high concentrations of potent man-made poisons; these awesome sea creatures are now susceptible to many viruses whereby pneumonia sets in, quickly.
My colleagues have clearly shown that both filter feeding whales e.g. humpbacks and large- and small-toothed whales (i.e. dolphins) play an essential role in keeping the web of sealife intact and vibrant. The filter feeders fertilize the ocean with their nitrogen-rich flocculent fecal plumes, stimulating phytoplankton, enriching the marine ecosystem, and creating abundant fisheries. Toothed whales cull the old and weak fish and seal populations preventing diseases from reaching epidemics and ensuring a high level of fitness throughout the seas.
The Japanese and Faroe Island bloodlust is barbaric and it is fueling the death of the sea - their repugnant sense of entitlement must end, now!
The Japanese government recently called demonstrators in Tokyo 'environmental terrorists' for drawing attention to the beginning of yet another dolphin slaughter season. Shame on them for their incorrigible misuse of the word 'terrorism.'
Those that stand-up for nature and the rights of sealife are intrepid and indeed worthy of praise. Those, on the other hand, that authorize and profit from killing or torturing of nature and the destruction of our living biosphere are perpetrating global crimes against all children and their birthrights on planet Earth.

March 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil on Sunday continued cleanup of a pipeline spill that spewed thousands of barrels of heavy Canadian crude in Arkansas as opponents of oil sands development latched on to the incident to attack plans to build the Keystone XL line.
Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said on Sunday that crews had yet to excavate the area around the pipeline breach, a needed step before the company can estimate how long repairs will take and when the line might restart.
""I can't speculate on when it will happen,"" Jeffers said. ""Excavation is necessary as part of an investigation to determine the cause of the incident.""
Exxon's Pegasus pipeline, which can carry more than 90,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude from Patoka, Illinois to Nederland, Texas, was shut after the leak was discovered late Friday afternoon in a subdivision near the town of Mayflower. The leak forced the evacuation of 22 homes.
Exxon also had no specific estimate of how much crude oil had spilled, but the company said 12,000 barrels of oil and water had been recovered - up from 4,500 barrels on Saturday. The company did not say how much of the total was oil and how much was water.
Allen Dodson, Faulkner County judge who is the top executive for the county where the spill occurred, told Reuters in an interview on Sunday that the smell of crude was less potent on Sunday as cleanup efforts continued, saying it was weaker than the smell of fresh asphalt laid on a road.
""The freestanding oil on the street has been removed. It's still damp with oil, it's tacky, like it is before we do an asphalt overlay,"" he said.
Exxon said it staged the response to handle 10,000 barrels of oil ""to ensure adequate resources are in place.""
Officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) also were on site to investigate the spill.
Fifteen vacuum trucks remained on the scene for cleanup, and 33 storage tanks were deployed to temporarily store the oil.
The pipeline was carrying Canadian Wabasca Heavy crude at the time of the leak. An oil spill of more than 1,000 barrels into a Wisconsin field from an Enbridge Inc pipeline last summer kept that line shuttered for around 11 days.
The 848-mile (1,381 km) pipeline used to transport crude oil from Texas to Illinois. In 2006 Exxon reversed it to move crude from Illinois to Texas in response to growing Canadian oil production and the ability of U.S. Gulf Coast refineries to process heavy crude.
The Arkansas spill drew fast reaction from opponents of the 800,000 bpd Keystone XL pipeline, which also would carry heavy crude from Canada's tar sands to the Gulf Coast refining hub.
Environmentalists have expressed concerns about the impact of developing the oil sands and say the crude is more corrosive to pipelines than conventional oil. On Wednesday, a train carrying Canadian crude derailed in Minnesota, spilling 15,000 gallons of oil.
""Whether it's the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, or ... (the) mess in Arkansas, Americans are realizing that transporting large amounts of this corrosive and polluting fuel is a bad deal for American taxpayers and for our environment,"" said Representative Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat.
Supporters of Keystone XL and oil sands development say the vast Canadian reserves can help drive down fuel costs in the United States. A report from the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, put together by oil and gas consultancy Penspen, argued diluted bitumen is no more corrosive than other heavy crude.
A year ago Exxon won a court appeal to charge market rates on the Pegasus line, or rates that are not capped and that can change along with market conditions without prior approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
That decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington D.C. said the Pegasus pipeline is now the ""primary avenue"" to move Canadian crude oil to the Gulf Coast. The ruling also said Exxon moves about 66,000 barrels per day on the line.
Last week PHMSA proposed that Exxon pay a $1.7 million fine over pipeline safety violations stemming from a July 2011 oil spill from its Silvertip pipeline in the Yellowstone River. The line, which carries 40,000 barrels per day in Montana, leaked about 1,500 barrels of crude after heavy flooding in the area.
Exxon has 30 days from the March 25 order to contest those violations.
According to PHMSA, the U.S. has 2.3 million miles of pipelines.
CLEANUP
Exxon said that by 3 a.m. Saturday there was no additional oil spilling from the pipeline and that trucks had been brought in to assist with the cleanup. Images from local media showed crude oil snaking along a suburban street and spewed across lawns.
Twenty-two homes in the affected subdivision remained evacuated on Sunday, though Mayflower police were providing escorts for residents to temporarily return to retrieve personal items.
Jeffers said a couple of homes ""appear to have small amounts of oil on their foundations,"" but he had no information on damage estimates or claims. Exxon had established a claims hotline for affected residents and said about 50 claims had been made so far.
Dodson said oil that made it to the street went into storm drains that eventually lead to a cove connected to nearby Lake Conway, known as a fishing lake stocked with bass, catfish, bream and crappie.
He said local responders that included firemen, city employees, county road crews, police quickly built dikes of dirt and rock to block culverts along that path that stopped crude from fouling the lake.
""We were just in the nick of time,"" he said.
Exxon later deployed 3,600 feet of boom near the lake as a precaution.
Dodson said crude also got into several homeowners' yards, which will take longer to clean up.
""We've just gotten used to having pipelines go through cities and counties, and you hope something like this doesn't happen. My heart goes out to all of the people personally impacted,"" Dodson said.

They can go to the website and create a local food event and it will be in our global event listings for the public to attend. It can be an event for five people or for 50, and the more creative the better. We hope that this will inspire future projects at a grassroots level and connect neighbors who can support each other in standing up for real food,” Oliver says. “The other way that people can get involved is to host their own dinner party. There will be people in over 45 countries around the world hosting their own dinner parties in support of food education.”  For Oliver, who sums up his food philosophy as “Better food, better life,” has made it his life’s mission “to get people to eat real food, made from scratch. I believe — and research has shown — that by eating a diet of real food (meats and vegetables, carbohydrates and the occasional treat) that you cook for yourself and your family will make you a healthier person. When I look around the world at the rising rates of obesity and diet-related disease, I am saddened and angered because this is entirely preventable. People just need food education and a few cooking skills.”  He’s proud that his television programs and campaign initiatives have produced tangible results and inspired people to make changes in their lives.  “After ‘Jamie’s School Dinners’ aired in the U.K., the people petitioned the government to serve better food to our children and they actually listened and voted more than $500 million into the system. In America, after the ‘Food Revolution’ aired, we inspired people to petition against flavored milk and pink slime in our schools, which not only got the USDA to change the regulations around flavored milk, but led fast-food companies and grocery stores to stop selling pink slime.”  Although he encountered bureaucratic red tape and resistance while making “Food Revolution,” he nevertheless considers it a win. “Just getting the ‘Food Revolution’ series on national prime time television was an accomplishment, but then to have the entire town of Huntington [West Virginia] transform and getting Los Angeles on the journey is a huge deal. We've started a national dialog around food issues that many more people in America are participating in part because of exposure to our shows and campaigns. And winning an Emmy was pretty cool, too.”  Currently, Oliver is running a restaurant empire that includes “Three Fifteens, one Barbecoa next to St. Paul’s Cathedral in London, two Union Jacks with Chris Bianco, and 31 Jamie’s Italians, which I hope to bring to the USA at some point.” His latest print effort is the U.S. version of “Jamie’s Great Britain,” due out in October. “It is my love letter to British food, and I am hoping after everyone falls in love with the country after the Summer Olympics that they will want to give the food a try too,” he says.   As a father of four, Oliver keeps the food he serves at home and at his restaurants local, sustainable and impeccably sourced. “A lot of what we eat at home comes straight from the garden so that helps, particularly from this time of year right through until Christmas when there's plenty to harvest. As for the restaurants, we source everything very carefully so we know all about the food provenance. We go to all the farms to check on the animal welfare and we always use higher welfare chicken, for example.”  Looking ahead, he plans to “keep doing what I’m doing, raising my family, writing books, making telly, and making noise around issues that I believe in,” Oliver says. He has a simple solution for improving the food situation, and it starts with us. “Demand better,” he says. “More fresh, less processed. More access to good fresh food and food education so that the lovely people at home actually know what to do with a fresh vegetable.”  Get inspired: Learn about others who are making a difference with MNN's Innovation Generation project.

By Kaija Wilkinson
MOBILE, Ala., Dec 25 (Reuters) - A major winter storm system swept through the southern United States on Tuesday, spawning tornadoes in several states and killing two people in weather-related road accidents.
The National Weather Service (NWS) said a tornado struck Mobile, Alabama, home to about 200,000 people, at about 5 p.m. local time (2300 GMT). There were reports of damage to trees and widespread power outages, along with some structural damage, but no injuries or fatalities.
Tornadoes also touched down in Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana, flattening houses and causing some injuries, according to the NWS.
The wild Christmas weather was expected to continue into early Wednesday - the NWS' Storm Prediction Center forecasted the development of ""a few strong tornadoes and thunderstorm wind damage over parts of the southeast"" this evening and overnight.
It warned that tornadoes at night at this time of year can be particularly dangerous because they are usually fast-moving and obscured by rain and darkness. Areas mostly likely to be hit by strong storms include southern and eastern Alabama, the Florida Panhandle and southwest Georgia, the NWS warned.
Tuesday's storms also contributed to a 21-vehicle pile-up that shut down a major highway in Oklahoma City and tens of thousands of power outages.
A Texas man died after an accident involving a tree in the road, and another person died in a weather-related accident on I-44 in Oklahoma, according to local authorities.
The storm was expected to evolve into a blizzard from Arkansas to southern Illinois on Tuesday night, with snowfall of up to a foot (30.5 cm) in some areas, according to Accuweather.com.
Accuweather.com senior meteorologist Kristina Pydynowski warned on the website that travel will be ""extremely treacherous, if not impossible, as the snow clogs roads, such as interstates 24, 55 and 57, and the blowing snow severely lowers visibility.""
The Indiana governor's office issued an advisory Tuesday evening that ""non-essential employees"" who live in areas where snow emergencies have been declared do not have to come to work.
The snowstorm will shift on Wednesday to the eastern Great Lakes and northeastern region, with a blizzard warning in effect for Cleveland starting at 7 a.m. on Wednesday (1200 GMT), forecasters said. Cleveland could get up to a foot of snow, according to the NWS.
Southern Indiana is under a blizzard warning starting early Wednesday morning, according to NWS meteorologist Crystal Pettet. Indianapolis could see its biggest snowfall in four years, with a possibility of 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30.5 cm) of snow.
""Conditions should be pretty bad in time for rush hour,"" Pettet said. 
CHRISTMAS SNOWFALL
In the town of McNeill in southern Mississippi, an apparent tornado destroyed 12 homes and injured eight people, though none of the injuries appear life-threatening, said Danny Manley, director of the Pearl River County Emergency Management Agency.
Manley said the homes could not be rebuilt, as some had lost roofs and their top stories and one was smashed by a tree.
Another apparent tornado hit Centreville, Mississippi, in the southwestern part of the state, injuring one person, destroying a trailer and heavily damaging other homes and buildings, according to Tim Destri, a NWS meteorologist in New Orleans.
A tornado destroyed a building 13 miles (21 km) southeast of Crockett, Texas, and a bank lost a section of its roof, according to Accuweather.com.
Freezing drizzle overnight led to 10 separate collisions on Interstate 40 in Oklahoma City early on Tuesday, said Betsy Randolph, a spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. The city also got a rare Christmas snowfall.
The 21-vehicle pile-up included three tractor-trailers and shut down the westbound lanes for about five hours, she said. Twelve people were taken to hospitals, and troopers were checking on the severity of their injuries.
Ahead of the storm's path, parts of eastern West Virginia are under a winter storm warning. Ice accumulations of up to half an inch (1.25 cm) are expected in higher elevations, the NWS said.

In Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, Kentucky",2013-06-02,ENVIRONMENT,"From Mother Nature Network's Tom Oder:
A new generation of chefs is taking the farm-to-table trend in local sourcing and sustainability to a new level of culinary inspiration. Call them America’s foraging chefs. They are collecting locally available plants in environmentally responsible ways and serving them in sync with the seasons in a style that belies the plants’ often-unassuming appearance and origins.  Six of these chefs, a farmer and a few friends threaded their way through Atlanta’s rush-hour traffic early one morning in late April and headed for the mountains of North Georgia. Their destination was a mountainside deep in the Cohutta Wilderness that Drew Belline, chef and co-owner of the Italian-inspired restaurant 246 in Decatur and the expedition leader, had foraged before. If his timing was right, he vowed the site would be covered with ramps (Allium tricoccum).
 Chef Drew Belline led the expedition to pick ramps in the Cohutta Wilderness in the North Georgia mountains. They hit the mother lode, a hillside with thousands of the plants.
Ramps are variably known as spring onions, wild leeks, wood leeks and wild garlic. They are the first green vegetable to emerge in the spring in much of North America and are harvested at a time when many farmers are still putting in their crops.
The little plants, which only grow about a foot tall, have an underground bulb, a stalk and a pair of bright green leaves. Timing is everything with ramps, Belline said. There is a short window of only a few weeks when they are at an optimum size and flavor for harvesting, he explained. Arrive too early, and the ramps are too small. Wait too late, and the leaves turn yellow and the taste becomes bitter.
Harvested at the right time, though, ramps have a much-sought-after pungent flavor that ranges from a taste like onions for some to garlicky for others. For all palates, however, the appeal that sets them apart from their cultivated cousins — leeks, scallions or chives — is the earthy overtone of the rich humus of the leaf-littered forest floor from which they are collected.
Ramps are especially popular in Appalachian communities along the East Coast. In Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, Kentucky, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, West Virginia and even into Canada, mountain folk hold festivals to celebrate this springtime treat. There’s even a National Ramp Association.  It was this popularity that was on the mind of Belline as he led the chef caravan to the little town of Blue Ridge and then far into the North Georgia mountains. Belline was hoping the locals hadn’t beaten him to the site. He was also hoping he had timed the trip correctly. He decided to go later this year than last because he thought the damp, cool spring the Southeast has experienced this year would delay the ramps’ emergence and growth.  Joining Belline and sharing his hopes were five of Atlanta’s top chefs: Holly Chute, the executive chef at the Georgia Governor’s Mansion; Todd Mussman, chef and co-owner of Atlanta’s Local Three and Muss and Turners in suburban Smyrna; Colin Miles, butcher and charcuterist at Leon's Full Service, a gastropub a few doors down from 246; Andrew Isabella, Belline’s chef de cuisine; and Hector Santiago, chef at the recently closed Pura Vida, which offered Latin American food with a Peruvian flair.
 Loaded down with ramps, farmer Jonathan Szecsey (from left) and chefs Hector Santiago and Andrew Isabella approach the trailhead after a nearly mile-long, uphill climb.  After twisting, winding and grinding their way along a paved road that became a gravel road that gave way to dirt, the chefs piled into the bed of Belline’s four-wheel drive truck. Family cars are not designed for what lay ahead — a final jolting ascent up a steep and deeply rutted Forest-Service-type dirt road to a trailhead.  Taking off single file down the narrow trail that at some points looked more like a wash littered with loose rocks than a path, the chefs made their way almost a mile into the forest. Finally the trail came to an opening where the sun, filtering through the still-forming spring tree canopy, lit up the emerald-green leaves of the ramps like a beacon. It was the mother lode. Thousands of ramps, more than it was possible to count, hugged the steep slope of the forest floor.  The chefs fanned out and silently went to work with a variety of tools that in some cases looked more like Medieval weapons than implements for digging vegetables. Prying the prized ramps from the loose earth, they packed them into backpacks, woven baskets and tote bags. By the time they were finished, they had made such a tiny dent in the dense growth of ramps that it wasn’t even apparent they had been there.  Once back in Atlanta, this first spring vegetable, which could easily have gone unnoticed by the casual hiker, has turned up on plates from the Governor’s Mansion to fine restaurants to gastropubs. They’ve been served in a variety of ways, including in a sauté with chicken, mushrooms and white wine over brown basmati rice and in a sauté with lemon, wine and pasta. They have been made into a jelly that will be served with sheep or goat cheese and some have been turned in a ramp kimchee that, when it finishes fermenting, will be served with grilled meats to Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal.  Foraging is not for chefs only. It’s also a great way for home gardeners and cooks to combine a love of nature, gardening and cooking. But, before setting out on a foraging expedition, there are some basic guidelines to be aware of. Here are some ""do's"" and ""don'ts"" about foraging to help ensure a safe experience when visiting wild areas near your home and when serving your harvests to friends or family.
Foraging do's
Know what is edible and what is not. Never guess about whether a plant is poisonous. When foraging, consider taking two bags, a ""sure"" bag for the plants you know are safe and an “unsure” bag for those you aren’t sure about.Find a mentor. Find an experienced forager you can trust to give you tips about what, when and where to forage and who can identify plants in your “unsure” bag.Learn what grows where. If you are looking for ramps in Georgia, don’t search for them along a coastal floodplain. In the South, ramps are mountain plants.
Learn about the non-edible plants that grow with edible plants. These are called companion plants. A forager looking for morel mushrooms along the Missouri River, for instance, would want to be extra vigilant if he or she came upon Jack-in-the-pulpits, May-apples, phlox or ferns. These plants and morels prefer a similar combination of soil, slope, moisture and sunlight and often colonize the same sites.
Learn about look-a-likes. Lily-of-the-valley is similar in appearance to ramps. One way to tell the difference is the fragrance of the plants. Ramps have a pungent odor of garlic. Lily-of-the-valley has no odor.
Know your Latin. Because common names can vary widely and some wild edible plants share the same common names as poisonous plants, it’s a good idea to know the Latin name of the plants you are foraging. This is not as intimidating as it may sound. Chances are you are foraging for only a few specific plants. It won’t de difficult to learn their Latin, or botanical, names. These are reliable names that will not change except for those occasions when taxonomists reclassify plants.
Consider growing wild edible plants at home. Wild plant populations are under threat from diminished habitat and over collecting. If your garden conditions match the habitat needs of wild edibles you like, try growing them in your home garden.
Get permission to forage. Foraging on private land without permission can result in unwanted confrontations and even legal problems. Also, asking for permission to forage is a matter of courtesy.
Let friends or family know you are foraging. Accidents can happen. If you are going to be in a remote area, it’s a good idea to let someone know where that area is and when you expect to return.
Be aware of hunting seasons. Take the time to find out if the area you plan to forage is open to hunting. In any case, consider wearing a reflecting vest.
Use all of your senses. Don't limit yourself to visual ID alone. Lots of wild edible plants have look-a-likes. Learn how to differentiate similar plants by smell, feel, texture, etc. 
Learn to follow wild edible plants through all seasons. Some plants, like pokeweed, emerge in the spring but are not identifiable until warm months when they are past their point of use. If you note where pokeweed is in the summer, you’ll know where to find it next spring.
Learn which parts of a wild edible plant are safe to use. Some plants are only edible at certain times of the year. For example, stinging nettle shouldn't be used after it goes to seed.
Foraging don'ts
Take too much. Even if the population of plants you are harvesting seems abundant, be mindful that you likely will not be the only person to forage there. Be realistic about what you can use and never take more than that.Harvest protected plants. For one thing, depending on the plant, it may be illegal. For another, a plant that may appear plentiful in one location may be rare throughout its range. Collect the entire plant if you only need its leaves. If you want sassafras leaves to make a filé powder, there’s no reason to dig up a young tree.Harvest in toxic areas. Areas along busy roads are susceptible to residue from toxic car exhausts and from pesticides sprayed by road crews. If you are going to forage along a stream, know the water source. Avoid collecting plants located near streams that may be contaminated by chemicals and metals from the discharge of nearby manufacturing facilities.Forage plants that don’t appear to be healthy. Plants can be afflicted by disease, fungi, pests or pollution. Harvesting only healthy plants minimizes the risk of illness and also means you're getting more nutritious food.
What are your foraging experiences and what “do's” and “don’ts” about foraging would you add to our list?

While Portugal gets the limelight this week, unmistakably gigantic surf on Oahu’s North Shore has been ridden without technicality squabbles for decades. Each winter, swells reaching Oahu regularly create waves in the 20-30 foot range, occasionally 40-60 feet, and perhaps even 85-feet at the outer reefs.

* May need economic rethink of GDP, CO2 growth-study
By Alister Doyle
OSLO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Greenhouse gas emissions rise when economies expand but don't fall as quickly when recession strikes, perhaps because people stick with a higher-emitting lifestyle from the boom times, a study showed.
The report in Monday's edition of the journal Nature Climate Change dents many governments' hopes that recession can at least bring the consolation of a sharp contraction in greenhouse gas emissions.
Emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, rose by an average of 0.73 percent for every 1 percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, Richard York of the University of Oregon wrote in his report.
But emissions fell just 0.43 percent for every percent decline in GDP per capita, he added, based on a review of World Bank statistics of more than 150 nations from 1960 to 2008.
""Economic decline ... doesn't lead to as big a decline in emissions as a comparable amount of economic growth leads to growth in emissions,"" York told Reuters.
He said the difference might be because new infrastructure added during times of economic growth - new homes, roads or factories - is still used during recession. Carbon dioxide is mainly emitted by burning fossil fuels. 
RE-THINK
""When economies decline, factories don't shut down immediately, people don't stop driving (although they may defer buying a new car),"" he wrote in a email. And many new buildings still needed heating or air-conditioning.
Even since 1990, when many developed nations started trying to curb their greenhouse gases under a U.N. treaty, emissions had also fallen less in recession than they rose when the economy grew, he said.
York said economists may have to re-think how they project future growth of carbon dioxide. Most studies assume that GDP and emissions move in lockstep, both up and down.
The findings ""don't necessarily suggest future emissions will generally be higher or lower than current projections, but they suggest that this will depend more sensitively on how exactly economies grow (or shrink),"" he said.
""It doesn't only matter how big GDP is in the future, but also how it gets there, such as by slow steady growth, or by periods of rapid growth mixed with recession,"" he said.
Almost 200 nations are aiming to agree a new global pact to combat climate change by 2015 that would enter into force in 2020. World leaders failed to agree a new deal at the last attempt, at the Copenhagen summit in 2009.
The U.N. panel of climate scientists says the build-up of greenhouse gases is raising temperatures and will bring more floods, droughts, heatwaves, dust storms and rising sea levels.
Its scenarios foresee the world economy expanding steadily to anywhere from $235 trillion to $550 trillion by 2100, from $21 trillion in 1990. That would raise world temperatures by between 1.1 and 6.4 degrees Celsius (2.0-11.5F), it says.
The world economy is expected to grow by 3.5 percent in 2012, including a 0.3 percent contraction in the euro zone, according to the International Monetary Fund. (Reporting by Alister Doyle; Editing by Mark Potter)

As,2014-01-25,ENVIRONMENT,"From Mother Nature Network's Chanie Kirschner:
The better question might be: do animals get married in the first place? As a whole, animals are largely a promiscuous group, with only a very select species choosing to mate with only one partner over a lifetime. As a matter of fact, more than 90 percent of the animal kingdom mates with multiple partners. Most animals do not actually choose one mate for a long time — or even a short time, for that matter. Most animals just mate with each other and move on.  Some interesting ones to note: Bees, for example. Queen bees can mate with anywhere from one to more than 40 partners. Worker bees actually prefer a more promiscuous queen. And by mating with so many partners, the queen increases the genetic diversity of her offspring. (This is one of the main reasons that animals choose multiple partners to begin with.) Oddly enough, after a male bee mates with the queen, he dies.  Another promiscuous animal is the bonobo chimpanzee, which mates in all sorts of positions, with multiple partners, both male and female. Bonobo chimpanzees are famous for the frequency of their mating, as well as the many creative ways in which they do the deed.  But there are a few animals that mate with each other for life, or at least a very long time. One such animal is the wolf, with a typical wolf pack consisting of a father, a mother, and their young, similar to a human family.  Others on the short list of animals that are (mostly) monogamous: Swans, black vultures, prairie voles, termites, turtle doves, and a parasitic worm with a name that I can’t spell or pronounce.  So do the animals that choose a lifelong partner ever say sayonara to that mate? It seems that they do. Just last year, in the Reptilian Zoo Happ in Austria, the world’s oldest married animal couple, a pair of giant tortoises, started fighting with each other – 115 years after their first date! Now some of you might be saying, ""It’s about time!"" but scientists told zoo staff that animals splitting up after that long of a union is rare.  How did they know something was up? The female tortoise began attacking the male tortoise for no apparent reason (no surprise there). They have since been split up into different habitats, and last I checked the zoo staff was hoping for reconciliation (since tortoises can live up to 150 years). One trick they tried to get them back together was to get another female tortoise to live with Poldi (the male) to make Bibi (the female) jealous. No dice though. She didn’t seem to care all that much.  Another species that typically mates for life is the gibbon, which forms very strong pair bonds. These animals often spend much of their time together, grooming each other, and hanging out in the trees. Alas, recent gibbon research has shown that the home life of these primates is not as idyllic as it seems, with mates occasionally cheating on each other.  So there you have it folks, animals can indeed get divorced, though not many animals get ""married"" to one partner in the first place. Except for a few species, monogamy — and divorce — is mostly a human thing.

359,ENVIRONMENT,Photographer Captures Waves of Trash in Indonesia,Gabriela Aoun,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trash-waves-indonesia_us_5bb14004e4b09bbe9a5d39cd,"“It was crazy. I kept seeing noodle packets floating next to me,” Noyle told GrindTV. “It was very disgusting to be in there",2013-08-10,ENVIRONMENT,"Waves for days. Trash for eternity. That’s what photographer Zak Noyle discovered on a recent trip to Java, Indonesia. The waves of Java, always known for being pristine and barreling, were now rolling swells of disgusting trash and debris. 
Noyle was shooting Indonesian surfer Dede Surinaya in a remote bay when he and Surinaya discovered the water to be covered in garbage, according to GrindTV. The bay was miles from any town, yet strong currents had carried the trash of the world’s most populated island, Java, to its once pure waters. 
“It was crazy. I kept seeing noodle packets floating next to me,” Noyle told GrindTV. “It was very disgusting to be in there; I kept thinking I would see a dead body of some sort for sure.”

In addition to the sea of plastic, large objects like tree trunks were being tossed around in the waves. 
Indonesia, a country comprised of more than 17,000 islands, suffers from a terrible trash problem that is polluting its waters. Some of the population centers have little to no trash collection infrastructure, leading locals to dispose of their waste in the street or in river beds, after which it inevitably is washed out to sea.
Often, the only other disposal option Indonesians have is burning their trash. Incinerating waste creates equally harmful (albeit less visible) damage to the environment. According to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, the byproducts of burned waste “produce a variety of toxic discharges to the air, water and ground that are significant sources of a range of powerful pollutants. Many of these toxins enter the food supply.”

Residents of large population centers are often the ones improperly disposing of their trash, which storms and currents carry to beaches and islands most locals have never even seen. ""There is little cultural awareness when it comes to trash,” according to Time magazine.
But Anna Cummins, co-founder of 5 Gyres, a non-profit that sails the world researching plastic pollution, told The Huffington Post that lack of awareness is not always to blame. “We met many people who would like to do the right thing, but simply don't have access to basic waste removal/disposal. The stench of burning plastic is ever present. The juxtaposition of incredible natural beauty with the blight pollution in Bali was heartbreaking.”

No matter who is to blame, the effects are felt by those who live in or visit Indonesia. Mark Lukach, a writer for the surf website The Inertia, described his first time visiting the island of Lombok. 
“My boyhood fantasy felt disappointingly ruined,"" he wrote. ""I couldn’t believe it. Trash in the lineup. And not any lineup. A lineup right out of my imagination – the perfect lineup … spoiled by trash.”

360,FIFTY,The Thing Nobody Ever Tells You About Sex In Middle Age,"Robin Korth, ContributorInternational author and speaker",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sex-after-50-no-one-talks-about_b_7687314.html,"I don't have a partner in my life right now. But when this special man does show up, I won't be able to be sexually intimate without pain and days-after discomfort, unless my body is being helped along with the enhancing effects of this daily medication.",2015-07-06,VOICES," My cell phone makes a ""chirpy bird"" sound every morning at 6:10 a.m. This is a reminder for me to take my daily dose of a special estrogen that targets the tissues of my vagina. This jolt of hormones repairs what menopause has taken -- the elasticity, welcoming moistures, sexual readiness and accommodation that for so many years were an unquestioned part of my being a woman.
I don't have a partner in my life right now. But when this special man does show up, I won't be able to be sexually intimate without pain and days-after discomfort, unless my body is being helped along with the enhancing effects of this daily medication. You see, this sex after 50 that everyone is yammering about, isn't only about blue pills and super lube. It's not that simple. At least for me -- and as many as 75 percent of all women over 50.
My libido is still energetic and awake, and my interest in male companionship is still right here and very much alive. My hips can gyrate, my toes can curl, my arms wrap and my lips know what to do. So, you'd think I'd be ready to jump right into the freedom and experimentation of sex after 50 that is now being touted and spouted all over the place. This sounds wonderful and good, but it just isn't working for me. Why? Because I find that something very different is going on. I am an older version of myself. I've changed psychologically and my body's changed physically. And with these changes, my desires have changed as well.
A greater attention and care is now required for me to have a healthy and enriching sex life. I can no longer simply let my body take over and worry about my heart later. There's also a whole new level of exposure to being intimate with someone now. Because in opening my body, I am also opening up a larger feel for who I am -- one that I wasn't even capable of in my 20s, 30s, and 40s. I've lived longer. My knowing is wider; as is my history of pain, loss, understanding, purpose and love. My heart and mind have too many facets and avenues for me to play the ""we've had a few dates, so it's time for sex"" game that is so often implied or expected in the land of after-50 dating.
Sure, I've had lovers over these last nine years since my marriage ended at age 51. We've had that spark. We liked one another, we laughed in eager passion and a jumping of bones. And we managed to make things work -- his part A and my part B. We both hit our stride and made it to the finish line, but there were the age-driven difficulties of Mother Nature demanding her due. My body no longer flows into instant action when my sex drive is titillated, so my sexuality isn't the easy ""bridge"" to intimacy that it once was. There is also a deeply personal and unspoken ""price"" for sex after 50.
I can't pretend that things are always ready-set-go in the bedroom anymore. I can't pretend that going to bed is just a sassy wink and a happy bouncing of butts anymore. Without conscious consideration -- those pills every morning and some other inside-me preparation -- my older flesh can experience pain and sustain damage during sex.
As a post-menopausal woman, my vagina simply doesn't work the way it used to. The welcoming walls that have pushed children into this world are now more like tissue paper than a cushiony and stretchy glove. So, no matter how much lubricant is applied, my womanly parts don't as readily accommodate sexual activity as they once did. The confusing part is that the damage that happens during the joy of sex may not be apparent, or even felt, for as much as 18 to 36 hours after I've been with my partner.
There can be tearing and abrasion as I am panting in loving lust and accepting the beat of my partner's passion within me; and this hurt can have a two- to five-day price tag of burning, continuous need to urinate and terrible discomfort. More than a few times, I've slept on the toilet because I could not contain my urge to go and didn't want to wet the bed.
Fearing this pain and possible hurt -- the price of sex after 50 -- can cause hesitation in bed; which then leads to less readiness, more dryness and tightening, and a mental mindset that is anything but relaxed and uninhibited. I've found that these difficulties are all surmountable, but it requires medication, brave communication and very specific self-care. Having ""female-friendly"" prescription coverage or a wallet that can take an added hit of $250 to $400 each month is also required.
The changes in my body have slowed me down and caused me to be much more aware of what I am doing in the sex department. This isn't a bad thing at all. It's actually a powerful gift. Because my body is now asking that I consciously and self-lovingly consider what I really want and need within the physical part of my relationship with a man.
What I want now is a potent intimacy of mind and heart long before we get to folding down the sheets. Without the freedom and trust that comes from truly knowing someone, I won't feel comfortable telling my partner things and showing him things -- about me and about my body -- that are now necessary for me to experience vibrant and satisfying sex.
When I am able to reveal the intimate care and attention that my changing body demands and deserves, I invite my partner to do the same with me -- in courageous honesty, kindness, and generous love. And in doing this, a new vitality and understanding of loving and love-making is opening up for me in these surprisingly beautiful years of my life past 50.

361,FIFTY,Why Bangkok Is One Of The World's Best Retirement Spots,"Kathleen Peddicord, ContributorPublisher, Live and Invest Overseas",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/retire-to-bangkok_b_6653708.html,"More expats live in Bangkok than in any other city in Southeast Asia. Who would retire to Bangkok? To answer that question, you need to spend some time here. Your first impressions of Bangkok likely will be that this is a huge city with some tourist attractions. If you stick around, though, your perception will change.",2015-02-27,VOICES,"
More expatriates live in Bangkok, Thailand than in any other city in Southeast Asia. 
Bangkok has a population of roughly eight million people; about 25 percent of them are citizens from other countries, including the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Germany, Australia, and Japan. About a third of the total Western population of the city is American. Many of these Western foreigners are teaching English or earning a living otherwise. However, there's also a sizable population of Western retirees in Bangkok.
Who would retire to Bangkok?
To answer that question, you need to spend some time here. Your first impressions of Bangkok likely will be that this is a huge, sprawling city with some tourist attractions and a lot of bars. If you stick around a while, though, your perception of Bangkok likely will change. 
One thing that any retiree can appreciate is the low cost of living in this city. Relatively cheap rent, bargain street food, and inexpensive transportation add up to an overall very affordable cost of living. If you don't mind a simple lifestyle, you can get by on a budget of less than $1,000 per month. If your nest egg stretches to $3,000 per month, you could like royalty in this city.
The quality of the medical care is another big benefit for retirees to Bangkok. Internationally accredited hospitals and clinics provide state-of-the-art care at prices that are a fraction the cost of comparable Western healthcare; on average Bangkok costs are about 20 percent of U.S. costs. Thailand sees more medical tourists than any other country in the world. Forty hospitals and clinics in the country that have received Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation, and 25 of those are located in Bangkok. 
In addition, retired to Bangkok, you'd be on the doorstep of dozens of golf courses and some of the nicest beaches in Thailand. This is a truly international city, meaning you can get most anything you might want from most anywhere in the world. Whatever you're pining for, you'll have no trouble satisfying your food whims. 

Foreigners in Bangkok can tap into a developed infrastructure of resources and support. Expats gather often, in many places, and for many reasons, formal and informal. Magazines such as Time Out Bangkok and Sukhumvit Scene include extensive listings of restaurants, festivals, concerts, and events around town, and Internet resources such as ThaiVisa provide timely local information. Retired here, you'd have access to top-quality international schools, libraries, concerts, and festivals.
Living in Bangkok, you'd find your new neighbors to be exceptionally pleasant. Thailand is famous as ""The Land of Smiles,"" and you'll be impressed with how well Bangkok lives up to that reputation. 
Furthermore, it's now easy for a retiree to obtain a long-stay retirement visa in Thailand. Border runs are history.
Bangkok has a lot going for it, but there are potential drawbacks to take into account before considering the idea of retiring here. Bangkok is big. This is a major city, more chaotic than most. It takes a bit of effort to get out to the peaceful farmlands, deserted beaches, or quiet, open spaces. 
Second, Bangkok's tropical climate can be uncomfortable. This is one of the warmest cities in the world, hot and humid year-round. 
Third, more coup d'états have occurred in Thailand than in any other country in the world. Since 1932, there have been 11 successful coups and another seven attempted coups. The most recent successful coup was in 2014, resulting in a change of government from Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to a military junta headed by General Prayut Chan-o-cha. The military regime has promised a return to a democratic government, and a general election may occur by February 2016.
Should this history of political unrest bother you? You have to answer that question for yourself. I know many American expats, including retirees, who are living either full- or part-time in Bangkok, who have been in the city during times of coup, who have never experienced any trouble or concern personally, and who have no intention of leaving. They love their lives in this unique and exciting city, one of the most cosmopolitan in the region.

The name Bangkok is actually a Western nickname. The original village that was called Bangkok centuries ago no longer exists. Modern Bangkok's proper Thai name is Krung thep mahanakhon amorn ratanakosin mahintharayutthaya mahadilok popnoparat ratchathani burirom udomratchanivetmahasathan amornpiman avatarnsathit sakkathattiyavisnukarmprasit, which, according to the Guinness Book of Records, is the longest location name in the world. In English, this translates into ""The city of angels, the great city, the residence of the Emerald Buddha, the impregnable city of Ayutthaya of God Indra, the grand capital of the world endowed with nine precious gems, the happy city, abounding in an enormous Royal Palace that resembles the heavenly abode where reigns the reincarnated god, a city given by Indra and built by Vishnukarn."" 
Thais simply refer to their capital city as Krung Thep, or the ""City of Angels.""

At first I hesitated to do this because I thought it would be depressing and remind me of my life partner, Ed, who passed away with Alzheimer's several years ago. But it hasn't been depressing at all except a little bit the first time. I also thought I would feel devastated if any of the ladies I visited died. Well, two have died so far. I am very sad that they passed away but I can't honestly say I'm devastated.
I have always heard people say that when doing this kind of volunteer work you receive far more than you give. I never believed them. But I have to tell you that in my case it has been very true. No matter what mood I'm in when I arrive I always feel better when I leave. Honestly!
Knowing of my interest in, and numerous publications about, Alzheimer' caregiving, both the facility administration and I thought it would be a snap. I would be the supreme visitor. (I've even published an article about visiting people with Alzheimer's.)
I'm embarrassed to say, however, that I've made many mistakes over the months. In fact, I'd say I deserved an ""F"" in visiting, especially in the beginning. I have learned that knowing what to do and actually doing it can be two very different things. 
I'm going to put a list of my mistakes here, hoping it may be of help to others. 
1. I didn't think to explain to any of the ladies who I was and why I was there. Two were alert and curious enough to ask me. The third just seemed sort of confused about my presence.
2. I gave Nancy (not her real name) three instructions in one sentence. When I told her I was there to visit with her, she asked me how we went about that. I said, ""First we go down to your room, then we sit down, and then we visit a while."" (No wonder she didn't want to visit with me!) She couldn't possibly have remembered those three items.  3. While we were walking to Nancy's room I talked to her from behind, a clear ""no no."" She couldn't hear me well and didn't even know I was talking to her.
4. I didn't observe that Nancy was getting seriously agitated when I played Elvis for her and I didn't stop playing it, as I should have.
5. I have asked each of the three at least once if they remember some specific person or event. That only confuses them and makes them feel bad if they can't remember.
6. I corrected Carolyn when she told me she didn't have a daughter. She had previously told me about her daughter, so I reminded her of that. She was needlessly embarrassed.
7. I consistently forget to address them frequently using their names. Using their names would help us develop a bond.
8. One day when I went to see Carolyn she already had another visitor. That woman told me to come in and I did. Carolyn became confused. It was too stimulating for her. I didn't have the common sense to leave and go back later. I should have left immediately when I saw how confused she was.
9. I just assumed that Ruth didn't remember anything from our last visit, when I had given her a photograph of a rose. When I arrived the following Thursday I picked up that photograph and asked her where she got it. She looked a little annoyed and said that I had given it to her. Never more will I assume any person with Alzheimer's doesn't remember some specific event!
10. Finally, when Ruth asked me about her husband I made the mistake of telling her he had passed away, rather than using the generally agreed upon approach of telling a white lie and making up some reason he was temporarily gone.
Well - there you have it. Talk about being embarrassed. I certainly am. But at least I know the mistakes I've made and am avoiding them now. 
Does anyone out there know of other mistakes they may have made while visiting a person with Alzheimer's?

363,FIFTY,Childless by Choice - Gas Station Condoms and Rumors of Infertility,"Kevin B. Morrow, ContributorRealtor, Blogger, Baby Boomer - Convinced the movie ""Dazed and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/childless-by-choice-gas-s_b_6050172.html,"Children can't be let out in the yard to play until you get up at 1:30 p.m. on Sunday because you were out late the night before. Dogs can. Cats don't even need to be let out, you can ignore them.",2014-10-26,VOICES,"
Remaining childless through your childbearing years when you are in a continuous relationship is not just a decision or lack of making the decision to have children. It is also work.
It's very strange that I had no problem buying liquor or illegal drugs when I was in my late teens but I was too embarrassed to buy condoms in a drug store.
In the group of friends I hung out with while growing up, fear of pregnancy was very high. I think we would have had less of a problem calling our parents to bail us out of jail on a minor drug offense than to come home and tell them you had gotten someone pregnant or were pregnant (my female friends, not me).
My solution to this dilemma was to buy condoms from a vending machine in the bathroom of a gas station that was at the end of the airport runway.
I finally got over this fear of buying condoms publicly when I was about 18 and moved in with my now wife and she had no problem sending me to the store to buy her ""feminine hygiene"" products. Once I tackled that fear, condoms were no problem.
The fear of pregnancy followed my wife and I through our 20s and 30s. We were never ready to have kids, didn't have enough money to have kids, we should have done that last year, all the usual reasons. We then realized one day we were too old to have kids. Probably not biologically but definitely psychologically. We had become set in our ways, some may even say selfish and self-centered.
Children can't be let out in the yard to play until you get up at 1:30 p.m. on Sunday because you were out late the night before. Dogs can. Cats don't even need to be let out, you can ignore them.
Since we had entertained the thought of having children at various times during our marriage, when asked why we had never had children, we didn't express the thought that we had never wanted them. Our stock answer became ""we forgot to have kids."" 
The truth of course was somewhat more complicated than that since we had talked about it. The reality was that neither of us ever had a strong desire to be parents. The wonderful mental images had crossed our minds; coloring with a cute three year old, taking them trick or treating on Halloween, or seeing their faces on Christmas morning as they opened presents. We recognized however that this was a romanticized view and not everything that was involved in parenting.
Now that we are in our fifties there is no regret. My wife has even stopped the occasional worrying about the idea that I may change my mind, divorce her and find a younger woman to start ""the family I always wanted."" Of course maybe she has just realized that no one else would want me at this point.
My wife and I never talked about our lack of desire to have children with family very much which led to the following encounter between my wife and her father when we were in our late 30s.
My father-in-law had some sort of surgery and my wife had gone to Florida to be his ""nurse"" during this time. As he woke up from the anesthesia, she was standing there and he asked her ""Have you had Kevin tested?"" her response was ""for what?"" Thoughts of STDs and AIDS ran through her mind. He then said ""well you've never had kids."" Her response:
""I guess it might help if we stopped using birth control.""

Oh, and that other one about 60 being ""old"" and too late to make changes.",2015-04-29,VOICES,"Yesterday at the gym while stretching post-workout, I overheard two women talking about Bruce Jenner's recent announcement that he was transitioning into a woman. (I wasn't exactly eavesdropping; if you saw the small area devoted to stretching, you'd understand why it isn't easy to ignore nearby conversations.)
""Why do you think he waited so long to come out with that?"" asked one. (I had often wondered that myself, but was pretty sure I understood the possible answer.)
I was already getting annoyed.
She lifted one leg effortlessly into a yoga-like pose, adjusted her stance slightly, then continued. ""I mean, he's old! He's in his sixties, at least! Why even bother to live your life over at that point?""
Now I was really annoyed.
""Well,"" answered the other, adjusting her posture as she bent down to lay her palms flat onto the floor. ""It's obvious he's going through some sort of midlife crisis.""
I had to remind myself to breathe and hold myself back from hurling obscenities her way.
I've heard people call Bruce Jenner's announcement a publicity stunt. I've heard some say that he's doing it just for the money. I've seen them roll their eyes. And then again, I've turned a deaf ear to the ones who like to ramble on judgmentally and equally without sympathy about the insanity of it all.
Everyone seems to have an opinion. And they're entitled to it.
I don't usually get involved in politically-charged conversations, especially with perfect strangers. Come to think of it, I don't like heated discussions even with close friends and family. Call me meek, but I'm happy to call it a typical Libra trait: non-confrontational; valuing fairness and justice above most things; steering clear of conflict or argument.
But I really had to fight to keep my mouth shut when I heard that midlife crisis comment. Oh, and that other one about 60 being ""old"" and too late to make changes.
First, midlife is not a crisis. Rather, it's a time when we are able to reevaluate our choices in life and realize that there is time to change those choices, turn things around, learn from the past and step forward with renewed wisdom and vigor -- and confidence. I like to call it Midlife Opportunity. In fact, when I started my other blog, MidlifeMatters, in 2009, it was one of the very first things I wrote about.
So it's possible, after all, that Bruce Jenner waited all these years because -- simply put -- he realized that now was the right time to do it. Which brings me to my next point about 60 being ""too old."" Banish that thought! I wanted to scream out that day in the gym. I went back to school when I was in midlife and I also ran my first half-marathon at 60. I don't think I'm so special or an aberration, either: there are people in midlife all over the place who are stepping out and starting new and important chapters in their lives. With great accomplishment, I might add.
While Jenner admitted that his feelings dated back more than 50 years to when he was 8 or 9 and shamefully tried on his sister's clothes, carefully putting them back exactly where they hung in her closet so he wouldn't be found out, can you imagine coming to real terms with his confused feelings, or even coming close to understanding them, in that era? He, like that entire generation, was caught up in the shame of being different and swept up by the urgent need to conform and belong. And he played that game to its extreme by becoming a idealized physical symbol of a male: athletic, muscular, strong and bold.
To me, Jenner is taking the precious years he has left and giving himself -- and many other transgender people -- a precious gift: to live a life in which they are comfortable and secure in who they are. Finally.
Crisis? I think not. I think any ""crisis"" Jenner might have been experiencing is a thing of the past. 
That male/female battle is no longer so tightly locked.

Sometimes, I didn't know when to shut up and, even today, I notice the subtle change in my husband's expression and the way his eyes glaze over slightly when I talk...and talk and talk. I attribute this gift of gab to my Dad who lit up a room with his tall tales and spirited conversations.
My chatty nature and ease of blabbering away was a shoo-in for making acquaintances out of total strangers. My reason for striking up conversations wasn't to drag a new friend into the fold, kicking and screaming, but rather it was a staple of my gregarious nature. Sooner or later, for one reason or another, most of these people were relegated to the sidelines of friendship and demoted to associates. They became people I rarely saw, seldom gave more than a passing thought to and never sent a Christmas card. 
Just as one would never go into a marriage with the expectation of it leading down that bumpy road of divorce, the same applies to friendships. You go into friendship eager to forge what you hope will be a lifelong bond with that person upon whose shoulder you can lean, let down your guard and be as silly as any nonexistent law allows. You're hoping for the friend who just gets you.

Women have the unfortunate reputation of not being able to get along with one another. Some women can be catty, defensive, jealous, moody, insecure or distrustful. However, life is not a Real Housewives franchise and not all women behave in such abhorrent ways as depicted on reality TV. 
Still, we can be our own worst enemies. There is an unspoken competition taking place, even when many women aren't aware they're contenders. For some, this concealed antagonism starts from the word ""go"" as we play a match of one-up-womanship, comparing ourselves with another woman's looks, job, money, house, children, clothing, etc. Our friendships come with limitations, stipulations and initiations. 

It's not uncommon to desire friendships with other women. After all, it's part of the human dynamic, and as women-who tend to be intrinsically empathetic and nurturing-it may rub us the wrong way when we fail to form a connection with others. 
Unlike our childhood days, making friends as adults requires an investment of honesty, time and patience. BFFs don't just happen overnight, no matter what Hollywood fairytales would have you believe. Many already have their established circle of friends and, as such, some women find it difficult to insert themselves into this protected bubble. Life changes such as a new job, relocation or a change in relationship status can put us in a place of emptiness. We're new to the game and haven't quite caught on to the rules. We're the outsiders longing to make our way inside.
Does this mean we're desperate women? Certainly not. Men have their bromances; women need to feel a connection with other women and experience a sense of sisterhood. 
As I ease into my 52nd year of life, I realize that I miss the friendships that were cultivated in my youth. I'm fortunate to have a handful of friends-true friends-that have been in my heart since childhood. However, while friends have come and gone over the years, twice in my adult life I turned away from the natural progression of friendships, turned my back on what was expected of me and turned off my friend radar: I broke up with a friend.
Saying ""I no longer want to be your friend,"" was nothing if not difficult, but the alternatives were soul sucking. 
My friendship with Rachel* was a slowly dying one. She disrespected me and rarely reached out to me unless it benefitted her. Somewhere along the way, Rachel regarded me as her frenemy. The break-up was a venomous one. Insults were hurled at me with reckless abandon, and Rachel even went so far as to enlist the aid of her then-boyfriend, Brian*, who called me at work to pick up where she left off with the verbal assault. She was determined not to play by the unspoken rules. My respect for her went out the window.  Years later, I saw the couple at a festival and Rachel behaved as if nothing had happened. I've never forgotten her...not because she was such a wonderful friend but because, when I unfriended her in real life, she turned into someone I didn't want to know. Her hurtful words left a scar on my heart and I was no longer willing to suffer.
When I ended my friendship with Tanya* it wasn't any easier. Ironically, her painful tentacles reached out and stabbed me at a time when I thought I was being a good, caring friend. Secrets were kept, suspicions were raised and, in the end, my concerns for her were overshadowed by her deceit.

The loss of these friendships were nearly as painful as the breakup of my first marriage, however, these failed relationships have one thing in common: I came to a decision that needed to be made in order to rid myself of emotional toxicity.
While I cherish my handful of true friends, distance means we rarely see one another. Now, as I settle into a new home, a new city and a new state, I find myself once again pondering new friendships. Will new connections bring about a one-sided friendship? Will conflicts morph into a tumultuous emotional standoff? Will the commitment to friendship become hopelessly frayed around the edges? 
Friendships need to be nurtured in order to blossom and grow strong. In this new chapter of my life, I refuse to shy away from the prospect of adding new links in my chain of friends. I won't, however, stockpile friends the way a chipmunk gathers nuts and shoves them into his mouth. When it comes to true friends, quality outweighs quantity.

366,FIFTY,Goin' Down to Bitsyland,"Marshall P. Duke, ContributorCharles Howard Candler Professor of Psychology, Emory University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/goin-down-to-bitsyland_b_6448960.html,"There are ways to deal with the post-holiday doldrums, but they require our active participation.  First of all, we must realize that ""downs"" are natural aspects of life.  Everyone experiences them.  But there are ways to ease them.",2015-01-11,VOICES,"Despite T.S. Eliot's claim to the contrary, for many of us, January, not April, is the cruelest month. January is burdened with following the most emotional time of the year. Just past are Thanksgiving, Christmas, Chanukah, Kwanzaa and other major end-of-year sources (for the majority of us) of joy, togetherness, family-ness, and nostalgia as well as a host of other soul-warming kinds of experiences. (It must be said and recognized that, for some people, all these holiday-time emotions, though typically as intense, are not always positive, but the recommendations I make below apply to them as well, I believe.) But come January 2, a day after that ball dropped in Times Square, the strong positive feelings felt by so many are suddenly gone. The IRS starts sending out tax forms. Employers issue W-2s and 1099s. It's cold outside. It's cold inside. It's flu season. It's six weeks until the faintest formalized cultural excuse for human warmth and interaction -- Valentine's Day. Talk about a cruel month.  There are ways to deal with these post-holiday doldrums, however, but they require our active participation. First of all, we must realize that ""downs"" are natural aspects of life. Everyone experiences them. But there are ways to ease them. For decades, I have been involved in the study of ways in which people, families especially, deal with the ups and downs of life. Our research at the Center for the Study of Myth and Ritual at Emory University showed that among the most powerful forces that can be brought to bear in helping us through down times are family gatherings, family dinners, stories and rituals. It further turned out that it's not the dinners or the gatherings, per se, that make the difference. Its something more fundamental; something universal; something obvious. Simple human contact.
One of the most influential psychotherapists of our time, Irvin Yalom, once wrote that when it comes to the health-giving and healing effects of human relationships, it is hard to tell the ""container"" from the ""contents."" He would ask, for example, whether we get together (container) with friends to have dinner (contents), or if we invite friends to dinner (container) so we can be with people (contents). Is it that specific movie we want to see or is it the time we spend with the person sitting next to us? Likely, this is a nature/nurture kind of question where both are important, but all too often we lose sight of just how important it is to find reasons and ways simply to be with people, especially in these early months of the year.  I am sure that different people would describe a variety of ways they find the kind of human contact that I am prescribing, but I will use myself as a convenient sample. For me, as for many others in the 50+ age group, gathering together to play music and sing seems to be a fairly widespread phenomenon. Among our age cohort, there are literally millions of frustrated rockers, folk singers, classical musicians, choristers, composers, even critics. In this group resides the makings of uncountable garage bands, song circles, dancing clubs and other gatherings centered on music old and new. (In London, there is one singing club that is only for people who can't carry a tune!) Speaking as an aging guitar player (and I refer here to the player not the instrument!), I attend one of these groups almost every week and enjoy the hell out of it. Speaking as a psychologist, however, this music group represents exactly the kind of non-family ritual-based community that each one of us needs to stabilize our lives -- no matter how old we may be. To be sure, there is singing, but there is also talking, discussion of news, mutual support, nurturance, concern, encouragement, empathy, sympathy and all the other things that make communities ""therapeutic."" 
My group comprises a lawyer, teachers, a doctor, business people, Christians, Jews, northerners, southerners, moms, dads, grandparents, some who grieve and mourn recent losses, some who anticipate upcoming weddings, births and graduations. Sometimes we sing sad songs, other times hokey ones, other times songs of love and joy. We remembered Mary Travers of Peter, Paul and Mary when she passed away and this past year, we spent an entire session singing Pete Seeger melodies. I have personally and professionally experienced formal group psychotherapy -- 1960s-type T-Groups, Gestalt therapy groups, encounter groups, etc. -- but I can tell you that, for people looking for psychological wellness at any age, three hours of playing music and talking with the same group of people week after week is way more powerful a force than any of these.
Specially relevant to my purpose here of encouraging gathering together (in any form) as a pure and simple psychologically healthy thing, is that there are among my music group several people who regularly perform together at retirement homes and farmer's markets and the odd wedding. They specialize in bluegrass and country music and they call themselves the Bitsyland Band. 
I have always loved that name. It sounds so country, so down home. At first, that was the sense I had of it. But over time, I have come to a different meaning in that the word ""bitsy,"" itself, means very small. As such the group's name, purposely or not, can mean ""tiny land"" or, more academically, a microcosmic place. To me this means that, regardless of their size, be they music circles or church services or basketball games, all gatherings of people for some shared purpose are like Bitsyland -- places where we can go to be with people -- not to be alone. In some of these places people gather together to play music; in some, to make quilts; in some, to talk about books; in some, to watch and discuss movies. In an Ecclesiastes-like sense, there is a ""place"" for every purpose under Heaven. 
In truth, these places we gather are all what Yalom might term ""containers."" Regardless of the things that bring us together, however, the ""contents"" are always the same -- the warmth and reassurance that come from simply being with other people -- from simply knowing that there can be predictable, controllable and regular times when we will not be alone -- from simply knowing that there is always a Bitsyland somewhere for each of us. There, when the good things have been taken away. There, when the joyful times are less frequent. There, even in the Januarys of our years. Even in the winters of our lives.

367,FIFTY,Employment for the Ages,"Michael Hodin, ContributorCEO, Global Coalition on Aging",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/employment-for-the-ages_b_5699132.html,Britain is currently at the cusp of what the Financial Times has called the biggest reform to its pension system since it began a century ago.,2014-08-25,VOICES,"The latest U.S. figures on unemployment reveal a stunning gap between the official rate at about 6% and the more accurate if unofficial rate closer to double at about 12%. The two generally accepted explanations tend to be a profound and disturbing structural shift characterized boldly and accurately by the AEI Scholar, Nick Eberstadt that ""simply put, work in America has collapsed."" On the one side, there is the youth unemployment phenomenon, which seems to be about more than the Great Recession. But then there is also the equally disturbing fact that we persist in assuming a 20th century work/retirement model where the over 55 demographic is not really considered part of the workforce. Even if many of us do! 
As America's population ages, the parallel shift in allocation of resources, capital and talent are barely in sight. Moreover, from the retirement age to how we save (or not) for retirement seem still to be stuck in a 20th century demographic frame. A brief examination of three different locations -- UK, Germany and then right here in America's NYC -- reflect the stunning disconnect.   Britain's biggest pension reform in a century Britain is currently at the cusp of what the Financial Times has called the biggest reform to its pension system since it began a century ago. George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, has ended a rule that effectively forces pensioners to buy annuities in retirement. It may sound like a wonky sort of rule that only financiers understand, but the FT is right to claim the unprecedented significance. 
But Osborne's ruling probably won't go far enough. Like most of the developed world, Britain's feeling a nasty pinch as the 65+ population segment grows and the services they demand (medical, financial, social) increase in cost. Osborne's reform is right in that it's designed to spur market innovation for new financial products that fit 21st century health-spans and life-spans, but more needs to be done. Innovation in the financial sector is key to creating a sustainable economic model for an aging population. 
The British should push further in this direction. How can new instruments be created to encourage longer workforce participation? How can tax structures or investment vehicles incentive more saving and longer working lives? What products and services can be created to spur savings models that account for lives that stretch regularly into the 90s and 100s? As Sarah Harper, Director of the Oxford Institute on Ageing, has noted, one in three British girls born today will live to see 100. It'll take more than annuity reform to keep them financially sound for a century of life. 
Germany's turn for the worse In the wake of the Euro-austerity headache that lasted for years, the Germans earned the reputation as heartless spendthrifts. Whether Angela Merkel earned this reputation or whether it was irrational finger-pointing is beside the point. 
But recent developments in Germany regarding the lowering of the retirement age for certain demographic segments is puzzling - and fully incongruous with their prevailing reputation. Over the past few months, Germany - the fastest aging European nation - has lowered the retirement age from 65 to 63 for qualifying Germans. From an economic point of view, the move makes no sense. It's exactly the opposite of what Germany needs to do to maintain its economic strength as its population ages. 
German businesses have been wiser. The automaker BMW has built programs to keep older workers productive, and they've succeeded fabulously. Merkel should pay attention. Again, market innovation will be the key to 21st century success. 
The U.S. and Old New York The New York City Department of Aging has recently gotten an 8% increase in its budget under the new mayor. This is one of the largest percentage increases of any city agency, and the boost has been justified by the ballooning percentage of silver New Yorkers. By 2030, the ""elderly"" population will rise by 35%. Mayor de Blasio is right to recognize that investment is needed to get the right policies and programs in place for the aging Boomers, but New York's framework is still all wrong. 
The budget boost will be used to provide services of care, and it is framed almost entirely around models of aging that accept dependence and disability as the norm. To be sure, there are plenty of New Yorkers who need this kind of help, but the only way to prepare for the ballooning in aging is to create programs that incentivize work, entrepreneurship, independence, etc. 
New York will only be able to care for those who really need it if it stops caring for those who don't. A new 21st century understanding of aging must frame the mission of the Department of Aging, and it should ask itself: How can we build a ""silver economy"" that drives economic growth rather than simply manage care? 
Even more, for all of us across global economies, to stop thinking about aging as an aging issue, but as a core driver of 21st century economic growth and social value.

The world was a wonderland; a treasure and it belonged to me. 
Now nearly 100 years later, I experience not only the same feelings, curiosity and energy, but something more; desire and love for the gift of life. I experience living and realize the wisdom that only comes with living.
Age is a gift. If you think of age as a gift you will understand what to do with it. How to love it, to use it, to appreciate it. You will be creative in every physical and mental even spiritual way. I think of my body, as a musical instrument. It has to be tuned, polished, balanced and loved. Developing a beautiful tone is like developing a beautiful and powerful muscle. And silence, you have to learn how to listen to your instrument. Your wonderful instrument not only speaks to you, it demands that you listen. Your instrument has incredible memory, it knows silence and dislikes your impatience. If you listen to your instrument, it will find the knowledge it needs to move with grace, power, and energy. When that happens you will take a huge step into a life that everyone would give a million bucks for.
I don't do the things that I do because I think I should do them. I jump rope four minutes every day because it feels so good to jump rope. I practice yoga because it makes me feel better and I practice tango, because I'm in love with the dance form and the music. All this produces incredible joy and a creative and healthy life and body. So if you go to the gym because you feel you must go to the gym, instead of, I love all the exercises and those exercises give me and my body the breath of life, what more can one ask. It's basically all about loving what you do and why you do it. The reason you don't move? You get in the way. You were born to move. Give your beautiful instrument a break. Love it, teach it, and train it. Allow the energy it owns to have a life. Now it's possible for you to have a life. And above all, listen, listen, listen to your body. It wants to be heard.
It only takes one step to change your sedentary life and that step is do it because you want to, not because you have to. I'm told I inspire, if that's true what's the next step? Do you listen to your body and face the challenge and take action? There has to be the desire, the energy, the love for what you are doing. Or my inspiration is a zero. It's simply a word. Wouldn't I love to know that my inspiration has created energy and dedication? And a better life. A life of quality. 
It starts with the listener, then the doer and the love of what you are doing. Then comes the reward. You have created energy, strength and balance. If there is fatigue, it's good fatigue, that comes with satisfaction. You've answered the call of your first instrument. That you did something physical and now you are on a therapeutic road of less pain. I didn't say no pain, that comes with perseverance and time. The reward is worth it.
When your body is out of tune it's painful. You have to face the challenge. No one can do this for you. This is what I hear: ""I cant do that because?"" The word 'because' is a killer and does nothing to correct the problem; ""because I'm too old"", ""because I have arthritis"", ""because I have osteoporosis.""
Almost all can be improved with activity. Arthritis responds to activity. I know because my body is full of arthritis. Shoulders, knees, feet, hands. I will not allow arthritis to take over my life. The only solution is major activity and the best way to practice major activity is yoga. With a huge Y! Take the first step ""a yoga class."" Your body will be hooked. You may not be, but your body is talking. So listen. 
Your Stradivarius is so expensive there is no number on its value. Only you know its value. So keep it well tuned. The music it will produce will be beautiful, powerful, and rewarding. 
You have been given this incredible instrument. Your first and only instrument. Love it and give it the life it deserves. What a gift! WOW!!!

Why? She was fed up with dating.",2014-09-28,VOICES,"Now that I've let my New York Times subscription lapse, I get most of my news online. When I logged on this morning, this headline caught my eye: 
""Woman Gets Third Boob Implanted, Wants to Be 'Unattractive To Men.'"" 

Apparently, one Jasmine Tridevil, a massage therapist from Tampa, Florida, was claiming to have just spent $20,000 to get a third breast implanted between the two she already had. Why? She was fed up with dating, and did it so that guys would find her unattractive. 
The good news? She had to contact 50 docs before she found a surgeon willing to give her that extra boob. (Medical ethics! Alive and well! Who knew?) 
But she ultimately did find a doc to do the deed. 
Then she covered up, went home and quietly lived happily ever after? Not a chance! Instead, she publicized what she'd done, complete with a photo of herself in a low-cut top that all three boobs are spilling out of. 
Yeah, that's exactly how to become uninteresting to guys. Flood the internet with revealing photos that are all about your breasts! 
As a mild-mannered 60-year old librarian I could have given Tridevil some advice about getting men to ignore you. Stop leading with your cleavage! Dress modestly. Highlight your mind, not your body. (You will instantly become invisible to all but the best kind of guy.) 
My favorite part of stories like this? The reader comments:
 She thinks she has a hard time finding bras that fit now? Just wait! 
 Too bad she didn't shop for a brain implant. 
 Someone should have told her that less is more. 
 She did this to become unattractive to men? She obviously knows very little about men. 
 She'd rather be attractive to freaks? 
 If boobs were brains she'd be Einstein. But they're not. 
 Why not put one on your nose? That would be novel. 
 If God had wanted women to have three breasts, he would have made men with three hands. 
 Um, yeah. What? No. 
 She wants to be unattractive? Mission accomplished!
 Well you've had your 5 minutes of fame. Now what, hon? 
So glad you asked, commenter. Tridevil revealed in a radio interview that her ""biggest dream"" is to have an MTV reality show. 
Is her family on board? ""My mom won't talk to me,"" she says. ""She won't let my sister talk to me. My dad... is kind of ashamed of me..."" 
Terrific! A freaked out family who doesn't talk to you plays much better on reality TV than a sane, supportive and loving one. 
I, of course, was busy brainstorming a show this woman could star in. ""Who Wants To Be In Therapy?"" 
Start with the three-breasted lady. Add a couple of Kardashians, and those NFL players who keep getting away with beating their loved ones. Include a surgeon who'll do anything for a buck. Top it off with a few rabidly-anti- gay politicians caught cruising local bathrooms for gay sex. Then throw in a top notch psychotherapist. I might even watch that.
Did the whole thing turn out to be a big fat hoax? Of course it did! 
Snopes, the myth-busting website got on the case and soon revealed that ""Jasmine Tridevil"" appeared to be a domain name owned by one Alisha Jasmine Hessler, a Florida massage therapist whose website proclaimed her to be a ""Provider of Internet Hoaxes since 2014."" Not only that, but Hessler recently filed a stolen baggage claim at Tampa International Airport that listed a ""3 breast prosthesis"" among the items lost."" (Nor, when questioned, could she produce a doctor to back up her story.) 
Busted!
Tridevil, it seems, isn't a 3-breasted lady after all -- only a two-breasted liar who wants her own TV show. 
The sad thing is that she'll probably get it.
As for me? I'm re-subscribing to the Times.

It's what we try to teach our children, right? But it shouldn't end with teaching our kids, it should be part of the behavior we grownups model every day.
As I approach the first anniversary of my father's passing, I find myself becoming increasingly sad, replaying the last two weeks of his life over and over. For Dad, 13 days was all it took -- a switch was flipped and my vibrant, healthy father was no longer with us. If he could have chosen his own end, I'm fairly certain he would have picked the one God gave him. His mind remained forever sharp (he was even whispering stock tips from the hospital bed), he was in no significant pain, and it was fast. He was not afraid to die -- never was. Mostly, he was concerned for us, Mom, his kids, and grandkids. He needed to know we would be okay. And despite the gaping hole his absence leaves, we are okay. Some days more okay than others, but somehow sorting through one of life's promises: death.
Recently, I was having a less-okay day. I was hosting a graduation party and discovered I bought plastic spoons instead of forks. I needed to do a quick return at the party goods store. Turns out you can't just switch out forks for spoons. Instead, you must wait on line, and do an ""official"" exchange. As I said, I was already having a less-okay day, missing my father, missing his presence at his granddaughter's party and in disbelief that nearly an entire year had passed. I was crying quietly in line. Evidently I was more than silent crying. I was annoyed and impatient too. There were three customers ahead of me; two buying balloons -- time-consuming balloons that needed to be chosen and sorted, and did I mention time-consuming? All I wanted was forks for spoons.  The gentleman in front of me was beginning his order and asked where he could find the graduation balloon selection. I saw what appeared to be a wall of graduation balloons and suggested he look at it for his choices. I didn't think I was being rude, nor do I think my voice was impatient, but I certainly was trying to facilitate his order. Turns out that was not the place to select from and he was not happy with me. 
He became angry. ""Take her first,"" he said. ""She doesn't want to be here.""
I didn't.  ""Thank you,"" I said. He didn't stop.
""Now she thinks she runs the store. She can tell everyone what to do.""
I was confused.
""You are selfish and narcissistic. Get her out of this store,"" he said, his voice loud and mad, his face red with anger.
I remained calm. ""You don't know what is going on in other people's lives,"" I said.
""I don't give a sh*t what's going on in your life."" His response stopped me in my tracks. His tirade continued, but became blurry to me, as I hung on his previous words. 
I finished my transaction. Got my forks, left my spoons and left the store. I cried the whole way home. I cried at home, so hard and inconsolably, my husband was worried for my safety or health, never figuring I was berated by a stranger in a party goods store. Maybe I should thank this angry stranger because his mean words enabled me cry so hard and so long, something I rarely allow myself to do. And I was in need of a good cry that day.
Maybe the angry stranger was right. Maybe I am narcissistic. Maybe I am selfish. Or maybe I just needed human kindness. Someone to say, go ahead of me, just because. Someone to say I DO give a sh*t what's going on in your life. 
But here's the thing I just figured out -- maybe at that exact moment he needed that same sort of kindness from me, and I wasn't up to the challenge. Maybe we both succumbed to our frailties at the exact same moment. After all, we are all human.
I wonder if I missed his signs. He certainly missed mine. So let's try to remember, as best we can, to choose kindness. Always. Because a little act of kindness can go a long way.
Right, Dad?

371,FIFTY,Why An Aging Population Is NOT A Burden On The Economy,"Michael Hodin, ContributorCEO, Global Coalition on Aging",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/population-growth_b_6367202.html,"As one of their year-end announcements, The Centers For Disease Control reported the U.S. birth rate at 1.86, below the replacement level of 2.1. There have already been grumblings about how a lowered fertility rate nationally will have an adverse impact on American economic growth.",2014-12-26,VOICES,"As one of their year-end announcements, The Centers for Disease Control reported the U.S. birth rate at 1.86, below the replacement level of 2.1. There have already been grumblings about how a lowered fertility rate nationally will have an adverse impact on American economic growth. 
While fertility can indicate social and economic health, it's simply wrong to conclude that economic growth drops in parallel with fertility. Set this CDC data against the Transamerica Research Center (TRC) data that has just come out - which illustrates how the baby boomer generation is revolutionizing retirement. Taken together, one gets a different, more nuanced view of economic growth in our 21st century. It's not just about babies - but adults.
Sustained drops in fertility will indeed create a world with more ""old"" than ""young,"" but this is a potential level for growth if the oldies are still active, engaged, and productive. Here are seven things the pundits keep missing about ""population aging"" and economic growth:
More are working into retirement: The TRC research reveals that a stunning 65 percent of Baby Boomer workers either plan to work past age 65 or do not plan to retire. Of these, over one-in-three will continue to work because they enjoy it. Do the math, and this numbers quickly counterbalance the fall in fertility. But to truly capture this shift, employers must change their workplace norms. Sadly, the workplace isn't keeping pace. The TRC survey found that only 48 percent of employers have practices in place to enable a shifting from full-time to part-time work, and even fewer have employees who believe such options to be available to them. 
The U.S. remains relatively fertile. Relative to economic peers -- and even compared to many emerging markets -- American women are fertile. In Japan, Korea, Singapore and much of Europe, birth rates are now well below 1.5, and in some cases even lower. These low birthrates -- combined with the ""longevity miracle"" bequeathed by massive strides in medicine, healthcare, and technology -- will soon create populations where one-third of the population is over-60, with Japan creeping to 40 percent. Amazingly, by 2020, we can expect Japan to sell more adult diapers than baby diapers. 
Immigration is balancing the U.S. Missing from the increasingly fierce arguments over immigration in the U.S. is the role that immigrants play in balancing out the population structure. While the older populations remain vital and brimming with potential, the younger immigrant populations are holding the U.S. back from the warp-speed aging that we're seeing in Japan and Europe. 
There is no connection between the ""financial crisis"" and lower fertility. The drop in birth rates is long-term, structural consequence of modernization, not a temporary fluke of a short-term economic malaise. The trend can be seen globally -- in Brazil, China, India, and elsewhere. In India, it's of particular significance, given that the country is still considered the global poster child for persistent Malthusians who, ideologically, insist that there are too many of us relative to the resources available. In India today, fertility is right at ""replacement level,"" dropping from 5+ births per woman only a short time ago. 
Population aging is not a burden on economic growth. It is only a burden if we persist in forcing 21st century demographics into 20th century norms. Keeping people working, active, and engaged into their 70s, 80s, and beyond is the formula for economic growth in our time. It's as true for America as it is for the rest of the world considering what a ""Silver Economy"" looks like. 
Aging matters to all generations. The twin demographic forces -- longer lives, lower birthrates -- are going to be with us for the foreseeable future. Thus, in charting out new avenues for aging, we are equally thinking about Millennials and their children as we are aging boomers. We make a grave mistake if we only engage older adults in conversations about rethinking and reimagining how we spend on health, what we do about retirement, where we make our investments, and what it means to create an age-friendly city. 
Boomers have the buying power. While we fret over the reduced buying and consumption power of younger Americans, we are missing the explosion of the ""silver economy."" By 2017 in the U.S., the over-60s will account for 70 percent of all disposable income. If we begin to reimagine the spending capacity of this -- which is bigger and more vital than ever before -- we see an entirely different set of prospects for the American economy in the next decades ahead. 
The new CDC data on the drop in fertility has given the pundits more fuel for their short-sighted fire. But enough of the knee-jerk, doomsday proselytizing. There is immense potential in the aging of the population, and it's time to reorient our thinking so we can seize it.

The grocery stores are buzzing with turkey orders, neighborhood pumpkin patches are being converted over to Christmas tree lots (I prefer the evergreen smell over the hay), everyone is talking about where they’re celebrating and who they are going to be with for Thanksgiving this year.
It’s not enough to just have Thanksgiving. According to the stories on the radio, TV, newspapers, magazines and online, you must have THE BEST THANKSGIVING EVER! You can spend hours just focusing on your turkey. (I always stuff my turkey with apples and oranges because it helps keep the cavity moist. Do not use this idea on your vagina... it will not work!)
So what else is the menopausal woman focused on this Thanksgiving?
- She is focused on how she is going to remember to even buy the turkey.
- She is focused on her stomach and her hips -- wondering how she is going to fit into last year’s holiday clothes.
- She is focused on how to keep her uncontrollable emotions in control when normal family holiday stress kicks in.
- She is focused on sleep -- she needs it!
- She is focused on trying not to be a bitchface with her loved ones.
In the spirit of giving and being thankful, I am going to give you my special perimenopause and menopause Thanksgiving recipe, which helps me look forward to and enjoy the holidays!
Ingredients:
(Do not preheat the oven -- you are already too hot.)
In a large bowl combine:
- 2 heaping tablespoons of friends and family
- One 2 pound bag of very thankful
- 1 cup of it’s ok to not be perfect
- 3 sticks of “Can you help me plan, cook, and clean up?”
- 4 large cups of peeled, cored, and chopped patience
- Sprinkle in a dusting of alcohol (trust me if you over do this, things can get out of hand)
- Do not make any sauce of any kind as you are saucy enough as it is
- Gently stir the above ingredients together. Never beat anything -- we beat ourselves up enough already
- Remember: Suffering in silence is OUT -- Reaching out is IN!
- The final step is to fold in lots of love!
Now you have the recipe for THE BEST THANKSGIVING EVER!

373,FIFTY,A True-Life Love Story: What My Grandparents Taught Me About Devotion,"Patricia Crisafulli, ContributorAuthor, founder, FaithHopeandFiction.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lessons-from-grandparents_b_5701059.html,"It started with a chance meeting: Richard Donohue Long, a tall, good-looking American soldier from Syracuse, New York, walked down a village street in France, just as Leone Sicre threw open a pair of wooden shutters to shake out a duvet cover. He ducked; she slammed the shutters closed.",2014-08-22,VOICES,"By the time I came along, they were old: white-haired, bodies softened by age and weakened by disease; tested by hardship, war and the Great Depression. As the youngest of their eight grandchildren, I knew them as Grandma Long, who still spoke with the strong accent of her native France, and Grandpa Long, who moved with extreme difficulty because rheumatoid arthritis had attacked his spine.
I could not see until many years later and after the death of my grandfather that theirs was truly a love story; two people brought together during the Great War, whose devotion to each other never wavered during months of separation and uncertainty, and then 50 years together.
It started with a chance meeting: Richard Donohue Long, a tall, good-looking American soldier from Syracuse, New York, walked down a village street in France, just as Leone Sicre threw open a pair of wooden shutters to shake out a duvet cover. He ducked; she slammed the shutters closed. 
After the war, Dick wanted to marry Leone, but she refused to be a war bride like so many girls in her village who seemed to be going off with soldiers they barely knew. So Leone sent Dick home to think about it, not fully comprehending the distance between France and New York State. For six months he wrote and despaired when he never got a reply (his letters were intercepted by one of Leone's sisters for reasons that were never quite clear). In the one letter that finally reached her, Dick said he would stop writing and accept her silence as final rejection. She quickly wrote back and agreed to marry him, but only if they could live in France.
Dick and Leone married in 1920, and lived in Paris for two years, before moving to the U.S. with their baby daughter because Dick's mother claimed to be dying -- until she threw open the front door to welcome him home, with a frosty reception for his foreign bride. When they needed a home of their own, Dick bought the first farm he could find in a remote, rural area of northern New York State.  For Leone, it was a long way from France, and her many brothers and sisters, the parents she never saw again, and life in a bustling village. Instead, she learned to milk a cow, churn butter and tend crops. By the time the Depression hit, Dick and Leone had three little girls; my mother was the middle child. 
In the leanest Depression years, the farm put food on the table, but there was no money; soon, the bank threatened foreclosure. Come December all appeared lost, but Leone had a plan: She cut willow branches, shaped them into circles, and wrapped them with ground pine. Sitting up all night, she made wreaths until her hands cracked and bled. Early in the morning, she packed the wreaths into a hamper basket fitted with leather shoulder straps. With that basket on his back, Dick caught the milk train to Syracuse, where he walked door to door, selling wreaths right up until Christmas. Week after week, they finally made enough to pay the interest on the mortgage, with exactly one dime left over, which Dick spent to buy Leone a powder puff. 
After the Depression, Dick got a job as a state highway foreman, and the couple moved to Oswego, New York, living a few miles from the city limits. Their last home was an old farmhouse heated by a coal stove in the kitchen. I can still picture Grandpa sitting at the table with his sketchpad as he drew landscapes, deer and birds from memory, a postcard, or a photo in a magazine, and Grandma bringing him a cup of coffee and telling him his latest picture was her favorite. He called her ""Cherie,"" and their private conversations were always in French. Even we grandchildren could see they were each other's first priority. 
When my grandfather died in 1970, sadly on my grandmother's birthday, they were no longer the tall, handsome American soldier, and the coquettish French girl with the chestnut hair. Time and toil had worn them down, but their love was unchanged and, no doubt, eternal.

Not a third baby -- and no, I don't want your baby (nice try, though).
I want my baby back. The boy or the girl, it doesn't really matter at this point. Maybe both of them.
Just not at the same time.
For the past few months, I have been going through this horrible, embarrassing midlife ""thing"" where I love babies. LOVE them. And because the stars are aligned or life is really cruel my Facebook and Instagram feeds seem to be overflowing with wee little ones who are sleeping, learning to walk, just born or maybe celebrating a first birthday. Chubby little thighs, the tiniest of fingers and a smattering of fine, wispy hair. The bright blue-eyed babes are especially yummy, as both of mine sport different shades of blue, even into their teen years.
These babies in my stream? Clean slates, all of them. Asking nothing more from you than to hold them, feed them and love them unconditionally. What is simpler and more life-affirming than a brand new baby? It's a fresh start, a reminder that life goes on. A reason to love yourself a wee bit more than you did. Babies don't hold grudges, roll their eyes when you ask a favor or leave their socks on the floor. They take a lot of care, but what they give back you can't get anywhere else. Joy, happiness, that look of I-love-you-so-very-much that you can only get from a little one without a curfew, a driver's license or a list of chores to complete.
I find myself willing my soul back in time, grabbing frantically for what was once my daily life with babies and trying to remember. To remember how it felt to snuggle a sleepy one right up next to my neck in the early-morning hours when the rest of the house slept. To remember what it felt like to bathe that tiny first baby, so afraid he would slip from my hands and be hurt, or scared.
To remember hearing, ""It's a boy!"" and ""It's a girl!"" and both times feeling that somehow I already knew who they were, that I could feel their presence in my daily life since those little lines appeared on the pregnancy tests. To remember when they started to dance, to sing and to play pretend -- and all of it without any feelings of self-consciousness or anxiety. To remember what it felt like to rock in the kitchen with a baby girl on my hip and feel her heartbeat through my hand on her tiny back. To soothe tears, protect, console, teach, or just to be in the moment.
But I can't remember.
""You're making memories!"" people loved to say to me during those late afternoon grocery store runs or endless hours spent pushing a swing robotically at the park. I probably say that now, to my much-younger friends who are just starting their little families. And somewhere, deep inside they get it. They know too, that while their time feels long and routine and boring it will all end faster than they can imagine.
But memories! ""You will have all the memories!"" they shout. But the memories you make aren't all solidly defined or outlined as time goes by. Some memories have jagged edges, some are raw and painful and many of your memories won't match up with how your kids remember them (which is a shock). But then there are moments that stand alone as if a searchlight shines on them, so vivid and defined that you can relive them at any time.
Just rewind.
But other memories? The day-to-day routine, the bath times and the bedtimes, endless renditions of Hop on Pop or Brown Bear, Brown Bear and the countless boxes of mac and cheese I made, scraping the bottom for a few scraps of my own. The ""firsts"" and the ""lasts"" for each baby, from taking tentative first steps to losing a first tooth to starting high school.
To graduation, and beyond.
They blur together -- like a fog that I can't see through just yet. I comb through boxes of printed photos (yes, my little ones were pre-digital) that span an entire childhood and I can ""see"" it all. It happened, it was real and we all lived to tell about it. There were camping trips and amusement parks, birthdays and sleepovers, friends, family, beloved pets and favorite toys. I didn't have a blog or a journal when mine were small. We made videos and took pictures, so we do have lots of great memories stored in boxes down the hall.
But the blur of memory that I have of those 20 years is unsettling to me right now. I honestly thought I would remember more vividly. I worry at times that I am truly starting to lose my memory, one old and faded mental photograph at a time.
But just give me that baby. My baby, either one of them.
If only I could relive a day with my baby girl on my hip, or my baby boy laughing so hard he would lose his breath.
I promise I would remember -- I really would.
I would just love to hit rewind again.

376,FIFTY,The 4 Difficulties Of Being Alone In A Partnered World,"Dr. Margaret Rutherford, ContributorClinical Psychologist, Mental Health/Midlife Blogger",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/holiday-loneliness_b_6280452.html,I noticed a woman eating by herself. She mostly looked at her iPhone. I concentrated on my eggs and short stack. A lot of people tell me they could never eat alone.,2014-12-12,VOICES,"We had breakfast at a local diner Saturday morning. Deer with huge antlers mounted on the walls. A life-size John Wayne cutout greets you at the door. Chicken fried steak and chocolate gravy the specialities.
You definitely know you are in the South. 
I noticed a woman eating by herself. She mostly looked at her iPhone. I concentrated on my eggs and short stack.
A lot of people tell me they could never eat alone.
I remember one of my first efforts. I had just gotten divorced. Wanted to go to my (had been our...) favorite Italian place in Dallas. I knew it would be dark. Convinced myself I would be okay.
I ordered Fettuccine Alfredo, my absolute favorite. It came piping hot. Smelling divine. I reached for the Parmesan cheese and liberally shook it all over the pasta. Dove in for that first rich, mouth-watering bite.
It wasn't Parmesan. It was sugar.
Tears filled my eyes. Just how stupid was I. I was mortified. ""Had anybody seen?"".
I couldn't bring myself to tell the waitress so I quietly tried to scrape the stuff off the perfectly-cooked noodles. Unfortunately I had already mixed it together.
I ate sickly sweet pasta that night. Just because I was by myself.
Had I been in the company of others, I would have laughed it off. Ordered another bowl.
My being alone paralyzed me. Yes... It also had to do with the incredible sense of failure I was already experiencing. But I think I could have handled it with laughter if someone -- anyone -- had been sitting next to me.
What is it about being alone that is so difficult?
1. Fear of non-acceptance.
Widows tell me of their fear of how they will be accepted if arriving somewhere alone. They feel that they might not be welcome. Not only are they dealing with their grief, but somehow tell themselves that appearing solo is not okay. Feels uncomfortable to be the single woman with married couples. It changes the dynamic.
Or even asking to go with someone. ""Judy and John don't want me tagging along"". (I usually challenge this though. Judy and John would likely love the company...)
2. Issues of security.
There is a simple security in having someone. I remember a widow I saw as a patient. Her husband had been dead for quite some time. But it was early winter. She slipped and fell on the front steps. Broke her arm. Without thinking, she automatically called out for him.
She told me it was at that moment an immense loneliness gripped her. Much more painful than her broken arm.
3. Being alone in a partnered world.
I hear about fatigue. You just get tired of it. Being alone in a partnered world. No one to talk with about the game or the party. After everyone has said goodnight.
4. Dealing with self-worth.
What does it mean to not have a partner? Especially if you want a relationship? It's difficult to come to terms with not necessarily being in control of that. Not letting it affect how you feel about yourself.
My paralysis at the dinner table was due to this. I thought it ""said something about me"" that I was alone. I was ""less"" than someone with a dinner companion.
The holidays can make it harder.
There are some folks that it doesn't seem to affect. They appear to do it easily. Maybe those people are more comfortable in their own skins. Maybe they have a ""loner"" streak. They would not say they are lonely. They have achieved a good balance of being with others and living their own life.
I have long thought that loneliness should be a diagnosis. Like depression. When you experience it, it has an ache that is like no other. Some people avoid it like the plague. Have people around them constantly. Others bear it who want a relationship, but life just hasn't led to that. Maybe have tried -- maybe given up. Maybe just taking a rest.
You can be very lonely within a relationship as well. But it's different than not having a partner at all.
It is important to be able to value your own company. To be able to watch a sunset, read a book or cook a meal. And enjoy it for what it is just for you.
Please remember those who are living life on their own. Divorced. Widowed. Perhaps have never chosen to be partnered. Or are choosing to live life alone now.
Reassure them they are wanted. Even treasured.
And if it's you. Know that you are.
Especially now. During the holiday season.
You may appreciate that gift yourself one day.

But there's a reason that classic films are still oh-so-cool today. That star quality that made old-school actors and actresses shine even before the days of color picture is something of a lost art. Though we may love Clooney, Roberts, and the like, we can't help but yearn for tinseltown classics and that certain something that was just inimitable and that sex appeal that could never be equalled.

You can insert any level of leadership in that line, and you'll be accurate.
""I want a woman to be CEO. I just don't want THAT woman.""
If you dig deeper, you'll find a variety of valid reasons why THAT woman should never be in a position of power.
Based upon comments in previous elections, it's possible that her calves are too big. And how in the world can a woman handle high-level leadership responsibilities with cankles? Who could possibly pay attention to her during a TedTalk® with those swollen appendages offending the eye?
While watching a political convention one year, I heard a woman say that any female running for office should take off those hideous, comfortable pumps and wear Stilettos so as to slenderize her legs.
I would love to see footage of Lyndon Johnson hobbling to the podium for a major announcement wearing his favorite pair of Jimmy Choo's. 
We can take a woman facing tremendous pressure, working 80 hours a week, attempting to do her job against unbelievable odds, and make it all about her new haircut.
Just ask Marcia Clark.
According to recent comments on social media, we apparently want a woman President who will talk about her grandchildren on a regular basis.
I remember the last time one of our male Presidents stopped a press conference on security by saying, ""Before we discuss nuclear arms, have you seen this latest photo of Jimmybob, my grandson? Isn't he adorable?""
""I want a woman to be President. I just don't want THAT woman. She's too bossy.""
Dealing with foreign countries and terrorists and potential economic collapse might make you a little fussy, I'm not sure. And helping to lead an internationally critical mission could require some tough decisions, but I guess a female leader could at least approach the situation with some decorum.
""Mr. Terrorist -- would you please let the CIA guys in? Please? I hate to intrude, but I think in this situation I might have to. Truly, your home is lovely. If you can accommodate, I'd be more than happy to talk to the women in the house about a Yankee Candle party at some point.""
Who cares if a women has a law degree or has competed and thrived in an Ivy League environment? We'd rather she has a degree from Emily Post. Anybody can pass exams in one of the most esteemed law schools in the country, but selecting the correct floral arrangements for an upcoming wedding? Priceless.  ""I want a woman to be President. I just don't want THAT woman. Her husband slept around. She obviously works too much and couldn't keep him happy.""
We still believe, somehow, that men only sleep around because they are not well-served by their wives in a variety of ways. So, Mrs. Jefferson, shame on you. Thomas would have never done what he did if you had been a little more seductive in that petticoat. And shame on you, Mrs. Washington, and Mrs. Cleveland, and Mrs. Harding, and Mrs. Roosevelt, and Mrs. Eisenhower, and Mrs. Kennedy, and Mrs. Johnson, continuing ad infinitum. 
Maribel Morgan could have taught you so many things, because the total woman, the complete package, keeps her husband happy. For those of you who lived in a time devoid of Saran Wrap . . . you're exempted from this last statement.
In summary, it seems that we might elect a woman President if she --
Bakes cookies  Talks about grandkids  Has no wrinkles and a killer figure  Dresses in designer outfits  Can rock stilettos  Knows when to serve people around her  Stays quiet and humble  Keeps her husband happy
I don't know about you, but that list doesn't seem to describe the leader of the free world. It describes June Cleaver in her pearls fixing dinner for her family in a time that existed only on television.
Why don't we step outside of the box created by the 1950's ABC lineup and give ourselves a break? Let's raise ourselves up from the ""you're only as good as your outfit"" belief and stand eye-to-eye with our own amazing intellects.
Let's stop judging each other by what we wear, or what we weigh. Let's stop valuing passive attributes.
Let's remember our elementary school days, before we were convinced that sexual attractiveness was our greatest value. 
We are warriors. And warriors don't get deflected by sticks and stones. Warriors work together to change the world, even with large calves and cankles.

Reflexes slow and the foot moves slower from the gas to the brake.,2014-10-15,VOICES,"""R-E-S-P-E-C-T"" Aretha Franklin spells it out. Call it respect or call it dignity. If only my mother had been approached that way. Here's what happened: some family members decided it was time for my mother to stop driving. True, she is in her late eighties, hasn't been in the best of health, and is increasingly forgetful. Nevertheless, she is still a mentally and emotionally competent adult with a current driver's license and unblemished driving record. She deserved to be included in this life-altering decision.
It's not easy for anyone when the time to put away the car keys is reached: the time when he or she has to relinquish that great worldwide symbol of independence -- driving a car. It happens for some at earlier ages than for others. Sight starts to fail and driving at night becomes increasing difficult. Reflexes slow and the foot moves slower from the gas to the brake. Medications cause drowsiness. Arthritis makes it hard to turn the neck. 
Even if your aging friend or relative has never had an accident, never dinged the car, never even gotten a ticket, the time will still come when driving is no longer safe. But the loss is so much greater than just needing to find another form of transportation to the grocery store or the doctor appointment. Losing the keys to the car means the elder needs to be taken care of; the parent or grandparent becomes the child in a very real sense. But to be treated like a child, as in my mother's case, is something else entirely! 
My well-meaning family members went behind my mother's back and made her car ""disappear,"" sending it to the shop for fabricated ""repairs."" My mother was so upset to discover her car was MIA that she tried to get an old farm truck going and wound up backing into a tree. So the ruse of the missing car did far more damage than a simple face-to-face conversation would have done.
Why didn't the family sit down with her and say, ""We think the time has come for you to stop driving. We are concerned for your safety. We love you. We don't want you to get hurt. We don't want anyone else to get hurt."" Why is it so difficult to have a considerate and compassionate talk, stating the facts in a way that acknowledges the parent is still an adult, not a child to be tricked? 
More people dread the ""taking away the keys"" conversation than discussing funeral arrangements! Have we become so deficient in our communication skills that we would rather have an email sent stating ""your license has been revoked"" than holding a hand, looking into a wrinkled face and saying we care so much about you that we are worried?
We must not treat people who are still mentally competent like children. It is disempowering, to say the least, and certainly disrespectful to those who spent decades of their lives taking care of us. Whatever happened to the concept of elders as wise ones, as mentors, as people of intrinsic value? Even if Grandma has crumpled the fender of her car on her mail box and just doesn't know how it jumped in front of her car, she is still someone to be treated with consideration and understanding, with sensitivity and respect. Perhaps it is time to talk to her about giving up driving, but how it's done is critical.
So, first, talk to your elder in a way that lets them know they are a competent adult, still worthy of your love and respect. It can't hurt, and it might just solve the problem. I dearly wish that it would have happened that way with my mother.

This expat is right. There's some planning...and a whole lot of commitment...and yes, some panic...involved in expatriation, that's certain. But certainly, not as much as parenthood involves.
When it's all said and done, the feeling of accomplishment you have as a successful expat is a badge to wear with honor. (And just like your childbirth stories, the tales you will have to tell!)
Much like the first stages of pregnancy, as you begin your expat journey -- especially if it's the first time you are moving to a foreign country--you won't know quite what to expect. You're sure to be a little nervous, but excited and happy, too.
And just as awaiting the birth of your first child, there will be many similar questions you will have: What will it be like? What will it look like? Will you love it? Will it love you? Will it be painful? How many years will you have together? Is there any way to make the unknowns a bit more certain? How much work and preparation will need to (or can) be done beforehand? And how much work and commitment will be required long term? 
(Oh, dear first-time parents, if you only knew the answer to that last one...)
Parenthood is the great unknown. And no matter how much you prepare, your expat life will be the same. There will be ups and downs and ins and outs, but at the end, you'll be better for it. You will have something uniquely your own, but in the case of living overseas, instead of making a mark on someone else's life, the mark you make will be on your own.
Is there a way to prepare for expat life... a way to be as sure as you can be that you'll love it and that, in return, it will love you back?
We've said it before: when contemplating a life abroad, do your research. Start here. Or better yet (and shameless plug), spend $20 and buy our book. (Think of us as your midwives.)
Most importantly, include yourself in that research. You are, after all, the most critical element in all of this. Your success or failure is in your hands. So think deeply about you and what makes you happy. 
We call this ""profiling yourself."" We mention it over and over again in our book and we've written about it many times in this blog and for others. 
Once you've identified where it is you want to go on your expat journey, you need to figure out how to make it happen; how to get there and how to stay there, what you'll take with you and what you'll leave behind. Not to mention all those nuts and bolts issues you'll need to address...like health care and mail and finances and taxes and... well, you get the picture. Those are the labor pains. And thankfully, you'll quickly get through them.
Importantly, you'll need a plan for what you'll do once you get where you're going. This is a crucial step that too many would-be expats overlook. There is only so much snorkeling, sunbathing and hammocking you can do... 
To go back to the parenting analogy, you usually have big plans for your children... plans you begin to formulate long before they are born. So do the same for your expat life. Think about the kind of community you want...not necessarily the scenery or the physical structures, but the people who live there. 
Make sure the community you are considering is a place that will contribute to your quality of life. Likeminded people, a safe environment, plenty of activities you enjoy and a pleasant climate in which to do them: these should top your list.
Come to think of it: aren't these the things we want for our children? A stimulating environment and a safe place to play.
It occurs to us that the analogies and similarities between impending parenthood and a move overseas are strong, indeed.
So here's some final food for thought: Those who fear parenthood don't understand that it's not something perfect people do, but something that perfects you. The end product isn't the child but the parent.
Likewise, those who fear living in a different culture will never experience the personal transformation that will result from that experience. 
And here's one more: As a parent, it's said that if you can give your child only one gift, let it be enthusiasm. 
The same is true about expatriation. Approach it with eyes wide open. With wonder and enthusiasm and affection. You will be rewarded.

Back in the day, I had a pretty decent body, great hair, good skin and I never appreciated it as I should have. I did some modeling, worked with models and owned a modeling agency. Still, I wasn't happy with my body.

After having two kids, I was never able to lose the paunch. That's not true... I could have if I'd really worked at it, but I didn't. I even bought a health club, thinking I could teach aerobics and it would miraculously disappear. Crazy, huh?
At 42 years old, I decided to have a tummy tuck, because I was unhappy and I knew if I could FINALLY have a flat stomach, my life would be fabulous! Oh, how I would love to bitch slap my former self for that mistake.
It was a botched procedure, which left me with a good-sized rock of scar tissue in the middle of my lower abdomen. The universe can be cold when you need to wake-up and face reality.
Life went on, and twenty lus years later I still hate my stomach, but I'm trying to let it go. I am 10 pounds overweight, (give or take a few), which is not bad for someone who loathes exercise.
I don't worry much about my stomach these days, because I'm trying to figure out how to get my eyebrows back. Stomachs can be hidden, camouflaged, buried under clothing. Eyebrows? Not so much.
I've had the thyroid test and all is normal. And yet, I have lost, approximately, 90% of my body hair, starting at the eyebrows. I don't miss shaving my legs, but, of course, there are still hairy arm pits to deal with. Damn you, Mother Nature!
In the meantime, I've found products that help camouflage the flaws. And, I have to admit, all the years of trying to take good care of my skin has paid off. I have never removed makeup at bedtime, and I'm not advocating you do the same, but it's worked for me. Good genes trump makeup remover, apparently.
So, I think if I could just get an eyebrow transplant, all would be right in my world. Then I remember the stomach fiasco and smack myself.
Have you made mistakes in the name of beauty that you've regretted? Please share!

We'll be following 15 remarkable ladies throughout the year as they make a radical change in their lives, whether it's embarking on a 500-mile hike, starting a new career or attempting to find love on the Internet. Start from the beginning here.
 Meris Emory, 65, has retired, is about to take her trip-of-a-lifetime, and will soon start a workout program for fellow sufferers of Parkinson's Disease.
""I retired on April 2 and I feel just great about it -- elated, actually! I loved doing my job up until about two days before I left -- I loved it for 40 years -- but man, at the end, I was just ready to move on. Sure I miss my co-workers, but life feels so much easier to me now, no more 12-hour days and I can work on my own projects. I'm loving it.
I had a great 65th birthday party at the end of March. My friends all flew in, even the ones from Hawaii, and we all cooked together and had the best time. We played music outside -- stuff from the '60s. '70s and '80s -- and we hung out and talked and just had a great time all being together. I love just being around the people I love.
On May 4th, Liz and I leave for a month-long camping trip and right now we're busy getting ready and packed for that. We're going to meet friends in Arches National Park and travel together through the Southwest. We'll stay in Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. They have a popup trailer and so do we, so we'll visit all the national parks, cook, hangout, hike together. Just our friends and our dogs. We'll spend four nights camping on rim of the Grand Canyon. I've always wanted to do this, so it's like a dream come true for me.
And then it's home and down to business. I have developed my workout program for people with Parkinson's and had a physical therapist help me fine tune it. I hope to have it launched and in place at the Piedmon Gardens senior center by mid-June. My own health has been stable. I wish my arm and hand were stronger, but I'm working on it. The shaking wouldn't be a problem, but it's just like having a limb that doesn't want to come to the party, won't acknowledge that it's part of your body.
I also joined a free dance class for Parkinson's groups. I'm taking a ballet class with the Mark Morris Dance Company -- two dancers lead a 90-minute workout. It's just awesome.""

Both her mother and grandmother had the disorder, and that's when she learned first-hand how devastating the disease can be for caregivers.",2014-12-31,VOICES,"One evening Leeza Gibbons, the celebrated radio and TV personality, was out to dinner with her mother. She told me in an interview once that after dinner her mother went out and got in the wrong car. It didn't even look like Leeza's car. Then they went to her home, which her mother had visited hundreds of times. After a few minutes she said, ""This is such a beautiful place. Is there a room for me here?"" After two years of being in denial, Leeza finally had to face the cold hard truth. Her mother had dementia.
While she does have a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, Leeza is also a powerful star in the world of Alzheimer's caregiving. Both her mother and grandmother had the disorder, and that's when she learned first-hand how devastating the disease can be for caregivers. Leeza says that ""caring for an Alzheimer's patient is a situation that can utterly consume the lives and well-being of the people giving care, just as the disorder consumes its victims.""
In the earlier stages of her illness, Leeza's mother had asked Leeza to tell her story and make it count. So she established the Leeza Gibbons Memory Foundation and launched Leeza's Place. With four locations across the country, Leeza's Place aims to provide a safe, home-like setting where family caregivers feel comfortable with their new caregiving challenges and can put together a team of support and resources to create their own strategy for coping. 
Leeza's Places offer an impressive array of help to caregivers -- presentations and workshops, mentoring, information and referral assistance, a resource library, support groups, help with making videos about family histories, and arts and crafts that can help reduce caregiver stress. She states that ""if caregivers are not healthy, mentally well-balanced and spiritually sound, then those for whom they care will suffer.""
The centers also provide opportunities for caregivers to increase their energy. These include alternative healing methods, health and wellness programs, social gatherings and events, exercise activities and an online community and caregiver support blog.
""Alzheimer's caregivers are heroes,"" says Leeza. ""It's such an incredibly difficult and isolating job. We need to provide a life raft to these people who are in a river of pain which quickly turns into a tsunami. We can change the world of Alzheimer's caregiving if we focus on this population. I want to establish care connections - caregiver relationships with each other, with resources and with 'sanity sanctuaries', where they can revive their spirits."" 
In 2009, just a year after her mother's death, Leeza published a book, Take Your Oxygen First. Co-authored by James Huysman, PhD, and Rosemary DeAngelis Laird, MD, it provides information about memory loss and is packed with advice for caregivers about how to take care of their bodies, their minds and their spirits. It also has a special section with photographs where Leeza tells the story of her family's struggle with her mother's condition. She says to ""consider this book a visit to Leeza's Place."" 
Take Your Oxygen First is a book all Alzheimer's caregivers should read. I only wish I had it during the seven long years I was taking care of my soul mate, Ed. It would have compelled me to take better care of my own health and might have helped me understand and deal with my anguish over losing the wonderful man I had admired and loved for so long. 
As described in my own book, Come Back Early Today: A Memoir of Love, Alzheimer's and Joy, I endured an incredible amount of physical and emotional stress. Like Leeza and most other caregivers, I had days when I didn't know how much longer I could continue. However, there were some joyous days, too, and I still remember those special moments and how they helped me get through what was the most challenging period of my life. 
Leeza says the most stressful aspect of her mother's illness was ""not being able to fix it. I was a middle child and was used to negotiating. But there was nothing I could do to reverse my mother's condition. I felt so helpless. Looking back now I can see I spent entirely too much time trying to make it all go away.""
""As stressful and painful as it was, however, there were light moments, too,"" says Leeza. ""Early on, mother had insisted she didn't want to live with any of us kids. So when the time came to move her to a caregiving facility we started packing up her belongings. We found a leopard bikini and put it aside, telling her she wouldn't need it. She told us adamantly, 'You don't know what I'm going to need there. I'm taking it!'""
Leeza Gibbons' book, her foundation, and the four locations of Leeza's Place are all amazing resources for caregivers. You can learn more at www.leezasplace.org.

385,FIFTY,About To Retire? Here's Why You Should Consider a Reverse Mortgage Home Loan,"Michael Lazar, ContributorContributor: ReadyCloud.com | Content-Author.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/about-to-retire-heres-why_b_10431662.html,,2016-06-12,VOICES,"Retirees in today's market have many things to consider. Namely, what does the future hold and will you have enough income and assets to persevere.
Aside from any investments, savings and assets that you have, a commonly overlooked but beneficial method may be your home equity. Can a reverse mortgage home loan be a viable tool in retirement? Here are three reasons why.
Getting Rid Of Payments
Chances are that you already have an existing mortgage, and that you also have an existing monthly payment. With a reverse mortgage, these payments would go away. You'd have access to your equity and you'd not be making a payment until after your death; when the balance due is covered by the sale of your home, with the leftover funds going to those as outlined in your will.
No Income/Credit Requirements 
You don't have to worry about proving income or having a high credit score with a reverse mortgage home loan. These loans are based upon the qualifying age of 62 or older, and evidence that you can maintain the home, pay the taxes and the insurance.
You will have to undergo third-party credit counseling first. And you will have to show that you can maintain your home, pay taxes and insurance. But you won't have to prove income, credit or assets, which makes these loans a bit more convenient.
You Keep Your Home
Provided that you maintain the home as your primary residence and follow the agreements of your loan, you keep your home. This means maintaining the home in a typical fashion and making sure that property taxes and insurance are paid in a timely manner.
Reverse mortgages are usually offered in a variety of forms with the ability to take a lump sum, a monthly payout, a line of credit or a combination. They can be a powerful financial vehicle when in retirement that gives you access to money when you need it and as you need it.
A mortgage of any kind is a big financial decision, one that should be well thought out in advance. Make sure you consult with your financial advisor to gain qualified advice before making a decision to take one of these loans out.

The woman takes two wiry black hairs from a vial and dips them in water. She then puts them on a sheet of white paper.

Two earnest men look on. She is telling a fortune with those hairs...how, I'm not quite sure.
It's Sunday in the laidback Malaysian city of Kota Kinabalu. Families trundle strollers past stalls of gamelans (a percussive instrument), curved knives, mulberry tea and squishy sea creatures kept moist in tanks. It's all here: dogs, cats, chickens, carved totems and a slick little man with a headset selling miracle cures.
This street -- Jalan Gaya -- is famous for this weekly market, but you won't see many white faces. Expats in KK (as Kota Kinabalu is called) are a discreet bunch. You won't find the social clubs and lively art and restaurant scene of Malaysia's most popular retirement haven, Penang.  Pier View in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia But KK has much to offer. And there are foreign retirees here. This is the gateway to Malaysian Borneo and the thrills and adventure of Asia's largest island.

Elephants, orangutans, fruit bats, gibbons, clouded leopards and crocodiles ... 3,000 types of tree, 15,000 species of flowering plant ... extensive coral reefs ... spend your days exploring nature and your evenings at the movies or dining on the waterfront promenade.
Costs are low. You'll rent from as little as $450 -- that's short-term and flexible -- and added to that your monthly costs range from $800 to $2,000 depending on the lifestyle you chose. Eat out often in western-style restaurants and buy imported western goods and you'll be at the higher end. But where's the fun in that? Hainanese-style chicken and rice orhinava, a traditional ceviche-style dish of the Kadazan-Dusun people, are the perfect low-cost way to fill up.

The latter were the region's most feared headhunters, and there was a time that no young man of the tribe could marry until he had collected a head. But you're safe these days -- very safe in KK -- and you can take a day trip from town to visit with these people and even stay the night in their traditional longhouses.
 Orangutan in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia Then there are the many festivals...Chinese New Year was in full swing when I visited. Many of the city's million or so population are of Chinese descent, along with Malays and Filipinos.
KK won't wow you with architectural wonders. Much of the city was destroyed in Allied bombing during the war. From some angles, it looks like the set of a 1960s Bond movie. The waterfront promenade is pleasant though, and you'll find traditional craft shops painted pastel yellow. It's a walkable place. But as temperatures average 28 C year-round, a good tip is to discover the shortcuts through the many air-conditioned shopping centers.
These shopping centers house all the big brands, gourmet coffee shops and food courts you could want. A visit to the food court in the Suria shopping centre is particularly worthwhile. Apart from the wide range of good eats at low prices (I had lunch for three bucks) you'll find a long balcony with views of the ocean and the islands offshore.
In fact, an easy day-trip is the 15-minute boat ride out to Sapi island where you can spend the day snorkelling. Gaya is the biggest island and offers trekking and white sands. It's only 10-minutes away and boats for both islands leave from Jesselton Ferry Terminal right beside the Suria shopping centre.  Ocean View in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia Rentals are easy to find. I saw several buildings around town dedicated to serviced apartments. Close to the waterfront you can rent by the day or the month in Marina Court. Online rates start from $750 a month but my contact told me you can get a place there for as little as $450 if you come in person. And that includes electricity and water.
Buildings are shooting up around KK. I viewed one small apartment for sale at $105,000. But renting makes the most sense. Sure, some entrepreneurial sorts have set up tourism businesses, bars and restaurants. You can find Aussie, Italian and even Hungarian food. But for most folks, KK is probably at its best as an attractive base for a part-time, roving retirement.
If, down the line, you feel like making this laidback city your permanent home, then it's worth mentioning you'll find good, affordable healthcare here.
From the city's airport, you can take advantage of fierce competition among low-cost airlines. Get to Bali in two-and-a-half hours, Singapore or the Philippines in just over two hours, and Taiwan in three hours.

387,FIFTY,5 Reasons Why North American Retirees Are Flocking To Mexico,"Suzan Haskins and Dan Prescher, ContributorInternationalLiving.com Editors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/retire-in-mexico_b_11594580.html,"Current estimates put the number of U.S. and Canadian citizens living in various places in Mexico at well over one million. Not all are retired, but hundreds of thousands of them are.",2016-08-27,VOICES,"Current estimates put the number of U.S. and Canadian citizens living in various places in Mexico at well over one million. Not all are retired, but hundreds of thousands of them are.  Beach in Cancun, Mexico This easily makes Mexico the world's most popular overseas retirement destination for U.S. and Canadian citizens.
Remember, this is the country that one U.S. presidential candidate thinks is so bad that it should be walled off from the rest of North America.
What makes so many North Americans disagree? What makes Mexico the world's biggest draw for U.S. and Canadian citizens looking outside their own countries for a quality retirement?
We can think of five reasons off the top of our heads.
The Weather -- The only place you'll find snow in Mexico is on the tops of mountains. Otherwise, the weather in the entire country is temperate to hot. Mexico's Pacific, Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf Coast beaches are justifiably famous for their warmth and beauty, and in Mexico's interior highlands, you'll find dozens of communities where North America retirees enjoy warm days and cool nights all year around. No snow to shovel, ever.  Outdoor Cafe in Merida, Mexico  Proximity to U.S. and Canada -- Mexico is the nearest neighbor to the U.S. and one country away from Canada. This makes getting back home for any reason quick, simple, and affordable. There are hundreds of direct flights from major airports in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Puerto Vallarta, Merida, Cancun, and other Mexican hubs to major U.S. cities every day. (And more are coming. The U.S. and Mexico just signed a treaty to allow even more direct flights between even more cities in the two countries.) And much of Mexico is close enough that many U.S. and Canadian retirees drive to their Mexican winter quarters or second homes.
Great Medical Care -- In Mexico's major metropolitan areas, medical facilities are world class, and medical care costs significantly less than in the U.S. And entrepreneurs in Mexico are fully aware of the draw that good medical care has for U.S. and Canadian retirees... New facilities are being built and older facilities upgraded throughout Mexico to cater to foreign retirees. 
Lower Cost of Living -- It can cost much less to live in Mexico than it does in the U.S. or Canada. Weather has a lot to do with this... If you live somewhere with mild, year-around weather, utility costs naturally go down. But other costs are lower as well, including health insurance and medical care, rents, and the cost of real estate. (Annual property taxes in Mexico are rarely more than $200.) There are certainly some areas of Mexico very popular with U.S. and Canadian tourists and retirees where prices are on par with those up north, but it doesn't take much looking once on the ground to find extremely reasonable rents and real estate prices outside the tourist and ""gringo"" zones. (By the way, the Mexican peso has been trading at close to 18 pesos to the U.S. dollar for some time now, making this the most affordable time in recent memory to be spending dollars in Mexico.)  Colorful Sidestreet in Tequisquiapan, Mexico Wonderful Cultures -- Mexico has its own brand identity, and even people who have never been anywhere in the country think they know what Mexico is like. But it's a big country, and the difference between the culture in Merida and the culture in Puerto Vallarta is as vast as the difference between Virginia Beach and Portland or Montreal and Vancouver. The music, the food, the clothing, the attitudes ... there is so much cultural variety that thinking of Mexico as nothing but mariachis and tacos is like thinking of the U.S. as nothing but hip hop and burgers or of Canada as nothing but Celine Dion and poutine. Mexicans are proud of their national heritage, but they are just as likely as other North Americans to think of themselves in terms of their city, region, or state as anything else.
So it's no surprise to us that North American retirees have made Mexico their #1 destination. We've lived in three different communities in Mexico and have visited nearly every Mexican state, so the charms of Mexico are obvious to us.
And let us hasten to add that we have rarely felt unsafe or in danger anywhere we've lived or traveled in Mexico.
A number of factors have combined to cause terrible violence in some parts of the country, mostly due to conflicts over control of various aspects of the illegal drug trade. Having the largest and most profitable market on the planet for illegal drugs just across its northern border has not helped Mexico overcome its problems with drug-related crime.
But we are not involved in the production, sale, and distribution of drugs, and neither are the vast majority of expats living and working in Mexico. Statistically, many areas of Mexico are safer than areas of comparable populations in the U.S. and Canada. Those are the areas we've lived in, and those are the areas most U.S. and Canadian retirees live in. Safely.
So we guess there are actually six reasons that Mexico is the top destination for U.S. and Canadian citizens looking for a more affordable, high-quality retirement than they can get back home. And remember, Mexico is part of North America ... No wall will stop us from doing business with, retiring to, or enjoying the cultural richness and opportunities of our southern partner.

""I thought at the time, 'Gee, had she looked at our checkbook?', because I didn't really think we could afford to do something like this,"" Michael said. ""The short version of the story is she was able to tell us about Airbnb and that we could travel for less money than we had ever imagined, and so we started looking into it, and by July 2013, we were on the road.""

389,FIFTY,How To Turn Your Inner Critic Into Your Biggest Cheerleader,"Laura Munson, ContributorLaura Munson is a New York Times best-selling author and the f...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/find-self-awareness-_b_6858582.html,"Most of us are not even aware of that voice that lives inside us, viciously so. Unfortunately, I have been in a long-term abusive relationship with my Inner Critter for years.  My Inner Critter poses as an Ivy League tweed-clad professor, and I tend to assign immediate power to anyone boasting to have a ""smart"" bespectacled academic Joycean opinion, especially about writing.",2015-03-22,VOICES,"I recently had a woman come on my Haven Writing Retreat and say, ""I learned more in five days of Haven than in my entire MFA program... and I'm still paying it off six years later!"" I hear this sort of overture all too often, and it concerns me. I also hear, ""I'm still chiseling my way out of my college Creative Writing classes and some of the emotional damage I endured there."" Same goes for many writing workshops that people take in hopes of learning more about their unique voice and how to cultivate it through craft, feedback and the help of a strong teacher. 
It takes guts, putting yourself out there like that. And it saddens me that while there are so many incredible teachers and writing programs, so many people come in to an instructional writing environment with their hearts in their hands, shivering a bit in their boots, taking a leap of faith with the belief that they will be held responsibly by the experience and the people in it...only to have their guts gutted. Not on my watch!
My approach is to help people take that heart-in-the-hand and turn it into heart language... and that is a very delicate process. Feedback is something that comes second. First, we must learn to have the courage to find our most white hot triggering subjects, to free-fall into them, to surface with words on the page and share them out loud without scrutiny, to simply have them heard, to trust that in-so-doing we are helping others to cultivate their ear, and to finally understand once and for all that our voice is unique. It's real. It matters. And that massive act doesn't start with creating something that we splay open for people to feast on or send back to the kitchen.
It all begins with self-awareness.
Sounds lofty? It isn't. I hear over and over people saying, ""I'm stuck,"" or ""Why does my writing even matter? or ""Who do I think I am? Nobody asked me to write,"" or ""I'm not good enough."" And do you know who is delivering up those words? The inner critic. (I like to call it the Inner Critter.) Most of us are not even aware of that voice that lives inside us, viciously so. Unfortunately, I have been in a long-term abusive relationship with my Inner Critter for years. My Inner Critter poses as an Ivy League tweed-clad professor, and I tend to assign immediate power to anyone boasting to have a ""smart"" bespectacled academic Joycean opinion, especially about writing. For years, I allowed that old sod to rule the roost in my writing chair. Then one day I heard someone say, ""You wouldn't treat your worst enemy the way you treat yourself in your own mind."" I realized: That's who I've become. That's what's in my way. I am my own worst enemy. I hadn't even been aware of it until that moment. It wasn't that I ever, for one second, stopped writing. It was that I hadn't given myself permission to understand that no one on earth can write like I can. It's not possible. Each writer's voice is as unique as a snowflake. Or a grain of sand. Or a finger print. Or your Grandma's apple pie.
So I declared war.
For awhile, I tried to exorcise the Inner Critter into the Inner Critter Sh**ter, deeming her the enemy and treating her thusly. That didn't work. Because even though she was a confluence of many people and institutions of my life, I'd created her, invited her to live in my mind, and fed her the fat along with the lean. Declaring war on her meant that I was in a war with myself. Not a great place from which to tease the muse. The muse just stood there chewing gum twirling her keys, waiting for me to get a clue. Turns out, she has really great keys to really great worlds as long as I know how to take care of what goes on in my mind. The inherent problem with this was that not only hadn't I been aware of how I was treating myself in my mind, I also had become used to it. And habits are hard to break. In all honesty, the Inner Critter liked living in my mind (why wouldn't she-- such five star accommodations?) and frankly, she was a better fighter than I was.
So I took another tack: I decided that the Inner Critter was really just a scared little girl that lives inside me with a large megaphone to my heart. And if my daughter came in to my room in the middle of the night raging over a bad dream I wouldn't kick her out. I'd hug her, love her, calm her until she went back to sleep. I tried it, and it worked! I learned to daily lullaby my Inner Critter into a long nap so that my muse and I could unlock the world of possibility I so longed to explore. To enter, and to play! We knew how to do this when we were children. We just lose our way a little (or a lot) as we go.
I believe that we need to begin here if we are to paint that world with the broad strokes of a Creator all the way to the exacting Pointillism that shows the holy in the mundane-- the nouns our hands touch. It takes heart-in-the-hand-self-aware-guts to go at this thing called the Writing Life. And once we have all of this in its right place... we can start to know what Picasso meant when he said, ""If they took away my paints I'd use pastels. If they took away my pastels I'd use crayons. If they took away my crayons I'd use pencils. If they stripped me naked and threw me in prison I'd spit on my finger and paint on the walls."" Or what Michelangelo meant when he said that the sculpture was in the stone; it was his job to release it.
Once we are in that free place of creation, we begin to hunger for our voices. Why? Because we are in a natural flow. Once we are in that flow, it even gets easy. We're no longer in our way. We understand that with every single thing we write, there is an inherent problem. Of course there is. Our job is to find the problem and solve it. The Inner Critter can't scare us with this challenge any more. 
We understand that with every story and every character, real or imagined, there is conflict, and that conflict is blessed terrain. It's where all the good questions and good answers live. Once we have solved a few of these writerly ""problems"" and rolled around in the conflict that they embody...what was once scary now becomes our guide into the great wilderness of the world we are drawing with our words. Then we are ready to give and receive feedback for our work. Then we can get into the elements of style like plot arc, characterization, narrative drive. Then we can get into the scenes and breathe our characters alive. Then we can allow their minds to be in the clouds, and their feet to be on the ground. Then we can show exactly who they are in the way they make a bed. We don't need to tell a thing. It's all shown. It's all there. We've released the sculpture from the stone. And the heart of the world we've created...beats all on its own.

The awards, now in their 26th year, honor chefs who have been cooking in their own kitchen for five years or less. Past years' winners have included David Chang, Thomas Keller, Grant Achatz and Danny Bowien. Food & Wine announced the Best New Chefs of 2014 earlier today. 
In a continuing effort to speak to a millennial audience (the magazine launched FWx, a new division strictly targeting millennials, earlier this year ), Food & Wine revealed the best new chefs over Instagram. Editor-in-chief Dana Cowin posted selfies -- yes, selfies -- with each chef.
Geography and gender both play notable roles in this year's awards. Three of the chefs are from Texas, one is from Brooklyn and exactly none are from Manhattan. Is this a ""new world order?"" asked Andrew Friedman of Toqueland on Twitter. 
While Food & Wine's attention to chefs outside of Manhattan may represent a positive, progressive posture, the attention paid to female chefs is lacking. Of all the years in which honoring women would be important, this is it. The unequal media attention given to male chefs over female ones is hardly a new subject. As it pertains to Food & Wine's Best New Chefs awards, qualms over the dearth of women represented aren't new either. This would have been the year to address the subject head on.
After TIME Magazine's November ""Gods of Food"" feature, the food and media world have reignited the conversation over women chefs with new vigor. Following the completely out-of-touch feature, a beautiful backlash ensued, where female chefs and non-chefs, publications and industry insiders voiced their discontent. The New York Times ran a discussion in its ""Room for Debate"" section asking ""Why do female chefs get overlooked,"" and since then the paper has examined the continued visibility problem of the female chef. Just recently the Times profiled acclaimed Boston-based chef Barbara Lynch. 
Julia Moskin's article ""A Change in the Kitchen"" found that 30 to 50 percent of the culinary staff in some of the country's fastest growing restaurant groups are women. However, ""one big question -- why even women who make it to the top rank of chefs struggle for recognition -- has often been posed, and never fully answered.""
While we wholeheartedly applaud this year's winners, we wish we saw more than two women honored in this group of 12. To be fair, as Moskin's article notes, more women are increasingly occupying the second- or third-tier jobs, like chef de cuisine and executive sous-chef, and Food & Wine's qualifications require a chef to be leading the kitchen in order to win the award. The problem is both a lack of media visibility and too few women in the role of head chef. Bloomberg News analyzed 15 prominent U.S. restaurant groups and found that women held only 6.3 percent of head chef positions. We hope next year's awards reflect a different reality.
Here are Food & Wine's best new chefs of 2014:
Justin Yu, Oxheart, Houston Cara Stadler, Tao Yuan, Brunswick ME Greg Denton and Gabrielle Quinonez Denton, Ox, Portland, OR Matthew Accarrino, SPQR, San Francisco Paul Qui, Qui, Austin, TX Eli Kulp, Fork, Philadelphia Ari Taymor, Alma, Los Angeles Dave Beran, Next, Chicago Matt McCallister, FT33, Dallas Walker Stern and Joe Ogrodnek, Dover, Brooklyn

I have teamed up with the awesome BarChick ladies to bring you a definitive A-Z guide of eating and drinking in London -- Mighty Spice vs. BarChick. I do the food, and they do the booze. Enjoy.
This week we are looking at what is hot right now from U to Z.
U Is For  Udon noodles at Koya: This awesome Japanese restaurant has a killer menu that focuses on the humble udon noodle. They have nailed it -- the perfect noodle in perfect broth. My favourite is the Buto Miso -- hot porky broth filled with their wonderful noodles, which is perfect for a cold wintery day! 

Underground Bars: There's no escaping winter, unless you head down to one of London's underground bars. Cellar Door, El Camion, Purl, Lucky Chip at The Player and Happiness Forgets are open for you to head down to drink the cold night  away... and hibernate until summer.

  V Is For  Viajante: Watch the fabulous Nuno Mendes go in his flagship London restaurant Viajante, in the exceptionally beautiful art-deco Town Hall Hotel in Bethnal Green. The food is rocking and the drinks in the bar are pretty awesome, too! Seats are hard to come by, but never fear, he has a smaller, no-reservations restaurant called Corner Room that you can sneak into.

Views: we love getting high as much as we love keeping it local, so neighbouring Paramount always gets our vote. The views over London are stunning and the cocktails don't just rely on the impressiveness of the sights. Take a date for Champagne and they're in the bag.   
  W Is For Wagu beef at 34 Restaurant: This stunning restaurant in Mayfair offers some of the best steaks in town. The Australian Wagu beef they use is simply divine and their 280g rib eye melts in the mouth. 34 is very flash, and at £75 for the rib eye you need to make sure you have some serious cash before booking! 
Whiff Waff, AKA Ping Pong: This craze is taking over the city, move over bowling. Bounce has just opened in the same building that the game was originally founded with over 17 tables (including one from the Olympics), then in West London you've got Ping and then there's PingTron (that's UV ping-pong people) -- get your bat and let's play!  
X Is For  Xhacutti: This is a classic Goan chicken dish made with loads of spices. It is served best at Ma Goa in West London. You can head there for some Goan sunshine any time -- people, their food is unbelievable!  X-Rated: there are some seriously x-rated performances at The Box, so get ready to be shocked. Everyone should go here at least once, if you can work out how to get in that is...

  Y Is For  Yalla Yalla: With two chains offering cheap and very cheerful Lebanese street food, these guys are doing things extremely right. Their wraps are fantastic, and I love their hummus topped with thin slices of lamb fillet. 

Yolks, leftover that is: With pisco taking over the city in the form of all the latest Peruvian hangouts (Lima and Ceviche, to name a few), there are a lot more Pisco Sours being made. They use the whites but not the yolks, so it usually ends up in the staff food.

Z Is For  Zedel: Brasserie Zedel opened up just off Piccadilly Circus over the summer. It's a mega art-deco Parisian brasserie doing top-notch French food that loves your wallet. Dine in style in the opulent surroundings and be sure to have a martini in the cabaret bar The Crazy Coqs after. 

Zetter Townhouse: This place rocks before you've even had a drink! Stuffed kangaroo, check. Stuffed cat with parasol, check. Tincture of gunpowder in your drink, check. The drinks are seasonal and are the brainwork of the legendary Tony C. It doesn't get much better.

We knew there would be some interesting stuff, and that the recipes found inside would most likely mimic their quirky covers. But what we didn't expect was to find such different recipes -- different being the best adjective we could come up with for what we found (since we couldn't find a word that describes disgusting, creative, fascinating, eye-catching, nauseating, repulsive, appetizing, historical and inventive all at once).
It's hard to know what to take away from the sights inside some of these vintage cookbooks, though one thing most people can agree on is that they're not recipes we want to try. With dishes that mix deviled ham, pickles and peanut butter together, it's not hard to understand why. (Though there are a few brave home cooks who seem to find delight in cooking these retired dishes, such as the blogger at Mid-Century Menu.) 
While we aren't sad to see these recipes go -- and we're certainly not trying to bring them back -- we are in awe by their ""different-ness."" And so we've put together a slideshow of our favorites to share. Take a look and tell us what you think.

The WineFashionista",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/when-in-piemonte-italy-th_us_5b9da545e4b03a1dcc8ab8ef,"With Roberta Ceretto Roberta feels it is a different experience to come to Italy, to Piemonte and see the vineyards and the",2013-11-06,ARTS & CULTURE,"
Going to wine country in Italy is not quite like visiting Napa Valley or Sonoma County in California. While things are getting easier for wine tourists, you just can't show up and expect to be able to go taste at any winery you want to. The concept of a tasting room open daily to visitors is still something that's not as common in the region that is home to Barolo and Barbaresco. But one winery has recognized the need for opening its doors to wine lovers. That's why you can visit the Ceretto winery and be treated not only to great wine but eye-catching art too.


The main Ceretto winery is in Alba, just outside of the historic downtown area. The building was a farmhouse that belonged to Vittorio Emanuele II, the famous king who ruled the newly unified Italy in the mid 1800s. Now it is the Ceretto Monsordo Bernardina winery.

""We we decided to produce a space here that was open seven days a week,"" says Roberta Ceretto, our guide for our visit. ""We copied exactly the example of Napa Valley and this has become one of the most visited wineries because it is always open. She calls it a blend of ""an artistic installation and wine tasting."" That's because the architecture of the building is unusual, unexpected, and very modern. There's a big bubble - called the Acino -- that extends out, cantilevered over the vineyards, to give you an almost 360 degree view of the vines. It's a cool observation deck, intended to look like a single grape.

Putting Arneis on the Map
I had the great pleasure of visiting with Roberta, third generation vintner at her family's winery, known not just for Barolo and Barbaresco, but also for Arneis, a white wine from the Roero district of Piemonte, a wine her family singlehandedly made famous. Her grandfather Riccardo began the winery in Alba in the 1930's. Roberta's uncles Bruno and Marcello joined Riccardo in the late 50's and early 60's and began to make innovations, including purchasing estate vineyards.
Courtesy Ceretto
If you like Italian white wines, you may have had a glass or a bottle of Ceretto Blangé Arneis, I've had it many times in the states; it enjoys a world wide reputation and distribution. ""That is our most successful wine,"" says Roberta.
""It is a wine that really has written a chapter in the enology of this district because it is a white and so very unusual because when you imagine Piemonte you associate it with big important red wines. The intention was to choose a grape that was local and invest in it. Now Blangé represents 50% of our total production, around 1 million bottles.""
Moscato Champions
Ceretto also produces a wonderful Moscato d'Asti, the slightly sweet, effervescent wine. Moscato is enjoying immense popularity right now in the U.S. but Ceretto has been a champion of the style produced in Asti for many years. ""It's a wine that was born for a special feeling because my family originally comes from the district of Moscato,"" Roberta says. ""My grandfather was born there, also my father so at the end of the 70's they looked for something different something to combine with Barolo and Barbaresco and they thought about Moscato. It's a versatile wine that you can enjoy it as an aperitif, or with dessert.""
Courtesy Ceretto
Hazelnuts and Nougat
One of the best Moscato pairings I've ever had was with Ceretto's Moscato d'Asti and the hazelnut torrone that Ceretto makes from the hazelnuts grown on its property. I did not know that after grapes and white truffles, hazelnuts are the next biggest agricultural crop in Alba. Torrone is made with toasted hazelnuts, honey, sugar, and vanilla. Ceretto sells  torrone at their tasting room so if you visit, do not miss it.
Hazelnut trees at Ceretto
Art in the Vineyard
We go to visit the Ceretto winery in Barolo, Bricco Rocche, where the high end DOCG Barolos are produced. Here is another art gallery, a very modern glass cube. ""We are in the middle of the Barolo district,"" says Roberta. ""All around there are Barolo vines and on the top of the hill there is this gigantic transparent cube that has become kind of a landmark of Barolo.""


The day of our visit, an installation by the local artist Valerio Berruti fills the cube with panels with images of children, creating a carousel that you walk around to view. The panels are gigantic and you look up, down and all around, with the rolling hills of Barolo as the backdrop.

Our next stop is closer to the village of Barolo, in Ceretto's Brunate vineyard where a very special work of art resides. It is the Sol LeWitt and David Tremlett Chapel, created in 1999 as a collaboration between the two world renown artists. The original chapel building, built in 1914, had never been consecrated, so the chapel, which by the late '90s was in disrepair was renovated and given new life, with Tremlett painting the interior murals and LeWitt adding the bright, colorful designs on the exterior. If you know where to look, you can see this splashy building from many places in Barolo. Roberta says people come from all over the world just to see the chapel, and on this day we were not the only visitors.




Over the years, art and wine have become ever more important at Ceretto. ""It's something that's become a second job for me,"" says Roberta.
""I believe that contemporary art and wines like Barolo and Barbaresco have many points in common because they need to be always explained. It's impossible that you can appreciate a Barbaresco or Barolo and enjoy it immediately. It's exactly the same with a piece of contemporary art. You need always someone who tells you a the story.""


The Ceretto family also believes food is an art form. They own Piazza Duomo in the heart of Alba, a three star Michelin restaurant. The pink interior walls are adorned with a mural by Francesco Clemente . ""We are trying to create an attraction so art, architecture and food are all part of this attraction,"" Roberta explains.

Roberta feels it is a different experience to come to Italy, to Piemonte and see the vineyards and the winery and taste the wine and enjoy it with the local cuisine. ""The very secret of this unique setting in Piemonte is the soil. It is the only place where Nebbiolo can grow in that way to produce great Barolo and Barbaresco."" This is what she wants you to come experience on a visit to Ceretto.

Looking for something different to marinate them in, I went back to Jeff Parker's great grilling site and found this recipe he used to make Szechuan pulled pork. It makes a little too much marinade for a couple of chops, but hey... • 1 large clove garlic, run through a garlic press • 1/4 cup soy sauce • 1/4 cup rice vinegar • 2 tablespoons peanut oil • 1 tablespoon Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry • 1 tablespoon brown sugar • 1 tablespoon Szechuan peppercorns, toasted and ground • 2 bone-in pork chops (about ¾ pound each) Mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl. Put the pork chops in a Ziploc bag, add the marinade, seal and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Remove the chops from the refrigerator an hour before you want to cook them and allow to come to room temperature. Grill over medium-high heat for about 4 minutes a side, depending on the thickness of your chops. Serve and enjoy! My verdict: It doesn't get much easier than this marinade! Jeff's got a sauce for his pulled pork that sounds great, but these chops were just delicious (perfectly grilled by my husband) with just the marinade! Toasting and grinding the Szechuan peppercorns add a nice depth of flavor to them and only takes about a minute. You pop them in a small frying pan over medium-high heat for a minute until they just start to smell fragrant. You can do them in the microwave on a plate for a minute or two, but since it can be a slim margin between toasted and toast, I like the control I have with a frying pan. I deviated from Jeff's recipe and added garlic-a little fresh ginger, grated, might go in the next time. Don't think you can substitute regular peppercorns for the Szechuan ones, not even close!

398,FOOD & DRINK,The Great Wine & Food Matching Myth,"Leora Kalikow, Contributor
Director of Communications, Public House Wine",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wine-and-food-pairing_us_5b9d94bce4b03a1dcc89ca74,"There are no food and wine pairing rules, only guidelines.",2013-10-09,ARTS & CULTURE,"There is no wine and food matching. That's all a big delusion. All the principles of wine and food matching are a complex set of metaphors that actually have no basis whatsoever. I'm just saying 'Stop it!'
Master of Wine Tim Hanni has been leading the crusade to debunk wine and food pairing myths for years now. Through extensive scientific study, Hanni has found that many traditional food pairings -- like red wine and meat, or white wine and fish -- do not actually enhance the flavor of either food group.
Wine and foods have been paired and matched since the early 20th century, and possibly even before. But as commercial wine culture exploded in the 1980s and 90s,  basic wine and food pairing ""rules"" were invented and promoted to further the purchase of wine.
Hanni describes many of these rules as ""well-intentioned,"" and rooted in rationale. For example, it is widely espoused that red meat softens the effect of tannic red wine, hence the classic steak-and-cabernet combination. Hanni's studies however, prove that it's actually the salt in the steak rather than the steak itself that softens the bitterness of the tannins. 
But not all food and wine combinations are baseless. Hanni believes that it is the way the primary flavors interact together -- sweet, sour, salty, umami and bitter -- that will predict the palatial experience. Additionally, the more exaggerated the attributes of a wine, the more intense that reaction with food will be.

Hanni writes, ""in the simplest terms, sweet and umami tastes predominating in a dish will render a wine thin, bitter, sour and unpleasant while salt and acidity in the food will make the accompanying wine richer or smooth, or taken to the extreme, flat and flabby.""
For instance, the combination of high acid white wine and oysters will not inherently enhance the flavor of either food, rather the vinegar based mignonette that dresses the oyster that will make a high acid wine taste balanced.
So where does this leave us?
There is some truth to the science of food and wine pairing, but only in how the primary flavors relate to one another. That being said, even without scientific evidence in support, there is still something appealing, and even nostalgic, about pairing food and wine. You wouldn't side a rotisserie chicken with mango or pineapple the way you would a fish taco -- not because it would harm the flavor of the dish, but because the taco is reminiscent of a place warm and tropical, while rotisserie chicken is reminiscent of a meal homey and hearty. 
Wine, like food, still represents and recreates a sense of time or place. Like a choice of side dish or table setting, it can set the ambience for the meal. 
The bottom line: There are no food and wine pairing rules, only guidelines. And if adhering to wine and food pairing rituals elevates your eating experience, you should continue to do so -- science be damned.

399,FOOD & DRINK,Top 10 Foods on British Menus Starts With Burgers,"Scott Hume, Contributor
Editor, BurgerBusiness.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/top-10-foods-on-british-m_us_5b9d7327e4b03a1dcc8822d3,"Burgers are the most commonly found food on increasingly Americanized British menus, reports London-based researcher Horizons' 2013 Menurama survey.",2013-08-20,ARTS & CULTURE,"Burgers are the most commonly found food on increasingly Americanized British menus, reports London-based researcher Horizons' 2013 Menurama survey. 
That Americanization extends to cost-cutting measures: Burgers average 6.35 ounces, a 17 percent decrease from the 7.69-oz. average found in the summer of 2010. Still burgers showed a 13 percent increase in menu listings in the past year.
The decrease in size hasn't made burgers cheap: The average menu price (including pubs, restaurant and hotels) is £9.27 (US$14.53) according to Menurama. Shown below: A hefty burger with chorizo relish at Gourmet Burger Kitchen (GBK) in London.

The top 10 entrées on British menus are beef burger, pizza, chicken burger, fish & chips, rump steak, roast chicken, rib-eye steak, chicken curry, sirloin steak and Sunday lunch (roast).
Horizons reports that the U.S. fascination with upscale hot dogs is taking hold in the UK. Hot dogs are on 85 percent more menus than just one year ago. Hot dogs have joined the top 20 menu items, bumping traditional British favorite scampi & chips. Pub chain Marston's has added an American-influenced Mac 'n Cheese Hot Dog. One reason for the growth may be price: Hot dogs average £6.12 (US$9.59) on British menus.
 ""Against a backdrop of rising food costs and squeezed consumer spend, the reduction in weight of key meat dishes demonstrates that operators are having to become more savvy with regard to menu and price engineering,"" says Nicola Knight, Horizons director of services. ""This could explain the huge growth in hot dogs on menus they are relatively cheap to produce and operators can easily add value to them enabling them to charge more.""

Horizons' Menurama analyzes menus of 115 chains covering the pub, restaurant, quick-service and hotel segments. Shown above is one of the three locations for British chain Honest Burger. Among the other findings of this year's survey:
Such American foods as pulled pork, chicken wings and ribs show significant growth in the past year. American descriptors and items such as ""black & blue steak,"" ""Cobb salad"" and ""slaw"" have gained acceptance as well.
Use of healthy-eating descriptions declined in Britain during the past year. Horizons' Knight suggests this may be the result of operators steering menus toward more-indulgent offerings.

Of all the mushrooms we love (and there are a lot of them) we probably use shiitake mushrooms the most. The descriptor ""meaty"" gets thrown around a lot when we talk about mushrooms, but shiitakes, more than any other, embody a satisfying umami you can't really get from any other plant-based food. 
As these mushrooms have grown in popularity, they are available fresh in more grocery stores than ever -- it wasn't so long ago when they seemed really exotic and you could only find the dried variety. When using fresh shiitakes, do us one favor: don't throw out the stems. We know that they are too woody to eat. We know that they don't sautée and soften as well as the caps. Cut them off, toss them in a freezer bag and put them into your next vegetable stock. It will taste richer and heartier than any vegetable stock you've ever made, we promise. We love to use shiitakes anywhere you'd use a button or cremini mushrooms, but there are shiitake recipes (often Asian) that highlight this mushroom's flavor especially well.

Today, Tara from Seven Spoons helps us master the art of Blue Cheese Dressing.
For the longest time, I thought I didn't like blue cheese dressing. I'd had too many disappointing versions, often served alongside buffalo wings. Those ones that hit you in the face with an overpowering funk of cheese, and a consistency that could only be described as weirdly plastic. Then I was introduced to the iceberg wedge: the perfect balance of crunch, fat, and cool, bold with a proper blue cheese dressing, and the recipe was forever redeemed. 
Blue cheese dressing can, and should, be brash -- yet still refined. Gutsy with cheese, bright with vinegar, and mollified with a hint of sweetness that’s bolstered by the richness of the mayonnaise and sour cream. It should have body without unnecessary weight. 
I've said it before, but it bears repeating: blue cheese dressing is an art more than a science. As such, the quantities here should be viewed as guidelines to steer you in the right direction, rather than hard and fast rules. Consider how you're going to use the dressing when tweaking both the texture and the seasoning. 
I’ve taken to making thicker blue cheese dressings to slather on burgers or grilled steak. The fat adds even more oomph to the meat, and the cheese has more than enough personality to stand up to some char. It’s also undeniably good with crispy chicken wings. A moderately thick version is just the thing for those beloved chunks of iceberg lettuce, and I make a light, velvety rendition to dress arugula tossed with fresh corn kernels.
Basic Blue Cheese Dressing
Makes about 1 1/2 cups
4 ounces blue cheese, crumbled
2/3 cups mayonnaise
1/4 cup sour cream or thick yogurt
1/4 cup well-shaken buttermilk
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1 teaspoon runny honey
1 tablespoon minced fresh chives, scallions, or garlic scapes
Freshly ground black pepper
Cayenne-based hot sauce, dried red pepper flakes, or chili oil, to serve (optional)
If you like a smooth dressing, grab a medium bowl and mash the blue cheese into the mayonnaise with the back of a fork. If you prefer a chunky dressing, set your blue cheese aside.

Mix the mayonnaise with the sour cream, most of the buttermilk, and all of the vinegar and honey. Add the chives to the bowl, along with the blue cheese, if you're going the chunky route. Fold to combine, and season with pepper. Taste for seasoning, adding more buttermilk, vinegar, honey, or pepper, as necessary.

You can use the dressing right away, but I think it's even nicer after a day in the fridge, which gives the flavors a chance to round out. The dressing will thicken as it sits, but can be thinned with a few drops of water. Serve with a dash of hot sauce. Keep any leftover dressing in an airtight container in the fridge, and use up in a few days.

Within the past few years, coconut water has gone from being a nearly non-existent beverage in the U.S. to a multi-million dollar industry. You can now find this slightly-sweet drink everywhere: vending machines, supermarket shelves and bodegas across the country. 
Touting natural health benefits similar to what you'd get with a sports drink, many athletes turn to coconut water as a way to re-fuel after a workout. While there's some dispute as to how well it can replenish your electrolytes in comparison to more traditional sports drinks, it's generally accepted that coconut water is a great source of rehydration, and some say it can even cure a hangover.
Coconut water is the liquid in the center of a young green coconut. It has long been enjoyed in Latin America and Asia, usually straight from the coconut. It's not to be confused with coconut milk, which is a mixture of coconut meat and water and much richer; coconut water is fat free and lower in calories. 
Some people love the flavor of this drink, and others feel that it tastes like old gym socks. One thing we can say at Kitchen Daily is that it doesn't quite taste as it would if straight from the tropical fruit. If you aren't the biggest fan of coconut water or if you're looking for a way to up your intake, think about incorporating it into your foods. The water adds a nice tropical flavor and a hint of sweetness to dishes. Click through the slideshow below for delicious ideas on how to do this.

The juice of the tomato provides the fish with a nice liquid to bake in and the onion gives a boost of flavor. Asparagus is also a nice option, as are green beans. Just be sure to choose veggies that are quick cooking -- potatoes will not work here.
Lastly, top with fresh herbs of your choice. Parsley and cilantro add a nice fresh flavor. Wrap the fish and veggies with the foil. Place in the oven and bake for 7-10 minutes or until the fish is opaque and flaky. 
Serve with minute rice, and you've just made yourself a healthy and well-balanced meal in less time than it takes to do your hair.

412,FOOD & DRINK,Traditional Ashkenazi Diet Needs Healthy Makeover,"Zester Daily, Contributor
Zester Daily: The culture of food and drink.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ashkenazi-diet-makeover_us_5b9cf75de4b03a1dcc8359c2,"When I wrote Jewish Traditional Cooking, I wanted to include the inherited foods but lighten them where possible.",2013-03-26,ARTS & CULTURE,"
By Ruth Joseph
When I was just married I went with my new husband to a famous Jewish restaurant in London. I scanned the menu anxiously searching for something green.
""Excuse me,"" I asked, ""Do you have any vegetables, please?""
""Yes,"" the waiter answered seriously, ""we have dill pickles and latkes.""
That exchange demonstrates so much of what is wrong with traditional Ashkenazi fare. Certainly the food is delicious, rib-sticking and very tasty. Look at menus solid with dishes like matzo ball soup and kreplach, the delicious triangles of pasta filled with chopped meat floating generously in rich broth. There are slices of corned beef with a liberal side of deep fried potato latkes and over-large slices of lockshen pudding -- noodles mixed with dried fruit and masses of fat and sugar. Of course all these dishes are wonderful and immersed with flavor and Jewish tradition. Lighter versions of some of the recipes form part of my book, Jewish Traditional Cooking. But maybe it would be sensible to serve one of these recipes as a treat or delicacy accompanied by a liberal quantity of vegetables and fruit, not all of them together at a single meal.
Related: Love French food? Thank the Jews. 
The traditional Ashkenazi diet evolved from a fragile East-European existence and the shtetl -- impoverished, flimsy villages. Temperatures were below zero for most of the year and people lived without heating on the edge of subsistence. Probably a grated potato fried in chicken fat would constitute their daily and only meal. Every day was a battle to stay alive and food had to be ultra-substantial to combat those freezing temperatures.
If people were fortunate enough to have a chicken, probably only for a festival, it was an old boiler, and in true Ashkenazi tradition it would have been placed in a large cooking pot with root vegetables and masses of water to make a soup. This soup would be extended with matzo balls or any kind of dough and rough bread, along with chopped gizzards and heart, and meat from the chicken's neck. The neck skin would be separately stuffed with chopped fat and peppery flour and stitched, then roasted with the bird to create another meal called helzel. 
Related: A recipe for righteous rugelach Jewish cookies.  
Those bubbas, grandmothers and mothers, knew that they could keep hunger at bay by adding calorie-laden extras. 
The chicken would likely be served at the festival meal with kasha, rice, potatoes or barley.

We are now in the 21st century and Ashkenazi tradition still follows that regimen. Jewish people manifest significant problems connected with obesity, including the so-called Jewish Disease, diabetes. Heart disease and cancers are known to be exacerbated by a high fat, high protein diet.
So maybe it's time to acknowledge this and accept change, as I did after marrying a lovely Sephardi man. After the Diaspora, the Sephardic Jews looked about their surroundings and adopted the cooking methods of their new neighbors using masses of cheap vegetables and fruits, cooking with olive oil rather than the artery-clogging schmaltz of their Jewish cousins. Instead of relying on frying or interminable stewing to add flavor, they began seasoning their food with fresh herbs, creating fragrant dishes redolent with glorious spices and mouthwatering taste.
Related: When Jewish food was hidden. 
When I wrote Jewish Traditional Cooking, I wanted to include the inherited foods but lighten them where possible. Many of the appetizers are vegetable-based: baba ganoush, a fragrant Asian dish based on oven-roasted vegetables, and soup mit nisht -- the ultimate low-calorie cauliflower soup that tastes of heaven but relies on the freshness of a good cauliflower, onions and a light stock and herbs. Lockshen pudding has exchanged its ancient stodgy image for a healthier alternative by adding masses of freshly grated apple, vanilla, mixed spices and fresh lemon zest.
Passover is no longer a stomach-clutching kilo-raising event in our home. We adore the lightness of a carrot and almond bake which rises soufflé-like for any chef, and the spinach and leek roulade with its lighter cheese filling still satisfies. For a modern Jewish woman understanding tradition and the demands of religion and custom, I looked to Morocco where I learned to cook fish in a tiny Fez kitchen with a mixture of fresh vegetables and a fabulous stuffing so that it can be eaten hot or cold. Turkish tradition showed me how to stuff a whole vegetable and experiment with butternut squash as the base for a stuffing of toasted pine nuts, lentils, brown rice, currants and masses of chopped mint, parsley and cilantro.
I believe that Ashkenazi Jews have to look to their Sephardi cousins to learn how to eat in the 21st century. They may not survive their traditional diet.

On my way back from a week spent on North Haven, a quiet and radiant island in Penobscot Bay, I stopped along Route 1 in Maine to buy wild blueberries, the state's signature fruit.",2012-08-08,ARTS & CULTURE,"Local blueberries are in full harvest mode. On my way back from a week spent on North Haven, a quiet and radiant island in Penobscot Bay, I stopped along Route 1 in Maine to buy wild blueberries, the state's signature fruit. The sign said ""Clean Wild Maine Blueberries,"" and the owner told me that the berries had actually been harvested mechanically, and are cultivated, despite the ""wild"" moniker. Wild blueberrie are much smaller than their pumped-up cousins from New Jersey, which are what we normally see in supermarkets, almost all year round these days. According to Wikipedia, ""wild"" has been adopted as a marketing term for harvests of managed native stands of lowbush blueberries. ""The bushes are not planted or genetically manipulated, but they are pruned or burned over every two years, and pests are managed,"" the entry tells us.
Cleaning the little blue devils can be an exercise in frustration -- you can't exactly get rid of all the teeny, tiny stems and spent berries clinging to them; best to abandon any expectations of getting them all. But each mini-blue pacts an intense blueberry flavor that is well worth the effort. 
The island of North Haven off the coast of Rockland, Maine, may not remain so quiet for long. Food & Wine magazine was there earlier this year to interview the island's one chef, Amanda Hallowell. Hallowell works at one of the island's two restaurants, Nebo Lodge. Mark Bittman ate there not too long ago. 
This delicious and rich recipe for North Haven ""Wild"" Blueberry Tart was written by someone who lived on the island and who adapted the recipe from the cookbook author, Nancy Harmon Jenkins. 
The thick crust is more like a cookie than a pie crust -- a buttery, crunchy oatmeal cookie.
Here's how to make it:
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter at room temperature  1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar  1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract  Salt  Dash of cinnamon  3/4 cup flour  1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon rolled oats  1/4 cup finely chopped almonds--toasted or not, skins on or blanched  3 1/2 cups fresh wild blueberries (see note)  2 tablespoons cornstarch  Grated zest of 1 lemon  2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice  1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar for dusting on cooled tart  Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream (optional)
1. Using a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or with a hand-mixer, cream the butter and 1/3 cup of the sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the vanilla, a pinch of salt and the cinnamon. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the flour, rolled oats and almonds. Shape into a disk, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Press the chilled dough into a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Wrap in plastic and freeze for 30 minutes. It will be a thick dough and not spread evenly in the tart pan--that's OK.
2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Transfer the tart pan directly from the freezer to the oven and bake until the crust is golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, and using paper towels to protect your hands, gently press the hot crust, which will have risen a bit, back into the pan. Cool slightly on a wire rack before adding the berry filling. 
3. Rinse the blueberries, shake them dry in a colander and transfer them to a large bowl. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch with the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar, the lemon zest and a pinch of salt. Stir it and the lemon juice into the berries, bruising the berries slightly with a fork. Transfer the berry mixture to the crust and distribute the berries evenly. Bake in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. 
4. Cool completely on a rack. Sprinkle with the confectioners' sugar and, if you choose, serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Serves 6 to 8. 
NOTE: Do not use frozen blueberries. Domestic blueberries may be substituted for wild. Enjoy!

Emily is known for her absurdly beautiful food photography and coffee co-dependencies on her Jelly Toast Blog. On Food Fanatic, she shares a third addiction: fabulous appetizers.
 Can I talk about how thrilled I am to be sharing a fall recipe with you? Especially when it's these sweet and savory Butternut Squash Tartines. The butternut squash is roasted with maple syrup, rosemary and pears to create the perfect fall combination.
 Fall is by far my favorite season, with its crisp air, wooly sweaters and warm mugs of spiced apple cider, it's truly the highlight of my year. One of my favorite things about fall, however, is the abundance of squash that floods the markets - my favorite being butternut squash.
 I love butternut squash for its sweet flavor and versatility in the kitchen. It can be roasted for a simple side dish, pureed into soups and even used in desserts, like my Chocolate Harvest Pie. 
 This recipe for Butternut Squash Tartines is a combination of several of my favorite fall dishes. I grew up eating my mom's Squash Apple Bake that she would make with acorn squash and sweet, tart apples spiced with cinnamon. For this recipe, I decided to swap out the acorn squash for butternut and the apples for pears to put a different spin on my family's classic.
 The combination of ricotta cheese and the roasted squash was inspired by a fantastic breakfast treat that my mother-in-law taught me. A few years back, she made me the most delicious English muffin that she topped with ricotta cheese and pumpkin butter and then broiled until it was warm and bubbly. I was smitten, and have been making that ever since.
 I wanted to take these two family favorites, mix them up and create the perfect fall appetizer - and I'm pretty sure I did! The sweetness from the maple syrup and pears play off of the rosemary, bubbly ricotta and crunchy hazelnuts in a satisfying combination of flavors and textures. Pair this with a lovely autumn cocktail and you have yourself an instant party! Just don't forget your sweater!

You heat it through, tuck it into a bun, squirt on some mustard, and call it lunch. But there's a big difference between not screwing something up and turning it into a paradigm-shifting, transcendental dining experience. And there are lots of hot dog stands, restaurants, and drive-ins out there that have the power to change your life (Credit: Arthur Bovino).

The perennial grill mate to hamburgers, the hot dog sometimes gets the short end of the stick, charring at the back of the grill while juicy burgers are snatched up as soon as they hit the right temperature. But there's a science, if not an art form, behind constructing the perfect hot-dog-eating experience.
Ultimate Barbecue Sauce Taste Test
That experience was introduced more than 100 years ago, when German immigrants first brought over their frankfurters and started selling them on the cheap at amusement centers like Coney Island, arguably ground zero for American hot dog consumption. Charles Feltman is widely considered to be the first person to have applied hot dog to bun, in order to avoid needing to supply plates and silverware to customers at his sprawling Coney Island restaurant. Employee Nathan Handwerker opened his own hot dog stand a few blocks away in 1916 and sold them for less than Feltman, and became wildly popular (and remains so to this day).
Check out America's Best Pizzas
The hot dog diaspora then began to take on a life of its own, as people began developing their own spice mixes and making their own hot dogs, and every region and group of people soon put its unique stamp on the snack. Greek immigrants in Michigan concocted a cinnamon-rich beef chili that came to be known as Coney sauce, but it has nothing to do with Coney Island, while 'michigans' are big in Upstate New York but have nothing to do with the state. In Chicago they top all-beef dogs with mustard, fresh tomatoes, onions, sport peppers, bright green relish, dill pickles, and celery salt. Spicy Texas Red Hots are popular in New Jersey, but not in Texas, and the uncured, unsmoked White Hot is popular in upstate New York. And the regional variations go on and on.
The 50 Best Cupcakes in America
According to a recent study by GrubHub, the country's most popular hot dog topping is cheese, followed by chili, mustard, onion, and Chicago-style. Ketchup is further down on the list, and, surprisingly, sauerkraut is down towards the bottom. 
On our quest to find America's best hot dogs, we kept an eye out for drive-ins, restaurants, and roadside stands with a definitive style of hot dog and topping, one which embodies not only the region's quirks but the particular tastes and culinary traditions of its people. We judged these hot dogs based on several criteria: the quality of the ingredients (sourcing the franks from well-known regional producers and using fresh-chopped onions, for example), the entire hot dog-eating experience, from driving up to placing your order to taking that first bite, as well as reputation among professional critics and online reviewers.
In order to be included in our list, the vendor needed to have a trademark dog, with toppings that are unique and renowned. For example, Ben's Chili Bowl in Washington, D.C. doesn't just have a trademark frank (the half-smoke), it has a trademark topping (chili), is well-regarded by locals and professional eaters alike, and eating there is a memorable experience unto itself. For those reasons, it's high on our list. 
Sadly, there were some popular favorites that didn't make the cut. While Lafayette Coney Island in Detroit ranks high, its modernized neighbor, American Coney Island, didn't, because it lost much of its charm in the renovation. And while the pretzel dog at chain Auntie Anne's has its loyal devotees, the experience isn't exactly sublime.
Our list runs the gamut from ancient stands that have been serving the same exact product day in and day out for decades to gastropubs putting their unique stamp on the hot dog to a place where people wait in line for more than an hour for one topped with foie gras. There's one constant thread between them, though: they're the country's best.

420,GREEN,The Radioactive Puppies Of Chernobyl Are Finally Getting The Help They Need,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/puppies-chernobyl_us_59c694f9e4b0cdc77331a46f,The dogs are descendants of those left behind after the 1986 nuclear disaster.,2017-09-23,ENVIRONMENT,"A viral video this week sheds light on a heart-rending situation: The radioactive puppies and dogs of Chernobyl.
After the catastrophic 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in what’s now northern Ukraine, many people forced to evacuate the surrounding area left their pets behind, thinking they’d be able to return in a few days. Instead, soldiers were dispatched to shoot the abandoned animals.
But some survived. And hundreds of dogs that now roam the area around Chernobyl are believed to be their descendants.
“Puppies of Chernobyl,” a short documentary uploaded to YouTube by filmmaker Drew Scanlon, shows a series of adorable puppies and dogs in Chernobyl’s exclusion zone — a 1,000-square-mile area around the nuclear plant where access is strictly limited.
Workers at the plant, tourists and some others are allowed in, but only under tight government control. Several hundred people, mostly elderly former residents, also have moved back into their villages over the years, against official orders.
Scanlon says in the video that officials forbade him from petting any of the puppies because of the hazards posed by radioactive particles on their fur. Seeing the little puppies come up to him seeking attention is pretty heartbreaking.
But efforts are underway to get the Chernobyl dogs the care they need.
The Clean Futures Fund — a nonprofit dedicated to helping communities in the aftermath of industrial accidents — is spearheading a five-year plan to spay and neuter the dogs and cats roaming in the area, then set up food and water stations and a veterinary clinic to help care for the animals.
The fund’s plan, which kicked off this summer, involves partnering with Ukrainian veterinarians and other volunteers, as well as organizations in Ukraine, the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany.
The dogs suffer from a lack of food and water, as well as predation from wildlife that has flourished in the area’s relative absence of people, Lucas Hixson, a radiation specialist and Clean Futures Fund co-founder, told HuffPost. While the dogs are surviving long enough to breed — and overpopulate ― it’s extremely rare to see one live to old age.
To avoid radiation exposure, humans are heavily restricted when it comes to where they can go and what they can do within the exclusion zone. But there’s no way to enforce those regulations on free-roaming canines.
“The rules of man mean nothing to the world of dog,” Hixson said. “They lay, they dig, they roll around, they drink puddles.”
The result is dogs with radioactive particles on their fur and inside their bodies — though researchers don’t know exactly how much.
Employees at the plant technically aren’t supposed to interact with the dogs, but many have grown strongly attached to the animals, feeding and playing with them.
“Many of these workers have adopted some of these dogs almost as pets,” Hixson said, though they aren’t permitted to bring the dogs out of the area.
Hixson said there probably aren’t “immediate health hazards” related to radiation from petting the dogs, though he would “definitely suggest washing up afterwards.”
However, the dogs pose another risk — rabies, which they can catch from encounters with local wildlife. Rabies, which is fatal if untreated, is a particularly scary threat in Ukraine, since the country depends on its supply of human rabies treatment from Russia. After years of conflict, supplies are dwindling.
Vaccinating the dogs and shrinking the population via spaying and neutering will reduce the rabies risk, Hixson said.
Clean Futures Fund’s work also involves trying to gauge just how much radiation is present in the dogs’ bodies. The findings could open up the possibility of Ukrainian officials allowing some of the dogs to leave the exclusion zone and ultimately be adopted.
Regardless, Hixson said he hopes his group’s work will improve life for the area’s dogs and safety for the people around then.
“I think there will always be a population of dogs in the area,” he said. “But hopefully, we can get down to a manageable population where they can have a good quality of life.”

I recently had a conversation with some friends about Arianna's new book, Thrive, and the zeitgeist of today. I do agree that Western societies are at an inflection point -- that we are experiencing a collective wake-up call about the deeper meaning of our lives and social purpose of our organizations outside of material success.
A few nights ago, my friend Julien and I had an extraordinary experience that aligns with these conversations that we wanted to share. We came upon a distressing scene on the cascading street steps in front of our little rental house in Mykonos: A woman was weeping and crying out in Italian next to a grey-white stray cat that was sprawled out in a pool of blood struggling to live.
More than a dozen people emerged speaking a cacophony of languages grasping for ways to save the cat. So, we focused on finding a Greek person from the island who could help. 
Just at that moment, a friendly merchant appeared. He explained it was the day of the Ascension and no clinic would be open. But the assembly of neighbors would not yield. After exhausting almost all the options, the merchant called and found one vet willing to open his clinic.
With a local waitress on a motorcycle to guide our jeep, we raced the cat -- that the assembly had bundled in a box -- to the clinic. We meditated and soothed him, encouraging the cat to stay with us. He shot back innocent sparkles from his eyes.
When we arrived, Kostas, the vet, was waiting in his clinic beaming light from atop a hill overlooking the town. Kostas found in the little cat a deep stab wound from a knife still gushing blood. (We have since learned there are adolescent boys who taunt cats in the neighborhood.) With no staff at hand, I assisted the operation for one hour as we stitched the inner muscle and then the pelt of the cat.
The cat survived and we were thrilled. We tucked him into bed at 10 p.m. only to learn the following morning that he may not be able to walk. Julien has named the cat Odysseus, and we are hoping to learn in a few days that he can continue to survive the voyage.
In light of some of the reflections we had been sharing together with some friends a week before this incident, I have been pondering the meaning of it all.
One message is clear: The endgame of cruelty need not prevail; collective human compassion and intelligence can overcome it. Still, it takes an outpouring of kindness to overcome one act of cruelty and it takes believing that the first can trump the second.
No matter the trauma that Odysseus endured, he never exhibited fear of the assembly of neighbors. Just the opposite -- he seemed to believe that it was the first that can prevail in humans.

The shipment was an extraordinary achievement - the start of what would become the first successful organized conservation effort to save a species from extinction. In the ensuing decades the wild bison population would rebound to close to 25,000, with another quarter million maintained as managed herds in every state in the union. So inspiring is the end result that one could be forgiven in forgetting the work required to make it happen.
Two years earlier, in 1905, Bronx Zoo Director William T. Hornaday brought together a group of diverse stakeholders to form the American Bison Society (ABS). With President Theodore Roosevelt as honorary president, ABS set out to prevent the extinction of the American bison by establishing a number of small herds in widely separated parts of the country. 
Anticipating the challenge, Hornaday had already lobbied the Congress to set aside federal land in Oklahoma for the purpose of creating game preserves (as ABS would later do for land in South Dakota and Nebraska). Hornaday now gathered available bison from around the northeast to establish a small population at the Bronx Zoo, operated by NYZS (today the Wildlife Conservation Society, or WCS).

To defray the cost of transporting the animals west, the ABS worked with both Wells Fargo and American Express. The public was also engaged. Between 1908 and 1909, conservation-minded individuals from 29 states - as well as the District of Columbia, England, Canada, and France - made personal contributions, raising more than $10,500 in support of the Montana National Bison herd. 
Hornaday juggled these disparate elements of his campaign expertly. Decades before Rachel Carson's passionate call for the protection of our forests, streams, and pastures in her book Silent Spring, Hornaday helped to establish a veritable blueprint for modern environmental movement-building - one that he would apply again and again to achieve the vision and goals of the zoological society.
As WCS turns 120 this week, it continues that tradition of effective conservation movement building begun a century ago. The past two years have seen perhaps the most ambitious and successful of these efforts with the creation of the 96 Elephants campaign. The campaign takes its name from the roughly 35,000 elephants being killed across Africa each year for their ivory - a figure that translates into 96 elephants per day, or one every 15 minutes. 
 With the slaughter of African elephants reaching 35,000 a year (96 a day), WCS established the 96 Elephants campaign in 2013, joining leaders of elephant range states, NGO partners, and the Clinton Global Initiative (above) in a commitment to stop the killing, stop the trafficking, and stop the demand for elephant ivory.

Responding to the devastating poaching crisis, the 96 Elephants campaign developed a three-prong strategy to curtail the illegal ivory trade: stop the killing, stop the trafficking, and stop the demand. Central to this effort has been an acknowledgement that the United States has itself played a large role in driving demand for ivory. 
With poached ivory being sold and traded as antique (the latter is protected by law, but the two are very difficult to distinguish), a tightening of restrictions on ivory purchases and sales in the United States needed to take place.
To achieve that goal, the 96 Elephants campaign followed Hornaday's tested movement strategy: building coalitions with public and private partners (including more than 120 members of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums), raising public awareness, and working with government leaders. 
 To pursue legislative action to restrict ivory sales in the United States, the 96 Elephants campaign has followed Hornaday's tested movement strategy: building coalitions with public and private partners, raising public awareness, and working with government leaders.

The results would make Hornaday proud. New York and New Jersey successfully established ivory bans in the summer of 2014. Similar efforts are now underway in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and elsewhere.
The success of the 96 Elephants campaign is not merely another example of what's old being new again. It demonstrates that tried and true organizing principles - clearly articulated goals grounded upon public education (including a lot of pavement-pounding), the building of partnerships and alliances, and passionate advocacy at all levels of government - can and should be the basis for other pressing environment and conservation priorities of our time.
In the coming years, WCS hopes to continue to apply this movement strategy for the protection threatened species. In so doing we are not merely working to protect great iconic wildlife like the bison and the elephant. We are developing a constituency for conservation that will continue the fight for future generations as we do now 100 years after William Hornaday's inspiring example.

Now, research shows we might have plants to thank for giving us some much-needed help in slowing the rate of global warming.
Humans have continued to pump increasing amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Since the 1950s, the rate at which carbon dioxide was accumulating in the atmosphere had climbed steadily. It surged from 0.75 parts per million per year in the 1950s to 1.86 ppm per year in 1989. But from 2002 to 2014, the rate stagnated, holding steady at around 1.9 ppm per year. (However, the overall concentration of atmospheric CO2 did rise over this period— just not as quickly as one might’ve expected it to.)
A study published in Nature Communications last month suggests the reason for this is that as CO2 levels have risen, plants have been ramping up photosynthesis and, therefore, absorbing more carbon dioxide than usual.
More photosynthesis has also meant more plants, which have in turn absorbed more CO2 and so on. For several years, this so-called “greening” of the planet is believed to have helped slow the rise of carbon in the atmosphere.
“These results are very exciting,” lead author Trevor Keenan, an ecologist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, told PRI’s Living On Earth podcast in a December interview. “We’ve known for decades that ecosystems have been taking up a lot of the carbon dioxide we emit into the atmosphere. Now, they are not taking up near enough to really stop climate change, but they are slowing it down significantly.”
Without the help of plants, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide would be far higher than it is today, according to Keenan. In September, CO2 levels reached a daily average of above 400 parts per million for the first time in history. We’d already be at 460 ppm if not for the greening effect, a level “we don’t expect until about 2050 or 2060,” Keenan said.
But researchers warn this effect is only temporary and will soon start to wane (if it hasn’t already). 
That’s because though plants take in carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, they also release CO2 through a process called respiration, which is sensitive to temperature increases. 
“So, as CO2 is going up, plants take more CO2 from the atmosphere,” Keenan told PRI. But as global temperatures rise, plants will “also release more CO2.”
“We expect temperatures to continue to increase in the future and they already have over the past two years with the large El Nino event we’ve seen globally, and the net effect of this is a release of carbon dioxide,” Keenan added. “A lot of carbon goes into soils, and these soils are respiring ... [A]s temperature rises, that carbon that has been stored there could be released back into the atmosphere.”
Ultimately, Keenan stressed that though the research offers “good news for now, we can’t expect it to continue,” he told The Washington Post. 
The study should, instead, serve as a reminder of how important it is to protect carbon sinks ― forests, oceans and other natural environments that help absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. Oceans and land plants help remove about 45 percent of the CO2 emitted by humans every year, according to a 2015 study. 
It should also be another wake-up call for people to immediately reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. “The growth of CO2 in the atmosphere continues to grow. And until we really cut our emissions, that’s what’s going to continue to happen,” Keenan told The Verge.
“So plants are helping us out, they’re buying us time, but ultimately it’s up to us.”

Wheeler was not only a key D.C. advocate for the coal industry, but also used to be an aide for everyone’s “favorite” climate-denying senator, James Inhofe.
Wheeler doesn’t believe in climate disruption, which means he’ll be at home in Pruitt’s agency as it moves forward with the plan to try and cast doubt on climate science. As recently exposed in the press, the red team, blue team exercise Pruitt wants to hold to “debate” climate science has been advised by the fossil-fuel-funded staff at the Heartland Institute, a fringe group notorious for its highly controversial tactics to undermine climate action.
Just take that in for a minute - the safety of our drinking water, the air our kids breathe, and even our climate, will be in the hands of a top lobbyist for an industry that has worked relentlessly, for decades, to burn those very protections to the ground. This continues a string of bad and dangerous decisions by Trump and EPA head Scott Pruitt, as they continue to roll back clean air and water standards and let the fossil fuel industry pad its bottom line at the expense of public health. 
From delaying methane pollution protections to attempting to roll back standards that protect our waterways from coal pollution, Trump and Pruitt are clearly forgetting what the “P” in EPA stands for: PROTECTION.
Thankfully, the Sierra Club and allied environmental organizations and activists nationwide are doing everything possible to stop these rollbacks. Even former EPA staff are leading a charge to protect the agency’s mission via a group called “Save EPA.” They’ve created a toolkit called “A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump De-Regulatory Agenda” that’s designed as a guidebook for regular Americans who want to defend EPA and oppose environmental rollbacks - I highly recommend you check it out. They’re empowering people on the ground in cities,towns, and rural communities everywhere to take action on their own to save the EPA from fossil fuel cronies.
As long as Pruitt and Trump try to undermine our public health and environmental standards, moms, dads, doctors, scientists, faith leaders, businesses owners, teachers, and so many others will be there to oppose those dangerous decisions.

427,GREEN,Hospice Veterinarians: Your Pet's Ultimate Relief,"Sarah Hodgson, ContributorBest-Selling Author of 13 books; Associate Applied Behaviorist...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hospice-veterinarians-you_b_5272954.html,,2014-05-09,ENVIRONMENT," (Tischman Pet Photography)
In my previous blog on veterinary hospice care I mentioned my friend and colleague, L.A veterinarian Dr. Jeff Werber, and his experience caring for his terminally ill or aging patients. I was so intrigued by the concept of hospice care for pets, having just gone through human hospice with an aging parent. 
""I think of euthanasia as a gift, when all other cures have been exhausted,"" Jeff shared.  Noting my intrigue, he connected me with Dr. Dani McVety, the co-founder of Lap-of-Love, a network of at-home hospice veterinarians who comfort and care for terminally ill and aging pets. 
What began with a simple hello developed into multiple conversations, illuminating more than a simple description of veterinary hospice care. In Dr. McVety I discovered not just an eager entrepreneur offering compassion and comfort to sick or aging pets but a woman who openly shares her wisdom and kindness Hospice Veterinarians -- a pet messiah who vocalizes the fear and pain a sick pet often feels but cannot voice. 
I've struggled to consolidate our conversations. I outlined hospice care in some detail in my previous post, though it felt like I'd just scratched the surface. I conclude this blog topic with direct quotes from a conversation with Dr. Dani McVety herself. 
Do you have questions for either of us? Please comment below!
Sarah: In today's world I'd think it nearly impossible to find a niche that hasn't already been filled. Veterinarian hospice care -- how did you think of that? When I look at photos of you on your website you look so, so young.
Dr. Dani: I developed my focus as an undergraduate when I volunteered at a human hospice center and created the Lap of Love business with my partner Dr. Mary Gardner in 2009. They didn't teach hospice care then, but I'm teaching it now!
Yes, I'm young, but I'm old enough to know what I want from life: I want to help pets and the people that love them -- this is the route I've chosen to do exactly that. Now, I see my age as a huge asset in my field as both an inspiration to other veterinary students and as a sign of what ""new blood"" can accomplish in this profession of mine.
In 2013, I was privileged to be the youngest recipient of the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine's Distinguished Young Alumni Award, my greatest honor thus far, second only to the thank you cards I receive from families I've helped. 
 (Courtesy of Lap-of-Love)
Sarah: What is the difference between a general care practitioner and veterinary hospice care?
Dr. Dani: Veterinary hospice care providers, as opposed to general practice veterinarian, are not focused on a cure for the disease. We aren't trying to heal your pet, nor do we recommend every possible treatment or cure. 
Hospice veterinarians come into the home, bringing relief to pets at the last stage of their life, insuring the pets are both peaceful and pain free. In addition, we communicate with and support family members who are struggling with the process. We focus on the quality of life, rather than treatments that may (or may not) prolong the inevitable. Even when we assist death through euthanasia, we treat the choice as a gift, not as a ""failure"" of our medical options. 
Death is sometimes viewed as the enemy of the living. While it's great modern medicine offers many options to treat different conditions, we have to remember that not everyone can or chooses to afford these procedures, and that diagnosis, procedures and medicines are not always as affective as we intend them to be.
Sarah:  I think I hear what you're saying. Lap of Love Veterinary Hospice care doesn't argue or judge why a person may choose to let their pet go, they simply comfort the pet during their last stage of life. And they comfort the people too, so they feel less guilty about their decision.
What is the number one message you'd give to someone considering these delicate, end-of-life decisions?
Dr. Dani: Treating the disease is not always the same as treating the patient! Hospice veterinarians support the belief that at some point you have to accept that the patient is more important than the illness. While supporting a pet's immune system is warranted, and surgery can offer relief for internal imbalances, as pets age or risk a sufferable condition, there comes a point where a procedure may be more stressful or life-limiting than the ailment itself.
My favorite quote -- from Jurassic Park, funnily enough -- is, ""Just because we can doesn't mean that we should."" So, it translates for me too -- Just because you might be able to try another remedy or procedure, doesn't mean that you should do it. 
Sarah: Changing the subject for a moment, I heard that 80% of veterinary school graduates are woman these days. That's astounding. Does it help being a female in a position that requires immeasurable, consistent, and unwavering empathy?   Dr. Dani: Absolutely! Some of our clients will actually refuse to see a male doctor, I've never heard of someone refusing a female doctor. Lap of Love has over 90% female doctors at this time. 
Sarah: Okay. So tell me how it works. What does a hospice veterinarian do all day?
Dr. Dani: As a veterinary hospice practitioner we go into our patient's homes, treating a pet where they feel most safe. We spend a lot of time talking to families about their options. Together we balance the disease process, the family's wishes, and the pet's personality; these are three separate and very distinct areas. It's our job to find where they overlap. 
For instance, let's look at bone cancer. It has the potential to go from ""okay"" to ""very bad"" in a split second if the bone weakens enough to break. We present all possible realities and then work to determine what the families wish for their pet. Many want to hang on until the last minute, which can spell out discomfort for the pet; in that case, we administer drugs to comfort the pet and alleviate pain. We always emphasize that medications are only so effective, and when the suffering becomes unbearable, we let the family know that too. 
Pets are all different. Some have higher pain thresholds and can endure discomfort; others go out of their mind and may become aggressive as they try to cope with their agony. These differences are very important to consider when we are deciding how best to treat a pet and when to mitigate suffering completely via euthanasia.   Sarah: I feel we can't talk about veterinary options without talking costs. I know many clients complain they are talked into procedures before they know the extent of the cost/cure value. One of my clients was irate when she learned that a surgery only had a 30 percent shot of curing her pet's condition, and the procedure had cost over $10,000! She felt she had been guilted into a procedure by her veterinarian who had not informed her of the cost or the prognosis. Her pet lived another 6 months, but two months were spent in recovery, and the rest, forcing pills down her throat. It left my client sad, angry and resentful.
Dr. Dani: In veterinary school, I started to truly understand the limitations of my medical education and the importance of communication. Veterinary medicine is not funded by Medicare or Medicaid, and pet insurance, although wonderful, has its limitations as well. 
As veterinarians, we need to demonstrate the value of what the client is about to pay for (i.e., diagnostics tests, medications, or therapies they may not fully understand) by conveying our deep love and commitment to making the pet feel better. 
I started to realize as a student that when we do not convey that commitment fully, the clients do not feel supported or heard and may feel judged. Clients that feel judged do not share their thoughts with their doctor and risk draining one of their 4 budgets: time, emotion, physical, or financial. When one of these budgets is drained, the human-animal bond is at risk of being broken. 
Veterinarians do not sell medicine -- the vaccines, surgeries, medications... that's not our product. The human-animal bond is our product. Without that bond, our profession will cease to exist as we know it. 
Sarah: You have so much wisdom. I think I've told you my favorite ""pearl."" Can I hear it one more time?
Dr. Dani: Sure! Death isn't the opposite of life. It's the opposite of birth! No one should ever suffer pain -- there are so many options to comfort a pet nearing the end of their time on earth. Lap of Love's veterinary hospice care gifts us the time leading up to death to comfort our pets as we prepare ourselves for final goodbyes.

The findings of the National Intelligence Council, released on Sept. 21, included the following: “Fueled by unusually warm Arabian Sea waters, two separate tropical cyclones hit Yemen in 2015 in the span of just 10 days, including the first hurricane-strength storm to hit the country in recorded history.” The memo continued,
Already suffering a humanitarian crisis from war and water shortages, Yemen was unable to provide adequate relief for its citizenry. Heavy rains have since fueled the breeding of an unusually large population of desert locusts that threaten to devastate Yemen’s agriculture, and efforts to eradicate the locusts have been stymied both by the difficult security situation and by fear of killing bees, a crucial pollinator for the region’s honey and crop production.
Currently, Yemenis think “the United States has been waging an extended campaign in the country, the hidden hand behind Saudi Arabia’s punishing air war,” the New York Times reported on Oct. 14. “A year and a half of bombing — along with the deaths of thousands of Yemeni civilians — has stoked anger in Yemen not only toward the Saudis, but also toward their perceived patrons in Washington.”
A report from Vice on Oct. 12 stated that in Yemen the “bombardment continues, enduring ongoing criticism for what NGOs and aid groups say is a disregard for civilian deaths that equates to indiscriminate warfare.” That “air war is being waged with American support.” Even without the war, the country is suffering from a lack of water, according to a World Bank bulletin from 2014: “Yemen today is a glimpse of what’s in store for other parts of the Middle East and North Africa ... as climate change and rapid population growth combine to put more and more pressure on the resources essential to human life.”
The US intelligence memo released two weeks ago added that “climate-induced environmental stresses... are likely to contribute to migrations that exacerbate social and political tensions, some of which could overwhelm host governments and populations.” In a nutshell, “climate-change related disruptions are well underway.” In a J.P. Morgan Chase report released on Sept. 27, titled “US Election Equity Guide,” one of the central issues “with market impact that are at stake this election season” includes energy, of which the first bullet point identifies “clean power and climate change” as critical.
It does not seem to be widely commented on, but solar and wind power installations in the US grew “by almost 70 percent in the last five years even as investment flat lined,” according to an article in Bloomberg New Energy Finance published a few days ago, which adds that the cost of wind power alone has dropped by 50 percent in the last seven years. Much more needs to be done, particularly to start removing carbon from the atmosphere. A recent report by Oil Change International produced the below projection showing a 50 percent chance of keeping the global temperature increase under 1.5 degrees.
More immediately, the JPMorgan report states that “Clinton would likely target greenhouse gas emission cuts, favor of expanding solar/wind tax credits and grants, and continue Obama administration green energy initiatives such as the Clean Power Plan,” whereas her opponent “will aim for a more energy friendly policy and has stated numerous times that his focus would be to achieve energy independence.” The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, spoke on the subject earlier this month, saying “we can and should all help to find renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions that allow them to phase out coal.” One week before, on Oct. 2, the third-largest carbon emitter, India, ratified the climate accord struck in Paris ten months ago. Meanwhile, what is arguably the issue of all issues has received scant attention in this year’s electoral imbroglio.
Looking toward the next two decades, it remains to be seen whether that approach will mean more torment for suffering countries — and discomfort for the affluent countries.

429,GREEN,Fate Of Cargo Ship Unknown As Hurricane Joaquin Batters Bahamas,"Neil Hartnell, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fate-of-cargo-ship-unknown-as-hurricane-joaquin-batters-bahamas_us_560ff0d5e4b0dd85030c4438,The fate of more than 30 crew aboard a cargo ship missing off the Bahamas in heavy seas whipped up by Hurricane Joaquin was,2015-10-03,ENVIRONMENT,"The fate of more than 30 crew aboard a cargo ship missing off the Bahamas in heavy seas whipped up by Hurricane Joaquin was unknown on Friday as the storm battered the island chain for a second day.
News the vessel had lost contact with shore came as forecasters shifted the likely track of the potentially catastrophic storm further away from the U.S. East Coast, but there were still warnings about the possibility of severe flooding in the Carolinas from unrelated heavy rains.
Late Friday afternoon, the U.S. National Hurricane Center downgraded Joaquin, the third hurricane of the 2015 Atlantic season, to a Category 3 hurricane on a scale of 1 to 5, down from its previous Category 4 ranking.
By Friday evening, Joaquin's core was beginning to move away from the central Bahamas, the Miami-based center said in an 8 p.m. EDT advisory, adding that hurricane conditions would continue for several more hours.
The storm, packing maximum sustained winds of 125 miles per hour (205 km per hour), was about 25 miles (40 km) north-northeast of San Salvador in the Bahamas and moving northeast at 7 mph (11 kph), the NHC said. The storm's movement was expected to gradually pick up speed in the next 48 hours.
The U.S. Coast Guard said search and rescue crews were hunting for the 735-foot (224 m) El Faro and its 33 crew members after it was overcome by heavy weather from Joaquin off Crooked Island in the Bahamas on Thursday morning.
The ship, with 28 U.S. citizens and five Polish nationals aboard, was headed to San Juan, Puerto Rico, from Jacksonville, Florida, when it reported it had lost propulsion and was listing and taking on water, the Coast Guard said.
The Coast Guard said there had been no further communications after the vessel issued the emergency call at about 7:30 a.m. Thursday.
The El Faro was in the eye of Joaquin about 35 miles (56 km)north of Crooked Island when it issued the distress call, according to Chief Ryan Doss with the Coast Guard in Miami.
""We have had 20-foot seas reported so it's going to take a while to get into the area,"" Doss said.
A Coast Guard cutter headed to help after taking part in a separate rescue mission off Haiti, while two Air Force Hurricane Hunter planes searched in vain for the U.S.-owned El Faro.
""The low cloud cover makes satellite communications difficult,"" Doss said, while the winds and high seas made it hard to get close enough by sea or air.
""The storm is so bad and slow moving it's hard for our planes to get low enough to inspect the surface of the water.""
Mike Hanson, a spokesman for the owner of the ship, Tote Maritime Puerto Rico, told Reuters all contact with the vessel had been lost since Thursday morning, which he said was “very unusual,” especially as the ship was equipped with a marine transponder, a satellite phone and GPS locators on the containers. “We checked them all,” he said.
The El Faro, built in 1975, recently underwent a complete updating, Hanson said.
Captain Stephen Russell, director of the Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency, said earlier there were no reports of deaths or injuries in the Bahamas from Joaquin.
He cited reports of extensive flooding and structural damage on at least two smaller islands in the archipelago, but apart from some roofs ripped off houses, damage seemed to be limited.
The storm dumped torrential rain over parts of the Bahamas but its hurricane-force winds missed the larger islands and the main cities and cruise ship ports of Freeport and Nassau.
An easterly shift in the forecast track of the slow-moving system meant it was expected to pass well off the U.S. eastern seaboard, according to the NHC.
But accumulated rainfall in the Carolinas from unrelated storms this week coupled with more on the way from Joaquin prompted a warning from the National Weather Service on Friday about a “historic, potentially life-threatening rainfall event” in parts of the Carolinas and northeast Georgia this weekend.
Up to 12 inches (30.5 cm) of rain were expected in some areas between Friday and Sunday, with flash floods and gusts up to 35 miles per hour (56 kph) likely to topple trees and cause power outages, the Weather Service said. Flood warnings and coastal flood advisories were in effect for some sections.
“Our state is now likely to miss any direct impact from the hurricane, but there’s still significant danger of flooding, high seas, heavy surf, beach erosion and overwash,” North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory told a news conference on Friday.
Two deaths in the Carolinas on Thursday were linked to heavy rainfall.
Earlier this week, the governors of New Jersey, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Maryland declared states of emergency and announced measures including mobilization of National Guard troops in preparation for the storm.
Before the first easterly shift in Joaquin’s trajectory, New York and New Jersey - where Superstorm Sandy killed more than 120 people and caused $70 billion of property damage in October 2012 - both faced potential threats from the storm.

The Blue Cut fire, named for a narrow gorge near its origin in the Cajon Pass about 75 miles northeast of Los Angeles, has blackened 35,969 acres of drought-parched heavy brush and chaparral after breaking out on Tuesday.
Officials said firefighters were able to carve containment lines around 22 percent of the blaze as of Thursday night ― up from just four percent earlier in the day ― despite dry, hot and windy weather conditions and treacherous terrain.
But the intensely burning blaze, producing cyclone-like whirls of flame, continued to threaten some 34,500 homes and other structures in communities including the ski resort town of Wrightwood, fire officials said.
While many residents opted to stay put for the time being, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Office said deputies arrested three people suspected of attempting to loot from the abandoned homes of evacuees.
Transit authorities on Thursday reopened Interstate 15, the primary traffic route between greater Los Angeles and Las Vegas, Nevada, after it was closed for two days by the fast-moving blaze.
The Blue Cut fire is one of nearly 30 major blazes reported to have scorched some 530 square miles in eight Western states this week, in the midst of a wildfire season stoked by prolonged drought and unusually hot weather, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.

431,GREEN,Taoism Is Environmentalism,"Arthur Rosenfeld, ContributorTaoist monk, author, speaker",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/taoism-is-environmentalis_b_6208594.html,,2014-11-23,ENVIRONMENT,"Recently, I penned a review of the movie Interstellar, a science fiction blockbuster that chronicles a plan to find a new place for mankind to live after the Earth is rendered uninhabitable by destructive human activities. The very personal point of the post was that I would have preferred to see such wonderful special effects and directorial wizardry applied to the a solution for the problems on this planet rather than glorifying a high-tech escape to a new one. As a Taoist with an abiding respect for nature, a love of harmony and balance, I find the creative opportunities inherent in living a life of compassion, frugality, and humility (Taoism's Three Treasures) more engaging than the notion of exporting our destructive, species-centric culture to yet another floating rock. 
Because environmental awareness and Taoism go hand in hand, I frequently conflate destruction of our environment with trends in the way we express ourselves spiritually, or fail to do so. These trends include a culture of consumption, a growing sense of entitlement, an exaggerated notion of our own importance, valuing the pleasures of the individual above the good of the community, and the belief (advanced by all Abrahamic religions) that our species enjoys holy dispensation to do with the world as it wishes.
Of all the ideas advanced in the manifesto on my Taoist site, www.spiritualswat.org it is my challenge to this last precept that generates the most energetic response. As a monk, I understand why. We deeply love such heroes as Moses, Jesus, Zoroaster, Mani, Buddha, Mohammed, and Lao Tzu, whether they ever really lived or not. We are also deeply attached to their stories, which typically begin with a mystical experience (a burning bush, an amphibious crossing, a wrestling match with a devil), continue to a spiritual awakening, and finish with an exhortation to followers to treat all sentient beings with compassion and respect. Yet while I know that the human brain is organically wired for stories, I worry when we value plot over message in a way that would surely disturb their mythical protagonists.
I recognize that living according to the Three Treasures, treating each other with respect and compassion, and cherishing all living things as cradles of cosmic consciousness sounds naively utopian. Even so, I agree with the famous critic, Irving Howe, who is reported to have quipped ""utopianism is a necessity of the moral imagination."" If this Taoist utopia seems overly simplistic, I'm okay with that. Simplicity, it turns out, seems to be an important component of spiritual growth in every tradition.
The term spirituality has become an object of derision among some scientists, material pragmatists, nihilists, and even religious traditionalists. Perhaps some of this ridicule is warranted, given that these days, at least in our country, the word can be associated with shallow narcissism, the sales of yoga mats, the wearing of silver amulets, the slurping of energy drinks, and chanting in dead languages. I submit that we ought emphasize not the commercial aspects of the term but rather the connection between what we believe and how we behave. 
Spirituality can be as real, concrete, and legitimate as our ability with numbers, language, and the manipulation of our physical world. It can be about the Golden Rule: about treating other sentient beings with the same care and respect that we would have them treat us. It can be about kindness rather than violence in our large-scale actions towards the environment and each other. It can be about changing our priorities, coming to terms with our impulses and drives, and making better choices. It can be about turning off the tap rather than letting it run, about giving a hungry person something to eat, and about aiding an injured animal. Spirituality can be about not taking two when one will do, and about eschewing meat in favor of a plant-based diet. It can be about rejecting tyranny, or any other injury perpetrated by the strong upon the weak. It can mean switching off the TV when nobody is in the room. It simply must be about turning our ideals into actions so as to manifest the maximum possible good in the world.
In my own life, I cleave to Taoism precisely because it makes clear how to do just that. Unlike many other religions, Taoism requires no belief in the supernatural, though it does tend to view all of nature as super. It offers a peaceful, practical recipe for living seems that seems right at a time when religion must evolve to emphasize framework over faith, and to provide a coherent, broadly accessible, non-exclusive community inside of which we can all work together to find solutions for Earth's problems.
In the same way that environmental forces once selected for our opposable thumbs, upright posture, and the development of language and tools, they are now pushing us not to flee the planet, but to evolve a totally new worldview and value set like the one Taoists discovered millennia ago. We can either embrace such a system or extinguish ourselves--and much of the other life on Earth--in a furious orgy of hate and pain. If your set of myths and stories offers good practical solutions to the world problems, then sing them and live them. If your beliefs have been lost to greed, politics, literalism, or dilution, may I humbly ask you to reconsider them? Until such time as we take a great leap forward in consciousness, we must at least embrace stories that serve the entire living planet, not merely ourselves.

Greetings! It is a great honor to be given the opportunity to represent Denver Public Schools and Climate Generation: A Will Steger Legacy at the UNFCC COP21 Negotiations in Paris, France. Upon arrival, it was apparent that the city has rolled out the ""green carpet,"" as COP21 occupied high visibility in all parts of the city.
I am attending these historic events as a passionate science educator and concerned citizen who is committed to playing a role in addressing our world's climate crisis. Students in my classroom at Compassion Road Academy in Denver have been preparing to participate virtually in these historic negotiations for months, and I cannot wait to share this experience with them as well as with you.
This is my first-ever blog post, and I am excited that you have taken the time to read through my thoughts and experiences. As I write I am enjoying the accommodations at the Generator Hostel after a very long day of traveling, meeting new people and taking in the beauty of the city. I've been reflecting upon all that has lead to this point in time, in addition to thinking through the magnitude of the decisions that will be made by our world leaders gathered in Paris with me.
During my travels, I found myself questioning all of the choices that we are faced with everyday, which have an impact on our global health. It is challenging to be a 21st century citizen, as we are constantly faced with decisions that directly or indirectly impact our world. Ultimately, this is the goal that I have everyday: as soon as I step into my classroom, I strive to help my students think through the choices they make and consider other ways to live their lives that ultimately have a softer impact on our fragile environment.
World leaders at COP21 are tasked with one of the greatest challenges that our world has ever seen. I desperately want to believe that our political leaders and scientists can come to an agreement that will drastically reduce the amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gases that are being released into the atmosphere and are increasing the global average surface temperature.
The time is now -- action must be taken. We can no longer turn our heads away from science. The evidence is clear -- human activity is causing the climate to change on a time scale that has never before been seen. As much as I would like to say that I am optimistic that action will be taken and that our leaders will implement sweeping reforms, I am worried, for multiple reasons.
I believe that our leaders are going to continue to walk the line on climate change, and that true change is going to come only when all the world's communities join together to demand that more serious actions are taken. We are more powerful together, and it is my hope that the UNFCC COP21 negotiations serve as a catalyst to unite our communities in order to demand that the necessary climate actions are taken. But even if the actions that are needed are not taken right now, each step that we take brings us closer to achieving the low-carbon future that we need. We can only hope that we don't set the appropriately ambitious goals once it has become too late.
Sending all of my positive energy and love for a strong agreement at COP21!
Minneapolis-based nonprofit, Climate Generation: A Will Steger Legacy, is leading a delegation of 10 Education Ambassadors to COP21 through their Window Into Paris program, December 5-11. These 10 teachers - representing diverse subject areas, grade levels, and school communities from Denver, Atlanta, upstate New York, western North Carolina and Minnesota - are connecting their students to climate policy in action, helping to build both climate literacy and the relevance of this issue in their students' lives.

It was early April, and after class at the University of California, Santa Barbara, the student and model grabbed her longboard, which is painted to look like a watermelon, and headed to the stretch of beach behind campus. 
It's pretty common for Schechter to see a variety of animals while surfing there -- like dolphins, which ""get so close to the surfers that they brush beneath our feet,"" she says. ""When the water is clear, I can see beautiful fish, rays, and sharks -- usually the kind that don't bite. One of the most breathtaking sights is to watch migrating whales pass through, but usually they're pretty far out to sea."" 
It's not even that odd to see seals and sea lions. ""But it is rare for them to hop up on boards!"" says Schechter.

This one didn't just hop up. The pup, which may have been abandoned by its mother and was in need of care, snuggled up close.
""I knew she must have been unwell, because she was quite a young pup to be away from her mother, but she didn’t seem injured or sick! I coaxed her back into the water but she hopped right back onto my board, cuddling and nuzzling up to me, as if I was her mother,"" Schechter wrote in a blog post for Swell.com about the encounter. ""A young boy and his father saw me, and paddled out. They too were excited, and the boy even asked me, 'are you a mermaid?!' They were also kind enough to use my camera to take a picture of me with the pup (my selfie attempts weren’t working out so well)! When the young boy paddled up to my board, approaching the pup, she growled at him, and waddled over to me for safety. The boy and his father went in to look for help, but no one of authority was around!""

After a couple hours, Schechter contacted Paul Stark, a sea lion authority with the Santa Barbara Marine Mammal Center, who was able to come by and collect the pup. Schechter was, by then, calling the little grey animal Winifred the Pinniped.
Stark brought Winifred in for a month's worth of rehabilitation, before releasing Winifred back into the ocean. He tells The Huffington Post that it's actually fairly common for sea lions to ""hang out on anything that floats,"" especially if they are young, abandoned by their mothers and malnourished like Winifred was. 
This year, animal care experts along the Pacific Ocean in California have seen a spike in the number of ailing seals and sea lion pups, and they're not completely sure what the cause is. Stark says his group has rescued almost 300 marine mammals so far this year. 
Several weeks after meeting Winifred, Schechter herself even helped save another sea lion. 
""I was going for a run on the beach before class. I came across another tiny sea lion sitting on some rocks,"" she says. ""I saw that this pup was even thinner than Winifred, so I figured it was in the same situation, abandoned and starving. I called up the marine mammal center once again and actually got to assist in helping to load the pup into the truck!""
Stark cautions that it's important not to be seduced into thinking that anyone could just move to California and take up surfing, with the dream of finding a personal sea lion buddy. The adorable-looking animals can be ""bitey and dangerous,"" he says, adding that Schechter was ""lucky she wasn't bitten.""
Schechter does indeed feel lucky. 
""I have always been a huge animal lover, so being able to form a special connection with an amazing marine mammal really touched me,"" she says. ""Being able to help a sea animal in need allowed me to give back to the place I love the most: the ocean. This was absolutely the most incredible and special event that I have ever experienced.""

""Congratulations to all involved in the rescue of the juvenile humpback whale,"" Sea World Gold Coast said in a Facebook post Thursday. ""Everyone did an amazing job and we are so proud of everyone's tireless efforts.""
The organization said that the whale calf -- said to weigh nearly 20 tons -- was ""in a fair condition when released and the rescue team are cautiously optimistic the whale will survive."" 
As Australia's Yahoo 7 News notes, the rescue team had to ""race against time"" to rescue the stranded whale, employing ""delicate and dangerous"" methods to free the animal. 
Earlier:
Marine rescue workers in Australia have been working tirelessly for two days to free a juvenile humpback whale that's been stranded at Queensland's Palm Beach. 
The 30-foot whale calf beached itself on Tuesday evening, the Brisbane Times reports. Since then, rescue workers have been trying to get it to deeper waters. Though some progress has been made, the animal remained stranded as of early Thursday morning local time. 
Fortunately, the whale has been described as being in ""good condition"" despite the trauma, per News.com.au. 
According to a Facebook post by Sea World Gold Coast, rescue workers ""monitored the whale overnight and continue to be onsite.""
The post added that rescuers are planning to conduct ""an additional rescue attempt"" Thursday morning.

It's More Than Just The Fare,"Jena Thompson Meredith, ContributorVice President of Business Partnerships, The Conservation Fund",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/serving-local-and-organic-for-the-holidays-its-more_us_5851dd21e4b0bae8bdcba297,"As millions of Americans take a much-deserved pause to join family and friends during this holiday season, it goes without",2016-12-19,ENVIRONMENT,"As millions of Americans take a much-deserved pause to join family and friends during this holiday season, it goes without saying that our tables will feature traditional homemade recipes passed down through generations. From turkey and ham to vegetarian and vegan dishes, many of us will enjoy sustainably grown and responsibly harvested food from local farms and ranches across the country. By all accounts, “farm to table” is front and center this holiday season.
The local food sector is valued at $12 billion and is growing 9 percent a year. However, our farmers are getting older, and we’re losing family farms to development. Sales of organic products saw double digit growth last year to $43 billion. That’s five percent of all food sales. However, only 1 percent of our land base is certified organic. And it may be too costly for farmers to increase that land base significantly. If we’re to be successful, we need to focus on a system-wide approach that includes land conservation, the farmers and ranchers, and markets. And if we want to really move the needle, we’re going to need leadership from business—and all of us as customers—to help drive change. We need to help address the lack of supply at scale.
Unfortunately, many of our working lands are at risk; small and mid-sized farms are disappearing fast. In the next five years, more than 90 million acres of farmland will be sold because of changing demographics. That’s 10 percent of U.S. farmland up for sale—twice the size of the state of Missouri. Who will buy these farms? Who will grow our food?
Consider the following: A 2015 study by the Farmland Information Center showed that states invested $105 million in one year to protect farm and ranch land but spent $108 billion—about 1,000 times more—on highways. 
In order to protect the farmer, we’ve learned you need to protect the land. And often, that also requires investing in entrepreneurs who can grow the market to keep up with rising demand.
For example, since 1993, The Conservation Fund has provided more than $22 million in bridge financing to local land trusts to conserve 100 family farms. In New England, that equates to 10,000 acres of permanently protected farmland across the Connecticut River Valley. These lands provide fresh fruits and vegetables to Boston Public Market, a 28,000-square foot permanent, year-round indoor market providing only locally-sourced food to the public, the first of its kind in the country. 
On the West Coast, Lundberg Family Farms is a third generation family farm whose motto is simple: “leave the land better than you found it.” 
In the 1930’s Albert Lundberg witnessed the Dustbowl that resulted from poor soil management and short-sighted farming techniques. After moving the family to Northern California’s fertile Sacramento Valley, he impressed upon his four sons the need to care for the soil.
Today, Lundberg Family Farm’s Certified Organic and Eco-Farmed rice is grown with a concern for the environment. In addition to operating a sustainable farm, the company is keenly aware of the connection between working lands, sustainability and its customers.
It’s a recognition that sustainability and common sense need to go hand in hand.
The same thinking must be applied to seafood production. By 2050 we will need to double the global food supply to feed the world’s population. In the U.S., much of our seafood is a far cry from local; more than 90 percent is imported. We need access to high-quality, healthy and locally-sourced seafood so we can provide for our families and put less pressure on our oceans. 
To meet this challenge, The Freshwater Institute is pioneering technology, research and development to redefine fish farming—on land—to provide fresh, locally grown fish. It has developed a sustainable system and fish feed that does not use wild-caught fish meal. Fish are not treated with antibiotics or hormones, and the technology can be used anywhere. 
When it comes to the rise of local and organic food, we can choose to make a change for good. We need to preserve the land that food is grown on, support the farmers and businesses that grow, process, and distribute our food, and strengthen the markets that serve local communities across the country. As we reflect with family and friends during this holiday season, let’s continue to build on this progress so that future generations can enjoy even better access to local, healthy food than we do today.

First, chickens made the news around the world as orthodox Jewish communities practiced the ritual of Kapparot -- a Yom Kippur tradition of swinging a live chicken over ""the sinner's"" head and then slaughtering it. Chicken brutality in Fresno, California also made headlines, when close to 1,000 chickens were bludgeoned to death by four teenagers who broke into a farm. 
""What a bad week to be a chicken,"" you might have thought. 
Friends, it is always a bad week to be a chicken. 
It is human nature to reel against heinous and purposeful cruelty. For instance, the story of a Brooklyn man who kicked a cat while being filmed recently went viral, as did the infamous Michael Vick dog fighting scandal. We Americans have little tolerance for deliberate cruelty, so the media attention received by the bludgeoned chickens is not surprising. But the elephant in the room in this story is this: our eating habits support cruelty that is every bit as savage and barbaric as bludgeoning animals with golf clubs.
One could certainly make an argument that those clubbed chickens met a fate no crueler than the one they were bound to face. Every year, 9 billion chickens suffer horrendously on factory farms so that we can eat them. ""Broilers"" are bred to grow so large and so fast that they can barely stand or move around -- doing so causes tremendous pain. During their short, painful lives, these birds live in cramped warehouses and never see daylight. At the end of their 47-day life, they are sent to the slaughterhouse where, among other horrors, millions are boiled alive every year as they miss the neck slicer and are submerged, completely conscious, into a water bath meant to remove their feathers. Sounds just as painful as being clubbed to death to me. 
  Consider this:
300 million hens in the U.S. are kept in ""battery cages,"" tiny cages shared with up to 11 birds in which each bird gets less room than a standard 8.5x11 inch sheet of paper. Their beaks are seared off with a hot blade, without anesthetic, so that they cannot peck at each other in the confined space. 
In the U.S. alone, over 8 million ""dairy cows"" live on factory farms. Dairy cows' tails and horns are cut off without anesthesia. Female cows also often suffer from a painful condition called mastitis, an infection that causes cows' udders to swell. On top of it all, cows are kept in a constant cycle of impregnation and birth in order to make milk, and suffer the emotional toll of losing their babies -- male calves become veal and females become dairy cows -- just moments after birth. 
These are just two examples of the cruelty inflicted by our food choices. As we judge those who inflict intentional harm, I urge us to turn our judgement inward, too--to face the truth that that each of us, through the simple practice of eating, supports infinitely greater harm to an infinitely greater number of non-human animals than all of the animal cruelty stories that made their way into the news last week.
In just a few days, Catskill Animal Sanctuary will host its 13th Annual Shindig -- a celebration of compassionate living. At Shindig, you can see farmed animals thriving as all animals should. At Shindig, you can taste delicious vegan food. At Shindig, the solution to farmed animal cruelty is clear: we must go vegan. 
I believe we humans are compassionate. Many of us still don't know the harm we are causing. Take the first step towards compassionate living and visit CASanctuary.org to learn more about transitioning to a vegan diet. Better yet, if you're in the area, come to this year's Shindig, visit us any weekend May-November for a tour, or stay at our beautiful Homestead, now open year round! 
Whether an animal meets his end with the blow of a club or the slice of blade, causing death is a cruel act. Chose compassion instead today.

While Japan is recovering from former Typhoon Phanfone, Super Typhoon Vongfong will turn northward across the Western Pacific Ocean and bring a new threat by the end of the week.
Vongfong brought flooding rainfall and damaging wind to the northern Mariana Islands on Sunday, local time. Wind gusts over 89 kph (55 mph) and rainfall over 75 millimeters (3 inches) were common.
It is now equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 270 kph (166 mph).
""Vongfong is the strongest tropical cyclone we've had all year anywhere on Earth,"" AccuWeather.com Meteorologist Jim Andrews said.
The strength of Vongfong has surpassed that of Super Typhoon Genevieve which, at its most powerful, had sustained winds of 257 kph (160 mph) in the West Pacific.
The combination of light wind shear and warm water allowed Vongfong to rapidly strengthen across the western Pacific Ocean so far this week.
Late in the week, while Vongfong is located south of Japan, the typhoon is expected to slow down and make a turn to the north. While there remains some uncertainty in the exact track of the storm, confidence is high that the powerful cyclone will track north toward Japan with the potential for a landfall in mainland Japan by early next week.
""Destructive winds and flooding rain will be the top threats,"" Andrews said.
The first target will be the northern Ryukyu Islands which could begin to feel impacts from Vongfong as early as Saturday or Saturday night.
""It's not out of the question that the storm gets hooked westward, making direct landfall on one or more of the northern or central Ryukyu islands late Saturday into Sunday, local time,"" Andrews said. ""That would mean typhoon-force winds and flooding rain.""
 This animated GIF shows Vongfong tracking across the western Pacific Ocean. (NOAA/Satellite)
The worst impacts across mainland Japan are expected from Monday into Tuesday, with typhoon-force winds and inundating rainfall expected.
""How far west Vongfong is able to run will also determine whether there is a direct landfall in the island of Kyushu and thus the exact impact in cities such as Kagoshima,"" Andrews said.
Many areas at risk from Vongfong are still recovering from more than 150 millimeters (6 inches) of rain and strong winds that hammered eastern Japan from Sunday into Monday as Typhoon Phanfone moved through the region.
Tokyo was deluged by 272 millimeters (10.71 inches) of rain ahead of and during the height of Phanfone.
""Phanfone was a huge rainstorm for Tokyo, one of the biggest I can remember,"" Andrews added, noting moisture from the storm interacted with stalled front, prolonging the duration of rain.
There could be several inches of rain in Tokyo, almost exactly one week after Phanfone's impact.
""The threats are the same as they were with Phanfone,"" Andrews said. ""There are some likenesses but also some differences in Phanfone's track. The results can vary markedly with small differences in track and storm speed.""
All interests in Japan should continue to monitor this powerful typhoon.

The latter choice is all too rare an opportunity to miss. 
The recent March of official representatives of many different countries (People's Climate March) on climate change through New York, for the United Nations General Assembly, shining in the media spotlight, provided an ideal opportunity.
Simply put, although it appeared to cause enthusiasm from those who saw here a willingness on the part of these leaders to finally take care of this serious matter, it triggered a wild laughter in me, followed by great indignation.
Indeed how can one refrain from laughing seeing those who are supposed to rule the world, recognize inadvertently their powerlessness, glowingly pleased with themselves as they march with other protesters? It is like the CEO of a company marching with his employees in order to improve their working conditions! A burst of laughter in particular when seeing the Secretary General of the United Nations walk dressed as a protester, and Ministers clearly quite happy to be there, without realizing the ridiculousness of such a posture. 
Fuming also after seeing them admit that they are increasingly less influential in the destiny of the world and on the lookout for the slightest available opportunity to show their satisfied faces on television screens, even at the cost of bringing their function into disrepute. Fuming again after seeing that there was no real serious debate at the United Nations on major issues having to do with the challenges of climate change, and that the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointedly recalled, this very week, on behalf of all the emerging countries: « Do not ask us to forgo growth for your comfort; do not ask us to remain in poverty for you to continue to pollute. »
Of course, after the March, no useful conclusions were reached during the meeting of the United Nations. And at this pace of political unpreparedness and media hype, it will be the same, after so many others, for the Paris conference in December 2015.
All serious diplomats know this: No serious agreement can be reached on any subject when there are more than ten people around the table and when negotiations are public, prohibiting any compromise. However, the Paris conference will bring together nearly 200 countries and 40,000 NGO and government representatives! Therefore, it can only lead to a fiasco camouflaged at best into a semblance of agreement of emissions reduction to 30 percent by 2050; an agreement all the more audacious given that today's Ministers will certainly not be there to realize, when the time comes, their demagoguery.
It is essential, therefore, to understand that it is not one more international conference that will resolve these issues; but an initiative by individual countries, in order to reconcile the strengthening of democracy, GDP growth, poverty reduction and controlling greenhouse gas emissions.
This requires a credible answer to four questions: 1. What revolutionary technologies can help there? 2. What forces have an interest in doing everything they can to make this impossible and how to prevent them from causing damage? 3. What changes of mentality can assist there?  4. More generally, how can we ensure that our democratic societies will support the interests of future generations?
To answer these questions, what is required is to cease walking and looking for an opportunity to shine under the spotlight, in order to reflect and act.

And, with those words, Donald Trump turned his back on humanity, and pulled the US out of the Paris climate pact, callously condemning future generations on earth to a life of sweltering purgatory.
Ignoring the pleas of world leaders, titans of industry and even the Pope himself, the president has placed himself at odds with not only the G7, but all 195 nations who backed the deal. 
And, despite his determination to put ‘America First’ and ‘Make It Great Again’, Trump has only expressed contempt for the rules-based world order, eroded Washington's standing in the globe, whilst casting the US as a climate pariah. 
To to quote former US Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers: “We may have our first post-rational president”. And, in the words of John Kerry: “This is one of the most self-destructive moves I have ever seen by any president in my lifetime.” 
Make no mistake: this marks the end of the US-led world order. 
Alas, the tragedy of the situation can not be overstated. It represents nothing short of complete apathy towards the gravest threat facing man kind.
According to the UN, without concerted global action, world temperatures will race past the 4C mark well before the turn of this century, ushering in earth shattering changes not seen since the last Ice Age. This in turn will trigger a mass extinction event which may make the elimination of the dinosaurs seem like a bedtime story. 
The move drew instant fire from one of the key architects behind the deal Barack Obama. Releasing a statement almost simultaneously as Trump released his, the former president said:
 “The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created. I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack.”
But, vilification was perhaps most fierce amongst America’s closest G7 allies: ""I say to everyone who values the future of our planet, for the sake of Mother Nature, let’s continue together on the path to success” said German Chancellor Angela Merkel. And, playing on the Trump’s mantra to 'Make America Great Again', Emmanuel Macron, the new French leader made calls to: ‘Make Our Planet Great Again.”
The Tycoon Tweeter's announcement came after weeks of intense debate within the White House. Despite pleas from his daughter Ivanka and Secretary of State, Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon urged Trump stand by his pledge to pull out of the pact, and to remain loyal to his base whose support was beginning to wane. 
""I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris” he said: “It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania before Paris, France.”
And, it was like salve to the wounds of the blue collar Americans who elected him because they were sick of globalisation and all of its perceived ills. 
But, as Solomon writes in the Book of Ecclesiastes ""Vanity of vanities; all is vanity"", it was a craven move which put Trump’s political self-interest ahead of the lives of millions of people. 
And, despite his campaign pledge to bring back coal, a lot of those jobs are lost forever owing to automation. Moreover, the dirty fossil fuel will only continue to face stiff competition from America's vast supply of cheap natural gas. Plus, US wind and solar power now employ almost 3 times as many people as the coal sector.
But, the move does enable Trump to deflect some attention away from his growing list of legislative failures and the ever widening Russia scandal which has now engulfed his inner circle, potentially claiming the scalp of his personal adviser and son in law Jared Kushner.
Bizarrely, the property tycoon still managed to sow confusion by claiming that the US will start to renegotiate the Paris accord on more favourable terms: “We will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great. And if we can’t, that’s fine. 
The comment is not only completely farcical, but wholly unrealistic: the world has no appetite to forge a new deal to replace one that was so painstakingly crafted in the first place. The Paris accord is the end product of nearly 20 years of torturous climate talks. In the past, rich and poor nations clashed over who should make the bulk of cuts, but as the science grew more terrifying, nearly 200 nations overcame their differences and struck a deal for the sake of posterity. 
A next to impossible achievement in high diplomatic art, the 2015 accord was hailed as a historic victory for mankind.
But, what a difference one US election makes. 
After all, if the world's second largest polluter heads towards the exit, then why shoud everyone else stay on board? Plus, there is now the risk that remaining nations will only backslide and water down their commitments.
But, countries across the world do have one weapon at their disposal: they can punish Trump’s climate vandalism with economic sanctions, and carbon border taxes. Members of the Paris accord should make it clear that they will not tolerate free riders, and countries that shirk their climate responsibilities will pay the price, especially the US. 
After all, historically it has polluted the atmosphere more than any other nation on earth. And, on a per capita basis, it is still the world's worst offender with the average American releasing twice as many CO2 emissions than someone living in either Europe or Japan.
As climate author Naomi Klein writes: “When you unilaterally decide to burn the world, there should be a price to pay. And that should be true whether you are the United States government, or Exxon Mobil — or some Frankenstein merger of the two.” 
Nevertheless, the EU and China have already vowed to fill the void left by the US's withdrawal by forging a new green alliance. By 2020, the two powerhouses hope to raise $100 billion a year to help poorer countries meet their climate commitments. 
Some commentators have even suggested that Beijing may take up the mantle of climate champion in the wake of Amerca’s retreat. After all, it was the Chinese president together with Obama who spearheaded the treaty in the first place. Moreover, the country’s coal use has fallen of the third year running, plus it’s installing enough solar panels to cover 3 football pitches every hour. 
Although we may live in a world which America in part made, Trump is now “rapidly unmaking it”, and as the FT's Martin Wolf notes: “We cannot ignore that grim reality."" In spite of being in power for less than 6 months, “he has revolutionised our ideas of what the US stands for.” And, as long as America continues its retreat into itself, other nations such as China will only fill the void and take over its crown as global leader. 
Moreover, by choosing to pull out of the pact, Trump has only made climate change a dynamite issue during the next presidential race. Although he may be hoping that this will play to his advantage, his actions may backfire as a record number of Americans are now concerned about global warming. And, this will only benefit his Democratic rival. 
Theoretically, a new president can re-enter the pact under executive agreement, and it will only take 30 days to take effect. That means that the US may only be out of the agreement for a few months. And, whilst it is sad that the climate movement has arrived at this dark juncture, it shall not be derailed by one badly coiffed buffoon whose mark in history will hopefully be short lived. 
As Bill McKibben writes in the New York Times: ""It our duty to make sure that history will judge Donald Trump’s name with the contempt it deserves. Not just because he didn’t take climate change seriously, but because he didn’t take civilisation seriously.”

445,GREEN,Even A Museum Dedicated To Coal Is Powering Itself On Renewable Energy,Rebecca Shapiro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kentucky-coal-mining-museum-solar-panels_us_58e71792e4b0cdad578e9885,The Kentucky Coal Mining Museum is installing solar panels.,2017-04-07,ENVIRONMENT,"Of all buildings to run on renewable energy, a museum dedicated to coal wouldn’t immediately come to mind.
But the Kentucky Coal Mining Museum in Benham is installing solar panels on its roof to cut energy costs, reports local CBS news station WYMT.
The building is owned by Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College. The move has been described as “a little ironic” by the college’s communications director, Brandon Robinson, and by former state Rep. Roger Noe.
The Associated Press wondered if it was merely “a sign of our times.”
Robinson told WYMT that the college expects to save $8,000 to $10,000 a year on energy costs.
According to a town website, Benham, in Harlan County, Kentucky, describes itself as “the little town that International Harvester, coal miners and their families built!”
A former coal camp town, Benham once had a population of 3,000, according to the Associated Press, and now has about 500 residents.
The museum is dedicated to “the life of a coal miner and his family as they struggled to make a life for themselves not knowing how valuable their contributions were to the industrialization of the 20th century.”

446,GREEN,'Red' Voters Or 'Blue' Voters -- They're All Green,"Will  Rogers, ContributorPresident of The Trust for Public Land",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/red-voters-or-blue-voters-theyre-all-green_us_59fb4750e4b09afdf01c40f4,While next week’s gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia will draw the most attention from the media and political,2017-11-02,ENVIRONMENT,"While next week’s gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia will draw the most attention from the media and political pundits, there are a number of other measures voters in other states will decide. We are confident that those results will show, once again, that on at least one subject, Americans are more united than ever, whether they are “red” or “blue” voters. 
That subject is creating parks and protecting open space and natural areas. Parks and conservation have united Americans for decades and likely will again when the votes are tallied Tuesday.
From deep red Texas to the bluest parts of New Jersey, 27 state and local ballot measures will be decided next week and if enacted, they would generate over $1 billion dollars for parks and open spaces. 
· In Monmouth County, New Jersey. voters will choose whether to approve a property tax that would generate $280 million for parks, water quality, and farmland. If past is prologue, Monmouth voters will pass this measure just as they have four similar measures over the past thirty years, generating hundreds of millions for open space. The vote comes a year after Monmouth voters gave Donald Trump a margin of almost 2-1 in the presidential race.
· In Dallas, Texas, voters will choose whether to approve $261 million for a park and recreation bond and $50 million bond for improvements to Fair Park. The region gave Hillary Clinton almost a 2-1 margin in 2016.
· In Pinellas County, Florida, voters may authorize, for the fourth time, a one-cent sales tax known as the “Penny for Pinellas.” Part of this money will be set aside to protect water, parks, and trails. The tax was first approved by voters in 1989 and the latest version will generate about $64 million for parks and trails. Pinellas is known as one of the bellwether “swing” Florida counties, and Trump won it by a single point, 49% to 48% last fall, enroute to narrowly carrying the state.
We’re optimistic voters will approve most of next week’s measures, because they consistently have across the country. Thus far in 2017, 10 of 11 local park and open space ballot measures have passed, including three in areas Clinton carried last year, and the other seven in areas Trump won. One example is Licking County, Ohio. Earlier this year, Licking voters easily gave 60%-40% passage for a property tax which pays for county parks. The margin is similar to the 61%-33% margin by which Trump won the county in 2016. 
Local elected officials are agreeing with their voters and taking a stand for parks. Last month, 134 mayors from across the country committed to ensuring their residents have access to a nearby park within a 10-minute walk of home. Almost two dozen Republican mayors joined the campaign, including mayors like Mick Cornett of Oklahoma City, who leads a city Trump won last year.
The 2017 successes come after a similar series of wins in 2016. Last November, as Trump’s victory dominated the news, voters also passed 70 local parks measures, providing $6.9 billion for parks and conservation. Earlier in 2016, another 14 local park spending measures passed, creating an additional $4.2 billion for parks and conservation, meaning $11 billion for the whole year.
Those results weren’t surprising. The Trust for Public Land has tracked state and local park and conservation spending measures going back more than 30 years. Year after year, in good times and bad, voters approve three of every four park and land conservation ballot measures, regardless of whether they are Republicans, Democrats, or Independents. 
That is a remarkable record, and belies the drumbeat of commentary we regularly hear, that Americans are divided as never before. Perhaps they are on some issues, but when it comes to parks and open space, U.S. voters remain united and consistent in their support for our public lands and their desire to protect water quality, conserve natural areas, and create new parks where they live, work and play, even if it means increasing taxes.

447,GREEN,Judge Rejects $2.4 Million Fine For Oil Company Over Blast That Killed 7,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tesoro-anacortes-explosion-fine_us_59398e1fe4b0c5a35c9d50cf,State officials had said the Tesoro Anacortes refinery explosion was the oil company's fault.,2017-06-11,ENVIRONMENT,"A state appeals judge has rejected a $2.4 million dollar fine for an oil company after a refinery explosion killed seven workers.
State officials imposed the fine on Texas company Tesoro in October 2010, over a blast in Anacortes, Washington, that occurred April that year. It was the largest workplace-safety fine in Washington state history, local NPR member station KUOW reports.
But late last week, Judge Mark Jaffe of the Washington State Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals overturned the fine, saying the state had not shown that the deadly explosion was Tesoro’s fault. The company had been appealing the fine for years — though it did pay millions of dollars to the families of the victims.
The local news website, GoSkagit.com, reports that Jaffe’s ruling must still be approved by the board.
The explosion occurred at the Tesoro’s Anacortes refinery when a heat exchanger ruptured. The rupture released extremely hot hydrogen and naphtha, which ignited. The ensuing explosion was so intense that many people felt a shock wave across the nearby Fidalgo Bay, and a huge fireball shot into the sky over the refinery, the Seattle Times reported at the time. (The outlet’s report was published before the final death toll.)
Seven workers — Daniel Aldridge, Matt Bowen, Matt Gumbel, Darrin Hoines, Lew Janz, Kathryn Powell and Donna Van Dreumel — died from injuries sustained in the blast, according to KUOW.
The state’s Department of Labor and Industries accused Tesoro of dozens of violations that contributed to the explosion, and these alleged violations led to officials handing down the $2.4 million fine.
“Our position has been that had Tesoro conducted the appropriate and required testing, they would have found the cracking that led to the rupture,” department spokesman Hector Castro told Reuters in 2011.
But Judge Jaffe wrote in his ruling on Thursday that the state was “unable to really articulate what Tesoro did or did not do to cause the explosion.”
The Washington Department of Labor and Industries, however, is not the only group that has blamed the company for the disaster.
The U.S. Chemical Safety Board said in 2011 that Tesoro inadequately maintained the heat exchanger that exploded, Reuters reported at the time. The CSB released its final report on the catastrophe in 2014, citing a “substandard safety culture at Tesoro, which led to a complacent attitude toward flammable leaks and occasional fires over the year.”
The company has repeatedly asserted it was not at fault for the explosion and that its heat exchanger maintenance was in line with industry standards and regulations.
Tesoro spokesman Matt Gill told GoSkagit.com that the company supported Judge Jaffe’s decision.

448,GREEN,9 Gorgeous Houses That Prove Your Dream Home Is Also A Green Home,Jonathan Feldman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/green-building-home-technology_n_5642395.html,,2014-08-08,ENVIRONMENT,"What is sustainability, and what would it look like in your own home? There are a lot of things you can do to reduce your carbon footprint, like going vegetarian or driving an electric car, but chances are your house maybe be having a larger impact on the environment than you'd like. 
Almost half of the energy your home consumes comes from heating and air conditioning. Unless your house is completely coated in solar panels, more than half of the electricity you're using is probably generated from coal, gas and oil. 
""Green building"" is an effort to curb the environmental toll of inefficient homes, and it's taking hold in the construction sector. The Huffington Post reached out to nine architects to talk about their stunning projects that are not only sustainable, but beautiful too.
1. This beautiful butterfly alights on the California hills -- and saves you water.  Spreading its wings out over the hills of Northern California, Feldman Architecture's Butterfly House thrusts its owners into the drama of its perch. Not only is the house itself beautiful, but looking out its wall of completely open windows its hard not to be overcome by the drama of the view, says principal architect Jonathan Feldman*. 
""When the clouds go over [the hills] or the fog rolls in, they suddenly become these really cool, exciting personalities that people are living through,"" Feldman told The Huffington Post. ""It’s cool to have a nice photograph on your wall but these guys are immersed in that landscape every day of the year.""
The shape of the roof allowed Feldman and his team to incorporate something that he is most excited about: rainwater collection. With California's recent drought strengthening its grip on residents, rainwater collectors can be assets for people willing to spend a little bit more money. ""The long view is worth considering,"" Feldman said. 
In the long run, strategizing how a house uses water -- including used water -- can significantly reduce the pressure a home puts on the environment. ""People need to take this water shortage way more seriously,"" Feldman said, but added that other projects are showing new possibilities. ""We have urban projects where we’re using all the shower water and laundry water to flush the toilets and water the landscapes. That’s something I’m super excited about.""
*The architect Jonathan Feldman is not related to the author of this story, also named Jonathan Feldman.
 
2. Recycling has never looked this good.  Situated on Orcas Island in Washington, architect Gary Gladwish's Eagle Ridge Residence emphasizes the use of recyclable materials. ""I don't rule something out just because it's used,"" Gladwish told HuffPost. ""Some of the appliances, the fireplace, all of the wood siding, the material for the bathroom counters, all of that was used, upcycled or recycled material.""
The Eagle Ridge Residence also uses structural insulated panels, which can cut down on waste and costs considerably. The panels save time in construction, produce less waste on the site and save money in energy costs, since less heat is escaping the structure. 
""The waste stream in this country is greatly contributed to by construction,"" Gladwish said. In building the home, all the waste generated by its construction was taken off site in five loads in an SUV. According to the project's description, the majority of this waste was recyclable as well. 
 
3. A little positioning can make spending on heating and air conditioning a thing of the past.  Los Angeles's Manifold House takes advantage of southern California's year-round warm climate to control the home's temperature. Using strategic positioning and careful planning of the home's indoor shapes, architect Aaron Neubert and his team from ANX push toward ""passive"" solutions to keep their buildings naturally cool. 
What really interests Neubert is how knowledge of passive ventilation has fundamentally changed the design process. ""If you're bringing fresh air through plant material or over water, it increases the cooling of the space, and the question becomes how do you make that beautiful?"" he told HuffPost. ""It becomes interesting, because you're not just talking about aesthetics with the client, you're talking about performance."" 
In the Manifold House, windows and vents within the home can help keep the house at the desired temperature. This precise tuning of the air channels in the house completely removes the need for typical air conditioning systems.
 
4. Solar panels can be easy on your eyes -- and your wallet.  In Menlo Park, California, the Low/Rise House uses an electrifying approach to keep the house very low-carbon: an array of solar panels. Hidden from view along the home's flat roof surfaces, the array reduces the overall energy demand of the house significantly. The house is also positioned to remove the need for air conditioning during the day, even when it gets to be hotter than 100 degrees. Together, there is almost no draw on the grid for power.
""In order for green building to be successful, sustainability shouldn't be obvious, it should be an integral part of your design,"" principal architect Dan Spiegel of the Spiegel Aihara Worshop told HuffPost. Even though the solar panels are nearly invisible, they will provide the house with almost all its power, and pay themselves back in less than five years. 
To keep the house tightly insulated, the solar panels aren't bolted to the roof. No holes are drilled through the building envelope; instead, ballasts keep the solar panels in place and ensure that if the solar array ever needs to be adjusted, the roof will not be needlessly damaged.
 
5. What could be better than a house on Martha's Vineyard? A house MADE OF Martha's Vineyard.  Driving through a grove of trees and a meadow on Martha's Vineyard, you'll come across what architect Peter Rose calls ""good behavior in a precious landscape."" The Island House by Peter Rose + Partners in Edgartown, Massachusetts is a green vacation home for a family of five that does its best to have a low impact on the island.
""The house is almost invisible, and much smaller than the house it replaced,"" Rose told HuffPost. What gives the house its cloak of invisibility is its wood siding, made of unfinished wood that weathers naturally over time, and a green roof, populated by local sea grasses. The roof collects water into a cistern, irrigates the land around the house and keeps the house independent in terms of its water use.
""Martha's Vineyard is one of the most precious, beautiful places in this world,"" Rose said. When designing the home, providing the owners with the opportunity to experience the location was key. Passive cooling keeps the temperature stable, even when letting the outside in. ""When the windows open up, you drift into a beautiful landscape."" 
 
6. With a bit of planning, you can build a normal sized house with 30 percent fewer trees.  ""Getting a building right, so it endures, is the first step,"" SHED Architecture & Design's Thomas Schaer said about the construction of the Main Street House in Seattle, Washington. The house uses advanced framing and a bit of extra planning to significantly cut down on its material usage and costs. 
""In standard framing, you don't need to align your studs, and there's so much extra wood, it's almost idiot proof,"" Schaer said in an interview with HuffPost. ""But with advanced framing, with extra care and planning, you can use 30 percent less of everything."" Advanced framing also prevents the transfer of heat from the interior to the exterior, creating more insulation, which keeps the house's temperature more steady. 
Requiring less materials then means requiring less lumber for construction. Areas the size of Panama are cut down every year for wood and paper products, and advanced framing can be a driving force for reducing our demand for wood. Schaer says that this is a common practice in Canada, but the United States has been slow to move away from standard framing.
 
7. Get rid of your heating and air conditioning and replace it with...concrete?  To architect Ted Cameron of DeForest Architects, sustainability is more than being fashionable in looking for solutions; true progress is made in designs that have more than just ""green lipstick on."" His Courtyard House, situated on Lake Washington in Seattle, is certainly fashionable, but its structure is what makes it so green.
Much of the Courtyard House's structure is made of concrete, which uses radiant heating to keep the house's temperature regulated. ""The radiant floor of the house evens out the spiking of temperature,"" Cameron said. The home faces the sun and absorbs heat during the day, and then uses its stored heat to stay comfortable at night. ""The house cools down at night and stays cool at night,"" even without an air conditioning system.
""There is a trend to return to modernism now, but green building won't fall out of favor,"" Cameron said. ""Resources and fossil fuels can't just be wasted anymore.""
 
8. Don't sacrifice; you can still live large even if you build small.  Large homes are a symbol of status in the United States, but architect Craig Steely asks, ""Do you really need to build that big?"" Lavaflow 5, overlooking the Pacific Ocean on the island of Hawaii, is remarkably small. At 1,100 square feet, it provides a comfortable home that uses as much energy as it generates. 
By stripping away extraneous materials and space, the footprint of construction becomes much smaller. ""I've always been inspired by how good buildings look before they're finished,"" Steely said in a phone interview. ""They look compelling, powerful and strong; but then they become covered, clad, buried and killed in layers of requirement."" Steely's skeletal structure is all ""sharp and bones,"" which affords less space for rot and mold to grow.
The small frame and roof of the house were prefabricated in San Francisco and shipped to Hawaii, where they were assembled in five days. The house also uses passive cooling to keep the house at a comfortable temperature and a solar heating system to provide the home with hot water without the need for gas. 
 
9. Seal your envelope tight and heat your home with a hair dryer.  ""This house is a vision of how things should be. Energy and water are two of our top priorities,"" said Joe Giampietro of NK Architects. ""If you're building any other way, your house is outdated as soon as its done,"" builder Sloan Ritchie agreed. The Park Passive House in Seattle, designed by NK's Marie Ljubojevic and Lauren McCunney, has cut its energy consumption by 90 percent thanks to the careful design of the architect and builder.
""We really try to balance with the environment,"" Giampietro told HuffPost. Part of what helps the house conserve energy so effectively is its tight envelope; the envelope prevents the outside temperature from affecting the inside temperature when all the windows and doors are closed and allows heat to spread through the house easily. ""Theoretically, the net energy needs of the house can be met by a small heat source, like a hair dryer,"" he said.
Jennifer Ritchie is the wife of Sloan Ritchie, and together they live in the home comfortably. Ms. Ritchie, accustomed to her previous home, had difficulty managing all the captured heat at first, but quickly learned how to keep the house cool all day. ""I owned a 1912 Craftsman home that had been ordered out of a Sears catalog that wasn't even insulated,"" she said. ""With the multi-locking windows and insulation, it makes things really quiet and it reduces our electricity and gas bills significantly.""

It is much easier to turn the TV on, check out and give into your symptoms. However, with chronic illness, this isn't always the best thing to do.
Staying active, even in a limited capacity, can speed recovery, keep your mind sharp, help retain mobility and possibly ease symptoms -- the same symptoms that would prevent being active in the first place. 
It is important to find balance between exertion that helps and exertion that wipes you out. Work with your health care team and use trial and error to find the level of activity that is right for you and your diagnosis. 
Being active doesn't always have to look like heavy physical exercise. There are even things you can do even from bed on days when symptoms prevent mobility. Give yourself a nudge and experiment with these 10 ways to stay active:
Walk: Maybe marathons are out, but walking has a myriad of benefits. Start with short 15-minute strolls around your neighborhood or a local park.
Yoga: You can get gentle yoga DVDs to start a practice right in your living room or join a local class. Many yoga studios offer gentle yoga or yoga for people coping with health issues. The meditative aspect of yoga will also reduce stress.
Water Aerobics: The decrease in gravity is easier on sore muscles and joints while still improving flexibility and cardiovascular strength. You do not need to be a strong swimmer, or hold your breath to participate. 
Work With a Trainer: A trainer who specializes in chronic illness will be able to offer a workout routine that is tailor made to your abilities. A good trainer will keep you motivated and accountable, even when your health wants to let you slide. 
Go to Physical Therapy: If your diagnosis involves a loss of mobility, talk with your primary care physician about seeing a physical therapist. They can help you retain the mobility you have and regain flexibility and strength. They will also teach you simple exercises you can do at home to stay active.
Get Outside: Just 15 minutes in the sun enjoying the breeze and view will deliver essential vitamin D and boost your mood. If you're feeling adventurous go for a drive in the country or a relaxing boat tour of your local harbor.
Refresh: Even if you are planning to stay in bed for the day, take a shower and change into new clothing. Before you climb back into bed, sit in a chair or on the couch in a different area of the house. This can be especially important to ease back into movement after surgery. 
Make Dates: Schedule time to meet up with a friend for coffee or to have a visitor to your home. Having something on the calendar provides a bright moment to look forward to. 
Join a Book Club: You can find a variety of book clubs for all genres. Having others read along with you is a good way to stay socially active and to have a completion deadline. If you can't get out of the house, there are virtual book clubs meeting all over the internet.
Care for a Pet: Visit your local shelter to see if there is a furry friend suited to your abilities who needs a home. There is no better motivation than the unconditional love of a pet to get you walking, playing and cuddling.
Illness is a challenge, but one you are capable of meeting. You can do more than you think that you can. Work with your doctors to stay active and engaged which can help you not only cope but thrive.

Kamal Patel is the director of Examine.com, and is a nutrition researcher with an MPH and MBA from Johns Hopkins University on hiatus from a Ph.D. in nutrition. He has published peer-reviewed articles on vitamin D and calcium as well as a variety of clinical research topics.
Even the most dedicated athletes need time off to unwind. While partying usually results in nothing worse than a hangover, you may have also noticed that your Monday morning gym session feels harder after a weekend of indulging. While many people extol the virtues of the post-workout beer, it can be difficult to determine what effect alcohol actually has on muscles.
Some research shows that alcohol can impact your rate of muscle protein synthesis -- the process by which muscles grow and repair. But could a post-workout drink (or two) really undo the effects of your reps and sets -- or will it take way more than that to truly set you back? Read on to find out.
Breaking Down the Post-Workout Beer
Beer, like many sports drinks, contains carbohydrates and electrolytes. But does that mean it could replace a Gatorade? Not so fast.
Two relevant studies published on this topic compared liver protein synthesis rates -- the detoxifying enzymes produced by the liver -- among people consuming various quantities of alcohol. Scientists found that the rate of synthesis changed based on the amount of alcohol ingested. Protein synthesis was suppressed by 24 percent after people consumed 71 grams of pure alcohol, or approximately five beers. However, it was not suppressed after people consumed just 28 grams of alcohol, the amount found in about two standard beers.
The most relevant human study to date found that for a 150-pound person, consuming the equivalent of about seven beers resulted in suppressed muscle protein synthesis. This occurred even if the alcohol was consumed after 25 grams of protein (see what 25 grams of protein looks like here). In other words, your post-happy hour munchies won't help. Animal studies also provide supporting evidence; muscular protein synthesis rates in rats were suppressed after they received ethanol injections.
Overall, this evidence suggests drinking upwards of five beers in one sitting could impair workout recovery and muscle growth. There are no studies specifically investigating the impact of a single beer post-workout. But those who love a good post-gym drink will be happy to know evidence suggests drinking about two of your favorite brews won't undo your hard work at the gym.
Alcohol and Testosterone
Testosterone is also important when it comes to building muscle -- the more you naturally have, the easier it is to see gains. Low doses of alcohol (about two beers for a 150-pound person) have been shown to increase circulating testosterone by about 17 percent in both young men and premenopausal women. Unfortunately, this boost in testosterone is probably not enough to noticeably increase muscle growth.
On the other hand, heavier drinking (think: seven beers for a 150-pound individual) has been found to suppress testosterone. Furthermore, even moderate amounts of booze (about three to four beers) have been shown to mildly suppress testosterone when ingested daily for at least three weeks. And that could be enough to undo some of your efforts in the weight room.
The Big Picture
Beer lovers, rest easy. Though more research is needed, there is currently no evidence to suggest a post-workout beer or two can cause long-term harm. If a tall one is your go-to treat after a hard workout, you don't need to worry about your testosterone levels or protein synthesis rates. Just make sure your one-beer reward doesn't turn into a five-beer habit.

Most of us mothers can remember that moment as if it were yesterday.
The power of that experience, whether you bonded with your child or not, set in motion a force of neural-connections, forevermore establishing the foundation for your child’s future.
Today, neuroscience -- including epigenetics and the use of technology - shows us what parents and educators have long suspected: your child needs quality bonding time with other human beings from the very beginning, especially from his/her parents.
Scientific studies support nurture over nature
Based on these studies, we can put the old argument of nurture versus nature to rest. The question of whether your child’s genes or your child’s environment affects the outcome of your child’s development has now been settled by scientific data. Your child’s brain development is influenced almost equally by both his genetic predisposition and the experiences that impact the way those genes express themselves.
For example, animal studies going back to the 1940s have indicated that primates who are deprived of mother after birth will not only fixate on any available object as mother, but if further deprived of social interaction, will develop mental illness and depression. Mice who are isolated from mother and denied her instinctive and constant licking, overproduce cortisol in their blood, which distorts the natural expression of their genes and changes the structure of their developing brain. This not only negatively affects their IQ, but also makes them more highly strung and less able to handle stress.
Another famous 30-year longitudinal study followed 13 borderline intellectually disabled (ID) newborns that were placed in an orphanage. Each day an ID teenager was assigned the same newborn and, under supervision, was just asked to hold and cuddle the baby. At the end of one year, 13 of the 13 newborns were no longer borderline ID. Eleven were adopted out and their progress was followed over the years. Many of them went on to white-collar careers, such as teaching, accounting, and so forth. However, the two children left behind in the orphanage, slipped back into their intellectual disabilities.
Nature builds a blueprint, nurture secures the final foundation
Though genes layout a blueprint for your child’s potential development, they do not distinguish the direction in which your child will grow. In a sense, the environment instructs your child’s genes by enhancing some, while turning off others. For example, your child may have the genetic predisposition to be long and lean but if he/she eats a high carb diet and fails to exercise, he/she may grow up overweight. This is also true of your child’s capacity for memory, learning, emotional disposition, coping skills, and so on.

453,HEALTHY LIVING,A Mile and Change,"David Willey, ContributorEditor-in-Chief, 'Runner’s World' Magazine",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-mile-and-change_b_6270728.html,,2014-12-10,HALTH & WELLNESS,"Earlier this year, I came out of my winter running hiatus thinking about a new goal. Feeling a bit burned out by half and full marathon training, I recalled a terrific piece we'd published last year, ""The Mulligan Mile."" Amid a disintegrating marriage, the author, Louis Cinquino, set out to run a five-minute mile at age 50, a mark he very nearly hit as a high-schooler. Huh. The mile.
The fastest one I ever ran was a 5:31, when I was 26 and doing weekly speed workouts with the New York Road Runners Club to prepare for the 1994 New York City Marathon. We ran mile repeats around the Great Lawn in Central Park on Thursday nights, hard against the glowing midtown skyline. It was beautiful and awful all at once. When I think about that 5:31, I can almost taste a metallic tang in my mouth. It was the closest I've ever come to vomiting because of exercise. But two decades later, at 46, I decided to see if I could run a hair faster. A 5:30. It would be a reach, but this year -- the 60th anniversary of Roger Bannister's first sub-four mile and the 50th anniversary of Jim Ryun's first sub-four high-school mile -- seemed like the right time to try. 
Plus, the mile is making a comeback. It's been a long time since the distance has really mattered in our sporting landscape (track-and-field events, of course, now feature the slightly shorter 1,500 meters), but since 1999 the number of one-mile road races in America has more than doubled to 700, according to Bring Back the Mile, which has put on 20 competitive mile races in the past two years, awarding almost $100,000 in prize money in 2014. The Fifth Avenue Mile in New York City began in 1981 with 52 runners. This year, more than 5,600 people finished. Perhaps best of all, running just one mile may do the most good for the greatest number of people. New research shows that short, intense exercise may offer better health benefits than higher mileage provides. And the mile is a gateway. ""Most people can't or won't do a 5K, let alone a marathon,"" says Ryan Lamppa, founder of BBTM. ""But most people can do four laps on a track. This is the ideal distance for getting sedentary people of all ages off the couch and out the door."" 
Coach Coates (left) and student.
I coaxed several colleagues into training with me, and Budd Coates, RW's in-house coach extraordinaire, put us on a training plan. We began in May, and every Wednesday at noon we threw ourselves into 100s, quarters, halfs, and three-quarter-mile repeats on a gravel path behind our offices or on the local high-school track. Everything was fast. We ran several miles' worth of intense intervals interspersed with slightly less intense recovery intervals. Compared with the distance training I'd gotten accustomed to, with its moderately paced long runs, this was like moving from a cabin in the woods to the middle of Manhattan. I even needed a new mantra for when things got ugly, as my go-to, ""Run the mile you're in,"" was useless. 
In June, we ran our first time trial on the track. My splits were all over the place, but I managed a 5:55. Not bad, but I learned that a 5:30 would require me to run at the very edge of my fitness and ability -- and that this could be fun, even addictive. After a couple of rusty weeks, my cadence began to change and I felt stronger, healthier, better than ever. In fact, all the speedwork saw me through our Heartbreak Hill Hat Trick (a 5K, 10K, and half-marathon) in June, as well as three summer triathlons, one of them my best ever.
On our next attempt, Jeff Dengate, who at the time was RW's Gear Guy, agreed to be my rabbit. But he didn't so much pace me as race me. A 5:30 calls for 82- or 83-second quarters; he went out in 78. I followed, crashed, and clocked a 5:36. But I learned a bit more: The first quarter is crucial. Start too fast and you're doomed, even more so than in distance running. 
Going out too hard (again) on Fifth Avenue.
In September, I decided to try a road mile and ran in the media heat of the Fifth Avenue Mile. Did I employ the first lesson above? I did not. My first quarter was... 72 -- even Dengate was behind me (but not for long). Doomed again, I ran a 2:57 second half and, as Megan Hetzel, one of my training partners, flew past me on the home stretch, I finished in 5:37. But I learned a bit more: Running at the edge of your ability in a marathon feels like you will run out of gas; in the mile, it feels like you'll combust. The pain is more jagged. It's a bungee-jump, frightening but short-lived. When it's over, you want to try again, trusting that you'll get a touch more comfortable amid the pain and that this new tolerance will translate into time, or less of it. John L. Parker, Jr. put it perfectly in his classic novel Once a Runner, whose protagonist, Quenton Cassidy, was a miler: ""Training was a rite of purification; from it came speed, strength. Racing was a rite of death; from it came knowledge. Such rites demand, if they are to be meaningful at all, a certain amount of time spent precisely on the Red Line."" 
Hoping to catch RW Reporter Megan Hetzel (who finished in 5:36) on the homestretch, but really just trying not to fall over.
Four days later I went back to the track -- with a new rabbit. Liam Boylan-Pett, an associate editor at Running Times, ran competitively at Columbia and has broken four minutes eight times. His PR is 3:53.7. He had no need to race me and promised to stay on pace. As if on cue, there was a fire drill at the high school, so a couple thousand kids began filing into the bleachers just as we finished our warmup. Suddenly, we had a crowd. 
Liam was spot on: an 81 first quarter and 2:45 at the half. A bunch of the kids screamed ""RUN!"" But my wheels wobbled on the third lap. Liam tried to wait for me while holding a pace that would still give us a chance. Repeating my new mantra (""turnover, turnover, it's almost over""), I tried to kick on the last lap, which was 88 or 89 (frankly, I don't remember). A 5:40. I lay on my back on the infield trying to breathe and thinking, Really? I hurt that much and ran slower? But that sense of futility turned into something like optimism, because I had learned a bit more: The first quarter is crucial, but the third quarter is the key, and the hardest part of it all. You have to practice holding on before you can bring it home.
A colleague has pointed out that the age-graded equivalent of my 5:36 would be a 5:03. This is satisfying, I guess, but I'm still reaching, still learning. My mile is a work in progress, and even though I shifted back to long distances in the fall, I will come back to it. Running at the edge of your ability has its own rewards, and you won't always find them on your watch.

454,HEALTHY LIVING,6 Ways To Get More Love In Your Life,"Karen M. Wyatt, M.D., ContributorAuthor, 'What Really Matters: 7 Lessons for Living from the St...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/more-love-in-your-life_b_7596702.html,"While many of us are searching for romantic love, remember that true love comes in many different forms and circumstances. Getting more love in your life requires more than dating tips; you'll have to work at it and make some inner changes to find love that has deeper meaning.",2015-06-27,HALTH & WELLNESS,"The Beatles said it best: ""Love is all you need."" But do you feel you have enough love in your personal life? According to a 2010 survey by the Fetzer Institute, 68 percent of Americans say they need more meaningful love in their lives and 95 percent believe that we need more love in the world.
Since love is one of the most basic human emotions, how can it be that so many of us find it lacking in our lives? We see the word ""love"" used everywhere these days in advertising for material goods like hamburgers, cars, shoes, eyeglasses and cosmetics. But the genuine love that so many of us long for in our lives involves so much more than the excitement we feel over our favorite footwear.
True love is a powerful, creative force that can inspire humans to write symphonies, trek for months on foot, build a massive mausoleum, and make superhuman sacrifices. But love also leaves us feeling vulnerable and opens us up to possible rejection. Love requires courage, patience and effort, which are difficult to maintain in our fast-paced, superficial society.
While many of us are searching for romantic love, remember that true love comes in many different forms and circumstances. Getting more love in your life requires more than dating tips; you'll have to work at it and make some inner changes to find love that has deeper meaning. Here are some steps you can take to help you cultivate true love:
# 1. Love Yourself First
Before you can share love with others you have to feel it within yourself. That means you need to find practices and routines that help you genuinely love who you are, just as you are right now. 
Try taking yourself on a ""date"" once a week and spend time alone, doing something you thoroughly enjoy. For example: 
Linger with a latte and a good book at your favorite coffee shop
Take a walk in nature
Visit an art gallery or museum that inspires you
Attend a concert
Watch a video about love
As you spend this time with yourself, focus your intention on truly loving YOU and filling yourself up with positive feelings and energy. The more you concentrate on loving yourself the more you will radiate positive feelings of love toward others and attract their love in return.
#2. Recognize Your Barriers to Love
The Sufi poet and philosopher Rumi wrote: ""Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.""
Whether you realize it or not, you may have barriers hidden within you that prevent you from giving and receiving love. Perhaps you have been hurt or betrayed by a past relationship or you fear being vulnerable to other people.
Spend some time in contemplation and write in your journal about your past experiences with love and how you feel about giving yourself over to love. Once you identify your own internal barriers to love you will be able to heal your wounds from the past and rise above them. This is an important step if you want to deepen your ability to genuinely love others. 
#3 Practice the Lovingkindness Blessing 
This Buddhist blessing (also called ""Metta"") can be a powerful reminder to love yourself and others if you use it as a daily practice. Here are the five phrases of the blessing:
May I be at peace.
May my heart remain open.
May I realize the beauty of my own true nature.
May I be healed.
May I be a source of healing for this world.
Repeat this blessing every day as part of your daily practice and you will begin to feel your heart expanding with compassion for yourself and others. Next change the ""I"" in each phrase to ""you"" and use the blessing to send love to someone else.
#4. Give For the Sake of Giving
One of the best ways to bring more love into your life is to give your time and energy to others who need your help. Volunteer at an animal shelter, Head Start program, homeless shelter, or nursing home and you will find ample opportunities to share your love with others who need to be loved. 
When you give of yourself with no expectation of return, you will find that you are blessed in many ways and love will begin flowing through you freely. You will begin to attract others into your life who can appreciate your loving and generous behavior.
#5. Open Your Heart
The HeartMath Institute teaches a simple method for opening your heart to love called the Inner Ease Technique. Use this practice as part of your daily routine (along with the Lovingkindness Blessing) and you will soon be able to overcome the barriers to love you have identified. Here are the steps:
Place your hand on your heart area and imagine you are breathing in and out through your heart.
Breathe slowly and gently until your breathing feels smooth and balanced, not forced.
With each breath draw in a feeling of inner-ease, balance and self-love into your heart. 
You can do this practice in any place at any time to reduce anxiety and open yourself up to others.
#6. Find Love In Every Situation
As you open your heart to love and expand your capacity to express love for yourself and others, you will begin to see love everywhere you go. Then love can become your ""default mechanism"" so that you will choose love whenever you are in a situation of doubt or uncertainty.
For example, if a conflict arises with coworkers or a friend, choose the solution that contains the most love. If you face a crisis and must decide on your next steps, let love be your guide. When you need to give feedback to another person, be motivated by love rather than anger.
As you practice embodying love in your life in various ways, you will discover that you have always had all the love you need -- you just couldn't see it before. When you become a walking, talking vision of love you will become irresistible to other people who will be drawn to you by your beautiful presence. 
The entire world will benefit from the love you put into practice, as you radiate love out to others and create more happiness and joy wherever you go. The love the world needs is right there inside you -- now, go find it!

455,HEALTHY LIVING,Toasting 2017 Goodbye With Ketogenic Kool-Aid,"David L. Katz, M.D., M.P.H., ContributorFounder, True Health Initiative",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/toasting-2017-goodbye-with-ketogenic-kool-aid_us_5a44f4cae4b06cd2bd03de4f,"I cannot profess to know why ketogenic diets are the flavor of the week, other than the fact that there always is one of",2017-12-28,HALTH & WELLNESS,"I cannot profess to know why ketogenic diets are the flavor of the week, other than the fact that there always is one of those- ever in the interest of those selling them, and almost never in the interest of those buying. There is some fairly new, and quite rudimentary research on the topic that might be the reason for the current infatuation, but the pop culture claims are wildly at odds with those data, to say nothing of the overall weight of scientific evidence regarding diet and health. 
Whatever the reasons, legions seem poised to toast 2017 goodbye and welcome 2018 with ketogenic Kool-Aid, and I consider them dangerously mistaken. Before you join their misguided ranks, I suggest we drain this topic to its low-carb dregs and see where it leaves us.
The historical case for ketogenesis- denying the body its customary fuel sources so that glucose is in short supply, and instead it metabolizes fat preferentially, and generates ketone bodies as fuel- resides in starvation. Rather predictably, starvation has profound effects on all aspects of metabolism. The body effectively turns to auto-digestion to sustain itself during a protracted fast. Fat and protein stores in the body are converted to fuel, and metabolism then does run on ketone bodies.
In this modern age of epidemic obesity and type 2 diabetes, starvation has acquired a patina of merit. During starvation, blood sugar falls. Blood insulin falls. Blood cholesterol falls. Blood pressure falls. Weight declines. None of these were desirable throughout most of humanity’s subsistence, but all cry out “benefit” in this era of disease-by-excess.
But, alas, starvation has its drawbacks, among them the tendency to be fatal. When the body auto-digests, it is somewhat indiscriminate, and proteins can be leached even from vital organs such as the heart. That can disrupt micro-architecture, which can in turn disrupt electrical signaling, and that can and does cause fatal dysrhythmias. The first attempt to mimic the “benefits” of starvation medically, and thus arguably the fist ancestor to the current fixation on ketogenesis, was very low calorie liquid diets(VLCDs). These had the same drawback as actual starvation- periodic death by dysrhythmia- and have long since taken their place in the dust bin of bad ideas.
Starvation, then, is a dubious proposition- but the appeal of its metabolic advantages in modern context persists. This tension has propagated an on-going quest to secure the metabolic advantages of starvation without the pesky inconveniences of actually starving, and risking sudden cardiac death. The initial successful result of this effort was calorie restriction, or CR, or in another variant, the protein-sparing modified fast.
CR reduces calories to a level that imposes many of the effects of starvation. However, CR involves the very careful delivery of essential nutrients- including key proteins- so that the body does not auto-digest its own vital organs (hence, “protein sparing”). CR, like starvation, is ketogenic- achieving that effect not by restricting carbohydrate, but by restricting total calories. Most approaches to CR are, in fact, ketogenic despite being high in total carbohydrate from particularly nutrient-rich foods: notably vegetables, fruits, beans, and legumes. A primary principle of CR is to compensate for low-calorie intake with reliance on the foods richest in valuable nutrients.
CR is associated with certain liabilities, such as infertility, but appears to enhance longevity. This is clear in many species other than our own, and suggested for our own. But, CR involves something akin to “gentle starvation” every day, so there is a joke about it: maybe it makes you live forever, or maybe it just feels like forever!
This, then, is where the New-Age idea of ketogenic diets was incubated. The current hope is to have your CR benefits, but eat those calories, too. By restricting all carbohydrate sources, the body can be forced to run on ketone bodies even in the absence of semi-starvation.
There is a very serious problem with this concept, however, before we turn to the matter of evidence. The ketogenic diet idea makes the huge leap of faith that ketone bodies per se can confer health benefit. The work the idea is born from, however, establishes nothing of the sort. Starvation involves not just ketone bodies, but starvation- and is overall a very bad idea for the health-conscious. CR might be a good idea, at least for health-conscious masochists, but its benefits are decisively linked to low-intake of calories and high-intake of nutrient rich plant foods; ketone body generation just comes along for the ride.
What evidence is there that CR can be replaced with carbohydrate restriction; that nutrient-rich plant foods can be mostly or entirely displaced by meat – and the health or longevity benefits of CR, themselves less than entirely proven, replicated? To the best of my knowledge, in humans- absolutely none. Zero. The one known benefit of ketogenic diets is for the short-term control of otherwise intractable seizures, mostly in certain children.
There are, as noted, short-term studies of ketogenic diets showing the usual metabolic benefits attached to almost any diet replacing the prevailing state of ingestive anarchy with some kind of discipline: reduced blood sugar, blood cholesterol, blood pressure, and weight. But lest you think short-term improvements in these markers a good idea makes, consider these other “interventions” that do the same: a bout of cholera, a crack cocaine binge, the spread of cancer through one’s body, or the advance of tuberculosis. The historical name for tuberculosis, “consumption,” connotes exactly such effects; the infection eats away at you. Many life-threatening diseases evoke auto-digestion, and cause weight, cholesterol, glucose, insulin, and blood pressure to fall. They are all emphatically ill-advised just the same.
Perhaps the currently popular approach to ketogenic diets is a case apart, but the burden is on those making the claim to prove it- not on the rest of us to disprove it. They have a steep hill to climb. We have reason to wonder if the short-term “consumption” of ketogenesis turns into all the perks of a wasting disease over time for those rare individuals who can stick with it.
There is, for starters, no evidence that ketogenic diets are conducive to, or even compatible with, human health across the lifespan, or longevity. There is, instead, bountiful evidence that the very foods such diets exclude are associated with less diabetes, cancer, heart disease, dementia, and premature death in general. There is as well the experience of free-living populations. To date, every population group around the world found to experience remarkable vitality and longevity has a dietary pattern in which whole, nutrient-rich plant foods predominate, the very opposite of ketogenic. Vitality and longevity even in the last of the planet’s hunter-gatherers, or foragers, is similarly linked to a plant-predominant, high-carbohydrate diet.
So, OK, ketogenic diets might help people live long and prosper, but there are, to date, no such people. Admittedly, the Inuit, for want of choice, have a very low-carbohydrate diet which may at times be ketogenic, but they do not experience enviable health or longevity.
There is, as well, the inconvenience factor of being on a “diet” for the rest of one’s life. The argument for ketogenic diets reeks of fad, because like all fad diets, the benefits derive from eliminating most of the foods most people around the world like to eat. If ever there was a case of “fool me once, shame on you, fool me 10,000 times, shame on me,” the marketing of the next diet fad is surely it.
Arguments for ketogenesis as anything other than the next batch of Kool-Aid brewed specially for suckers need to navigate past all such impediments. There is more, however. While such diets are likely to be harmful to the health of people, they are certain to be devastating to the fate of the planet. The clamor for ketogenic diets is at odds with every trend necessary to preserve our aquifers, wild places, biodiversity, and climate. 
So, maybe a diet low in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts and seeds; a diet low in antioxidants and phytonutrients, and devoid of fiber- could be good for you in spite of it all. If you are reaching for your credit card accordingly, you should understand you are paying for the privilege of making a leap of faith. Time will tell about the landing.
As for those peddling the concept of ketogenic diets so absurdly beyond the basis for it in any evidence, there are only two explanations. Either they have drunk deeply of their own low-carb Kool-Aid, and are themselves deluded; or they are selling the stuff to you, but know not to buy it, in which case they are profiteering hypocrites. The expansive market for fatuous diets provides abundant cover for both species.
As I write this, the proposed “Guiding Principles” for healthy eating in Canada have just been released. They are eminently sensible, current, and evidence-based; so naturally, they are under immediate attack, as was the comparably sensible 2015 report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee here in the U.S. before ever its ink was dry. The beef and dairy industries oppose the movement toward more whole-food, plant-predominant diets so decisively associated with better health outcomes for people and planet alike. They would be more than glad to toast 2017 on its way with ketogenic Kool-Aid.
The likelihood, however, that they are toasting to your good health in 2018, let alone that of the planet, is very remote indeed. I do so, wishing you a happy New Year, and the boon of prudent choices.
-fin
Author disclosure statement: A recent, provocative article in JAMA called on all scholars addressing diet to disclose their own position, practice, and interests. Accordingly, I note that I am a life-long advocate of minimally processed, plant-predominant diets on the basis of relevant evidence I have reviewed directly. I practice such a diet personally. I do not have a financial interest in any specific kind of diet, but I do inevitably have a financial interest in advancing what I consider to be the truth about diet and health, since all of my professional activities are devoted to that mission.

Shortly after I started freelancing,2016-08-20,HALTH & WELLNESS,"I’ve always wanted to see South Africa’s majestic wildlife and to truly be one with nature. Shortly after I started freelancing for a safari tour operator, I seized the opportunity and asked my husband if we should go to South Africa next summer. His answer? “Why not?” I quickly booked the flight before he changed his mind and soon heard the African drum beats in my head.
The first person I told was my Mom since we both shared a love of animals. In fact, she was preparing to go on her own dream vacation: six weeks in Australia and New Zealand.
Two weeks after I booked my flight, my Mom told me that she had a tumor near the optic nerve of her left eye. She got approvals from two doctors to go on her trip before the surgery. Her priorities were set! So she went and had an incredible time.
I flew from Germany where I live to visit my Mom in Florida for 10 days. We wanted to see each other before her surgery, just in case.
Her surgery was then scheduled a week before my trip. Not the timing of my choice, but this wasn’t about me. I couldn’t blame her for wanting the tumor out immediately. I probably would have done the same thing. 
The night before her surgery, she told me that if anything happened, to have an incredible time in Africa. I just laughed it off and said, “I’m sure nothing will happen, Mom, you’ll do just fine.” But I wasn’t sure. I was scared.
We all held our breath that day. She pulled through and was released from the hospital three days later. However, I thought her discharge was too soon. It didn’t feel right, so I questioned it, but my Mom was an RN and she assured me she’d be OK. 
I talked to my Mom twice after her surgery. She had a very deep voice and sounded exhausted, but was OK. She mentioned that Gigi, their sweet dog, lied by her side and didn’t move an inch since she got home.
She also told me to have a great time in Africa and to send her photos. We both said “I love you” and “Goodbye.” 
My family and I arrived in Johannesburg on July 20. At around midnight that same night, the phone rang. My heart stopped when I saw that it was my mother’s husband. I knew he wasn’t calling to say hi. My Mom passed away two hours prior from a starburst blood clot which caused both a pulmonary embolism and a massive heart attack.
Reality didn’t set in that night, not even after Skyping with my sister. We were both in shock, but I had to make a decision. 
What should I do? I had two choices: Cancel our vacation and fly to Florida or continue with our trip as planned.
I remembered that my Mom told me to enjoy my trip, no matter what, but still, it didn’t feel right. How could I enjoy a vacation right after losing her? That’s impossible and just plain wrong! Right? On the other hand, I know how negatively she would react if I were to ignore her last wish.
I discussed it with my family and we decided that I should stay in Africa and fly to Florida later.
I felt guilty though. I felt guilty for not personally being there for my Mom’s husband. I felt guilty for not being with my sister. I felt guilty for not crying much. But I also feel that everyone has the right to mourn in his or her own way. I apparently don’t need tears. I need hugs. I need to write. I need comfort food. I need nature, animals and music. So maybe the best place for me to be was in Africa.
And guess what? My Mom was with me the entire time.
The first time I felt my Mom’s presence was in Balule Game Reserve near Kruger National Park on our sunset game drive. It was pitch black and then bam! There they were, a family of elephants, right in the middle of the rugged path. My heart stopped again. It was exactly 24 hours after Mom passed.
There was one female and four younger elephants of all different stages of life. Our guide said that the female adult was about to give birth any minute/day. I just kept whispering, “oh my God, oh my God” as tears swelled up in my eyes. It was one of the most magical moments I’ve ever experienced.
You never forget your first elephant sighting and I’m so glad Mom was with me for it.
Every time I saw something amazing, I thought ‘Wow, I can’t wait to tell Mom about this!’ Then I remembered and whispered, “damn.” This happened several times a day.
I’m still in denial.
I’ve realized though that it was a good thing that I stayed. It gave me the much needed peace and quiet time to think about my Mom, to feel numb, to stare off into space, and to lose a lot of sleep. I was also distracted by the wonders of nature and that, right there, brought me closer to her and I’m very grateful for that.
Now, here I sit, in a small, uncomfortable seat on the airplane taking me home. I’m a bit scared though. What if I don’t feel her presence anymore? How do I face reality and move on to the anger phase? Can I even skip the anger phase? How can I start working again tomorrow?
The fact is, death is a part of life and I have to deal with it, whether I want to or not, just like everyone else who has lost someone very special.
Being on vacation has helped me to begin the grieving process and I realized that’s exactly what I needed.
ps. Thank you, Mom, for accompanying me in Africa. I hope you too enjoyed our time together. I love you. God speed.

457,HEALTHY LIVING,The Pharma Industry Tried To Justify Drug Prices. We Fact Checked Them.,"Kaiser Health News, ContributorKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-pharma-industry-tried-to-justify-drug-prices-we-fact-checked-them_us_59ce9149e4b06791bb107e19,Drug companies are in the midst of a glossy publicity campaign to stop attempts to control rising pharma costs. But the devil is in the details.,2017-09-29,HALTH & WELLNESS,"By Jay Hancock | Kaiser Health News
Drug companies launched an ad and publicity extravaganza this year right after President-elect Donald Trump said they “are getting away with murder” on sky-high pill prices.
More than it has in years, the pharmaceutical industry fears major legislation that would curb prices and shrink profits. TV spots lauding drug companies, quoting poet Dylan Thomas and showing heroic scientists have been hard to escape.
But the narrative from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), a trade group, is only the rosiest, most self-serving version of the tale, say critics, and numerous independent authorities question its assertions.
They say the campaign is misleading in these five ways:
1. Lowballing drugs’ cost to society.
For years, PhRMA said retail prescription drugs account for only 10 percent of America’s enormous health care bill. Lately, the group has been using a figure of 14 percent, counting chemotherapy and other drugs delivered in hospitals and doctor offices.
Both numbers downplay the expense of prescription meds. Arriving at the industry’s estimates requires lumping drug costs in with billions in public health spending, such as checking water and animals for pathogens, as well as nursing home care and other categories only loosely connected to the day-to-day job of healing the sick.
Retail drugs alone were 21 percent of the cost in 2014 for employer-sponsored health plans, often exceeding costs for inpatient hospital treatment. Add chemotherapy and other non-pharmacy drugs, and the portion is higher.
At CareFirst, a BlueCross BlueShield plan with members in Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia, total drug costs when chemotherapy and other hospital-administered medicines were added became a thumping 34 percent of the expense in the first half of 2017, says CEO Chet Burrell. By contrast, inpatient care, traditionally the most expensive health service, is about 20 percent of CareFirst’s costs.
“That tells you about the power of what’s going on with the drug prices and the degree of use of the drugs,” Burrell said.
2. Exaggerating drug development costs.
Inventing, testing and launching a drug costs $2.6 billion, calculates the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development. The industry substantially finances the center’s work, leading many to question its credibility. Drug companies use its conclusions to justify high prices and cite this figure at every turn.
Outside authorities criticize the research, saying it comes from untestable data, ignores enormous tax subsidies that reduce costs and inflates results with imaginary expenses, such as profits that could have been earned if drug companies invested research dollars elsewhere.
“These estimates are all based on secret, unverifiable numbers of unknown reliability from unknown companies about unnamed drugs,” said Donald Light, a health policy professor at Rowan University in New Jersey.
The Tufts results line up with publicly available data, counters Joseph DiMasi, economic analysis director for the Tufts Center. “If anything, they suggest our estimates are conservative,” he said.
But an independent study published in September using public filings found the median cost of developing 10 cancer drugs was $648 million, while the median revenue per drug was $1.7 billion.
Light and other critics especially object to counting, as part of development costs, the theoretical profit firms might have earned if they put research money into something other than inventing drugs — such as buying extra ads for existing products. That adds more than $1 billion to the supposed cost.
What settles the argument is drugmakers’ audited financial statements, which show that costs of all kinds are far below what they collect in revenue. Ten of the top publicly traded U.S. drug companies earned profits of $83.6 billion last year on revenue of $306 billion, regulatory filings show. That’s a 27 percent pretax profit margin — accomplished even after spending billions on TV ads and salespeople.
3. Cheering too loudly about a slowdown in drug costs.
Fueled partly by hepatitis C medicine costing as much as $1,000 a pill, retail prescription drug spending soared by 12 percent in 2014 and another 9 percent in 2015, according to government data. That was the biggest two-year increase in a decade.
So it’s no surprise growth is reverting to the mean now that there are fewer new blockbusters. Government figures aren’t in yet for 2016. But QuintilesIMS, which tracks wholesaler sales, says drug spending grew 4.8 percent last year.
“The slowest rate in years,” brags PhRMA, quoting a magazine. Actually, drug-spending growth was even lower from 2010 to 2013 before roaring back.
In any case, 4.8 percent is still twice the inflation rate for 2016 and greater than economic growth, which determines what the country can afford over the long term.
New drugs arriving to market, often involving living cells and gene therapy, look more expensive than ever. The announced cost for Novartis’ Kymriah therapy for kids with leukemia is $475,000 for a one-time treatment.
Drug companies seem to show concern about high prices only when there’s a danger Congress might do something about them. In January, AbbVie loudly promised to keep price increases under 10 percent this year. Now that political pressure has subsided, company executives said recently they have more “flexibility” to revert “to double-digit increases in 2018 and beyond,” according to a Sept. 22 report from Leerink, an investment research firm.
AbbVie subsequently said Leerink “incorrectly characterized” the remarks. The drugmaker promised to make “one, single-digit price increase” for 2018.
4. Exaggerating the role of generics.  
“Nearly 90 percent of all medicines dispensed in the United States are generics,” says PhRMA, trying to argue drugs are cheap.
The group doesn’t mention that brand-name medicines are responsible for 74 percent of prescription costs and that drugmakers do everything in their legal power to keep pills from going generic after patents expire.
“PhRMA has fought for years to keep generics off the market,” said Robin Feldman, a law professor who researched the subject for a book, “Drug Wars,” published in June, which she co-authored. “The brunt of the pain of that is felt by U.S. citizens,” who pay more for medicine than anybody in the world, she said.
Industry tactics have included paying makers of generics not to make pills; filing dubious petitions opposing generics that cause months of delay; withholding samples that generics companies need to launch their own pills; and changing dosages or delivery mechanisms in tiny ways to get a new patent, Feldman said.
5. Exaggerating benefits from new drugs. 
“Since 2000, biopharmaceutical companies have brought more than 500 new medicines to U.S. patients, resulting in significant progress against some of the most costly and challenging diseases,” says one of PhRMA’s promotions.
Rather than being breakthroughs, however, too many new drugs are “me-too” substances based on previous research, critics say. Many aren’t demonstrably better than cheaper, already available drugs yet get heavily promoted through expensive ads and salespeople.
Bernard Munos worked for years at Eli Lilly and now is a consultant and sits on the board of several small, drug-related companies. He credits the industry with creating drugs that “are superb and make a difference,” such as Gleevec, Novartis’ blood-cancer drug.
But there are not nearly enough of them, he says.
“One of the challenges of the industry is that, despite all of its efforts, it has not been successful in producing more of the really transformative drugs,” he said. “Mediocre drugs are starting to price themselves at almost the same level as the really innovative drugs. And this is a market failure.”

459,HEALTHY LIVING,Food Marketing Matters,"Mike Sheridan, ContributorNutrition & Fitness Expert, and author of Eat Meat And Stop Jo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/food-marketing-matters_b_5534420.html,,2014-07-02,HALTH & WELLNESS,"Not only does the government refuse to adjust a ridiculous food pyramid that's left more than one-third obese and two-third overweight, but they fail to regulate marketing and advertising efforts that should be illegal. Aside from the fact that companies can put ""no trans fat"" on their products if they keep the level under 0.5 grams, cereal companies can partner with heart associations and add ""lowers cholesterol"" to their box, and corn starch-filled yogurt brands can creatively market a probiotic from rat feces. I'm referring to the lack of regulation of in-your-face advertising. I'm pretty sure you didn't want a donut when you woke up, or a bag of Doritos and a 2-liter cola when you walked into the grocery store. As much as corporations can claim that it's personal choice, it's clear that we are impacted by food advertising. 
With the addictive properties in wheat, fructose, and sugar, it's nearly as bad as waving a bag of crack in front of Tyrone Biggums!
Various research studies have shown that food cues activate reward centers in the brain. Unfortunately, these reward cues are heightened by the added sugars and sweeteners in the products that are heavily marketed to us. Researchers in France determined that the sweetness added to these foods surpasses cocaine reward and produces a dependency. 
Not only the ""Want,"" but the ""Want to Eat MORE."" 
The protein found in wheat is broken down into amino acids called polypeptides that are permitted access to our brains (pass the blood-brain barrier) and attach to morphine receptors. This produces a euphoric feeling when consumed, which makes us crave more in the future, and even eat more now. In one study, binge eaters were put in a room full of food and:
Those with the receptor blocked ate 28 percent less wheat containing snacks (pretzels, crackers, etc). 
In a similar study, individuals were given free reign to eat whatever they pleased in a cafeteria, and:
Those with the receptor blocked, ended up consuming one-third less food at lunch and one-fourth less food at dinner.
As I illustrated in an earlier post, fighting these food cues is even more difficult for individuals that are struggling with excess fat. It's not only harder for them to lose because of resistant cells and fat specific hormones, but they have less motivation to do so.
The government refuses to control our exposure to these distorted messages, yet they have no problem turning around and pointing the finger at us for being fat.
""It's your fault! You eat too much and don't exercise.""
Interestingly, when the food cues are positive, those attempting to shed the fat consistently make better food choices and are able to ignore junk food  and other snack foods successfully.
A recent study in the International Journal of Obesity found that:
Discretely giving obese individuals health primes before entering a grocery store reduced their snack purchases by 75 percent.
So it appears the marketing works both ways. Especially in those that are struggling to lose, who unfortunately are more affected  by these unregulated marketing messages. The question is, which cue will the consumer see?
If the government won't help, perhaps it's worth priming ourselves?
Surprisingly, those health and fitness magazines we all love to hate even improve our choices. Maybe it's time to put the magazine rack at the front of the store?
Without a doubt the pop and chips should be at the back. If it was up to me, they'd be in the garbage.

Without books I'm not sure I would have survived those first 18 years of my life. Literature was my medicine, my escape, and my rest, all through growing up. But never did it matter more than during those days with Anna Karenina.",2015-06-09,HALTH & WELLNESS,"Note: The contents of this post may be sensitive for some readers.

An autumn day, 19 years ago, I sat by the window watching a grove of majestic old poplars move in the wind. I had just turned 18. The poplars grew outside the hospital building, outside the psychiatric ward where I was locked up, against my will, because I was considered a danger to myself.   A suicide attempt brought me here. A carefully-planned attempt that averted from the script at the last moment. A mere coincidence ""wrecked"" the plan, although I no longer consider it a coincidence, no more than I consider the attempt failed. 
I sat by the window for hours, in silence, my gaze locked on the trees and their movements in the wind. The rustle of the leaves, the sturdy branches heaving. It was a windy day. 
The string used for hoisting the blinds was replaced with a crank. The wall sockets were secured. No mirror above the sink. Every tenth minute, 24 hours a day, someone opened the door and peeked in, to make sure I wasn't about to make a noose out of my bed sheets. 
They were overdoing it, the surveillance thing. 
It was over. I had tried, and now it was over. 
I wasn't dramatically inclined and had no plans for trying again. I had no plans at all. I had renounced everything, life and my place in it, when I made that decision, and now I was a woman without a future. It would take me many years to see the blessing in that. 
There and then it was no blessing. It was a vacuum. It was the end of a struggle that had lasted for so long I could no longer remember any other life. It was the emptiness that remained after all that I had been, believed in, and held on to had turned to dust. It was the wounds that had healed badly or not at all. The phantom pains after parts of me that had not survived, after a childhood in some ways lost, that I -- finally -- could no longer escape from. 
I was lonely the way I think a person is only in the face of her own death. 
In the cupboard next to my bed were a pile of clothes that someone -- Mom? I forget -- had brought. Next to them were two greasy paper bags, one with vanilla buns and one with arrack truffles. Someone who knew they were my favorites had sent them. I survived on those buns. If I wanted lunch and dinner I had to step outside my room and walk to the dining room, along with the others. I avoided that.
There's a reason this ward was locked. Many of those in here were... well, crazy. Simply. Like the woman who walked the corridors carrying a bucket, into which she regularly threw up. The one who howled through out the night. He who packed his suitcase every afternoon and sat by the exit waiting to be picked up, by God knows whom.   A few were there for other reasons. Like me. We never spoke but sometimes our eyes met in the corridors and a silent question was exchanged: You too?
On my night table I had a framed photo of my little brothers, only children back then, dressed in cowboy suits and serious faces. Beside them two books. A Farewell to Arms, by Hemingway, and Anna Karenina, by Tolstoy. After a few days I managed to turn my attention away from the trees and pick one of them up. I ploughed through Hemingway as efficiently as he writes. It left no impression. 
Then I opened Anna Karenina. 
It's a long read, and I was grateful for that. I rested in Tolstoy's words, the way I rested in the movement of the trees outside the window. It was not an escape from. On the contrary, it was close, so close. Naked. 
It was connection at a time when all connection had become impossible. 
Anna Karenina's downward tumble was in every way different from mine. Her circumstances as well. The only thing we had in common, really, was the name, and maybe a certain inability to follow the rules. (Maybe our humanity as well. And our vulnerability. And our desperate longing.)
She did not make it. Anna Karenina's path ended in a confused suicide. And however much I understood her feeling that there was no other way, I saw that she was wrong. 
(That I was wrong.) 
It didn't make anything easier. It didn't heal my wounds. But it was true, and true I could trust. Even lean against, ever so little. 

The power of the written word was not new to me. Without books I'm not sure I would have survived those first 18 years of my life. Literature was my medicine, my escape, and my rest, all through growing up. But never did it matter more than during those days with Anna Karenina.
My love of literature and of words has changed. I don't read like before. Don't read the same books. I love what I love more intensely and at the same time care less about the whole thing. About the business of books. About the books themselves, actually. 
Love the process. Love when writing becomes pure meditation. Love when the words come out just right. Those rare occasions when they help us connect. When your words become mine and mine become yours, and we are not alone anymore. 
I don't know what could ever be more important than that.

I do not believe that there is an end.",2014-11-16,HALTH & WELLNESS,"The story I told on stage regarding my addiction was the raw and honest truth. However, I feel that it might also give the perception that I am at the end of my difficult journey, and that I have successfully recovered. In my high school literature class, we learned about something called a ""hero's journey."" It is the story arc behind the majority of novels and movies, where the main character undergoes a death and rebirth, and then comes back home to safety and happiness. 
While I do believe that it is possible for individuals to go through a very difficult and transformational time of their lives and then re-emerge feeling stronger than ever before, I do not believe that the end feels like a safety net. I do not believe that there is an end. I simply believe that each and every one of us as humans are on a ""hero's journey,"" and we are simply at different parts of the journey. Looking at the chart below, I have decided that I am at the ""Threshold,"" the beginning of the transformation. I still have many challenges and temptations.

Let me put things into perspective. A week after I returned from giving my Ted talk in London, I relapsed. Yes, after I stood on stage telling everyone my story -- how much I had gone through, and how hopeful I was -- I gave in to my demons and relapsed. At that point I was receiving a large inbound of messages from everybody telling me how strong I was, how proud they were of me for sharing my story, for getting healthy. At one moment back home in San Francisco, I remember binging on food, while simultaneously writing a reply to a girl who had seen my speech in London and was asking for my advice on how to recover. Man, that was hard. My guilt and shame filled my entire body. ""How could I still be relapsing when I just gave this powerful talk which apparently gave the impression that I was recovered? How can I be giving recovery advice when I am still at the very beginning of my own recovery?"" 
And then I stopped and thought -- the point of my speech was simple. ""When you talk about your demons, they lose their power."" But when I got back home to San Francisco, I was doing the opposite of that. As I sat at home relapsing, I was hiding in a little cocoon behind my lonely computer screen, pretending to the world that I was doing great even though I clearly was not. The demons were quickly gaining power again. So I literally had to re-watch my own speech, get inspired by my own advice, and get back on track. It's funny how your brain can have two sides -- one so seemingly rational and astute, and the other a mess of distress. I seem to tether back and forth between the two -- the anxious and confused brain constantly having to refer back to the rational brain to see what needs to be done. So what did I do? I reached out, spoke to my friends and my ""mentors"" as they call them in the Hero's Journey, and the demons lost their power once again. I got right back on track. 
Now I do have some advice: Once you get back on track, when your rational mind is at its strongest, it is important to figure out what exactly brought you to your point of relapse, and then find tangible solutions to avoid these triggers. You can't simply leave it up to fate that these demons will not appear again in maybe a few days, a week, a month. You absolutely need a solution. Maybe the solution that you come up with will not be the right one, and maybe you will relapse again, but it is obvious after a relapse that something needs to change. For me, what did I realize? I realized that being a violinist is a wonderful job to have, but also a very lonely job, and for an addict isolation is the greatest cause of a relapse. I realized that I have many other passions that are equal if not greater than music, and I do not need to choose one or the other. Therefore, in addition to my violin gigs, I will begin a career where I can be constantly surrounded with friends and colleagues. 
I am nothing short of excited for my future right now. I know that the journey ahead of me is going to be tough. I will probably have hundreds of ""revelations"" on my hero's journey, and hopefully I can write about all of them. After writing this blog post, my very first published post on the internet, I actually feel some sense of relief and contentment. I feel as if I have released many of my demons just by writing about it and knowing that it will be read. Hmmm... Solution #2 for my recovery: Continue these blog posts!

Every milestone a celebration no matter how big or small. Sometimes it is a step forward and then a few back but as long as we keep moving forward with good days it is ok.,2015-05-06,HALTH & WELLNESS,"I saw my eight month old son crawl for the first time today. I will never see my four-year-old daughter crawl. I watched as my baby boy over a series of weeks started moving. He would appear in places I had not left him. Then he was off, exploring his world eating dust, pulling books out of the book case and being an explorer. I would turn around and I would have a follower. 
I never thought I would have the chance to see what it is like to see a child grow healthy and strong without medical intervention. It is a beautiful experience. It is so easy to compare milestones when your child doesn't reach them. So for now, and this moment of beauty, I have chosen to make my own.   I have learned every moment is a gift. Every milestone a celebration no matter how big or small. Sometimes it is a step forward and then a few back but as long as we keep moving forward with good days it is ok. I cling to the good and positive aspects of my life. When I heard my daughter sing for the first time or when she learns a new sound or word it is a delight to my ears. She can't as yet, move from place to place without my husband or me carrying her but something she is really good at, is encouraging. I can be mowing, gardening or cleaning and she will sit in her stroller cheering, and encouraging me on. Her arms rise up celebrating me pulling a weed or she'll say 'ha ha' at something silly and make me laugh at myself. When I stop she wants me to hurry up and celebrates when I begin again. Or perhaps she is just being pushy but she cheers with a smile and always a giggle. I love seeing her happy. There has been many times when she has been sad from pain or an infection so happiness is embraced.  A few weeks ago I watched for the very first time as she test drove a power wheel chair. There was a joy on her face I have never seen. It looked like happiness and freedom. This is her 'crawling' and exploring. This is her moment to touch, feel and engage with her surroundings. It has just taken her longer. Hesitantly at first, she pushed the joy stick on the power wheel chair and then she was off. Her world opened up and she can be free and independent. I am so proud of her for coming so far and taking another chance to learn she can do more.
It is easier for her to become frustrated when she tries and tries and takes longer to succeed. Now, she replays the movie of herself on her iPad and asks for the power wheel chair. The end of each movie celebrated with a hooray. When we are out and she sees another child with a wheel chair she points and wants to have a try. I can't imagine her frustration of wanting to explore her world and just not being able too.  One day soon I hope she will have the chance to move where she wants. She will learn for herself what it is like to be free instead of her screaming and waving her hands around because we don't know where she wants to go. She becomes so frustrated being carried around. 
One day soon in a power wheel chair she can, for the first time in her life make a choice of where to play and who to talk too. Maybe she'll zoom away from me at last having her space and freedom of being who she wants and not being constrained by adults. I might even find her pulling books off the book case or eating dust, who knows but I can't wait. One day soon I'll see my four-year-old 'crawl in her power wheel chair'.

But I believe that there are 10 conversations that every couple needs to have on a regular basis in order to keep their emotional connection alive. They can help you realize what areas of their relationship may need to be worked on, whether this is done with more conversation or even with a couples counselor. In 2015, why not commit to having at least a few of these helpful conversations?
By the way, if you want to know when you would use these questions, a good thing to do is an Emotional Check In, which is a weekly time (yes, put it on your Outlook) that you and your spouse sit together for a a half hour, no more and no less, to discuss only how the relationship is going. Many couples find this to be useful; it isn't such a long time that the less emotionally expressive partner is terrified, and it is long enough for both people to feel heard. So try a weekly Emotional Check In, and use some of these questions during it. (Note: If you're a devoted reader of this blog, you'll realize that many of these are questions I use in my Functional Couple Fridays interviews. So I walk the walk.)
 We otter ask each other some of these questions
1. What do you love about me? This question is wonderful to use on a regular basis. It makes partners feel great to know that there are specific things about them that are valued and appreciated within their relationship. Talking about this can bring partners back to the honeymoon stage, where all you ever did was talk about what you love about each other (and have sex). This conversation topic pumps out endorphins and makes both partners happy.
2. What do I do regularly that makes you happy? Not only does this give you the happiness benefits of having your effort noticed and recognized, but it can also be instructive to learn exactly what does and doesn't resonate emotionally with your partner. For example, if you're busting your butt to get a delicious dinner on the table every night for your husband, but he never mentions this as something that makes him happy, maybe you can relax and order take out sometimes. This can also lead into a productive discussion about love languages.
3. What is your favorite time we had together this week? Note I didn't say this month or today. A week is a good unit because you can remember most things easily, but some days are going to go by in a normal relationship without many good things happening. If you can't think of any favorite time within seven days, that's an indicator that you need to make more time as a couple, or that there are underlying issues with the relationship. And reminiscing about good times together, even as recently as that morning or a week ago, builds feelings of intimacy and closeness.
4. What are you looking forward to doing together as a couple? Looking forward to events can be even more enjoyable than the events themselves, according to research. So, figure out what you're looking forward to, whether it's tonight, next week, this summer, or as retirees. Or all of those! Talking about your plans together makes you feel like a team, and gives you positive thoughts to help you through tougher times in the relationship.
5. When did you first realize you loved me? Another romantic one that brings you back to the hormone- and endorphin-fueled stages of early love. These sorts of questions make people feel vulnerable and closely connected.
6. What do you think about our sex life? This should be a frank and honest discussion, where both partners try their hardest to be non-defensive and non-judgmental. If it was 20 years from now, wouldn't you wish you had this open discussion today? People have no idea what their partner wants if their partner won't tell them outright. I have treated couples where a man learned that a wife of decades never enjoyed or orgasmed from things he had been doing every time they had sex. Don't let this be you.
7. What do you think we have in common? This discussion builds closeness and a team feeling. Opposites don't actually attract; in most basic ways, couples that succeed are fairly similar. Elaborate on the ways that you have similar thoughts, feelings, goals, values, and interests. This will emphasize that you're a unit, and reaffirm your choice in partner.
8. Which of our differences do you think complement each other? In attachment theory, we've seen that avoidant partners often pair with preoccupied partners. Similarly, assertive partners often pair with passive ones. There are many ways in which two people with the exact same personality traits wouldn't work. One is often more laid back, one more responsible, one more intellectual, one more emotional, and so forth. This conversation helps you learn more about your partner, as well as realize why it may not be a bad thing that your partner is different than you. (Would you want to date you? Really? Completely?)
9. Do you trust me? Many if not most couples have issues in their history that makes them wary of fully trusting the other, whether this is something huge like infidelity, or something like a partner picking their parent over you during arguments. Trust needs to be discussed, and each partner needs to make a good faith effort to repair trust that has been broken. Often, this can be done with a couples counselor, if open discussion does not work.
10. What concrete things could I do to make you happier? This should be one to three things that a partner could reasonably do on a daily or monthly basis that would genuinely increase the other partner's quality of life. Having more sex, cleaning or doing some chore on your wife's timeline and specifications, scheduling more date nights, getting up with the kids, whatever. Be open to trying new things with the goal of enriching your marriage and making your partner feel valued and cherished.
Hopefully those questions can make it into your conversation tonight. Let me know how it goes, and share if you found this useful! Till we meet again, I remain, The Blogapist Who Wants Your Marriage To Be Awesome.

Yes, it's a bit more intimate, vulnerable and unpredictable, but it's also a lot more real.",2015-02-04,HALTH & WELLNESS,"Texting is the lazy way to connect. We're all living fast and busy lives. We all want short cuts and quick fixes, but one place to take it slow is with communication.
How many of you have had these text message exchanges?
""Hey Julie, how you doing?""
""I'm doing good! How about u?""
""Things are good.""
""Cool! So glad to hear.""
For me, that's a wasted conversation. Sure, it's good to know that their friend is alive and doing okay -- and of course, I'm sure that's not how they talk when they are together in person.
I'm guilty of these text conversations myself. I call them parking meter conversations. I don't really want to have a full-on conversation, but I want to keep the connection alive somehow. Perhaps it's even a woman I like, but not that much, so I don't want to cut all ties with her. So I put another ""coin"" the in meter of the relationship by sending a quick text check-in and hope that the other person doesn't come back with anything more than ""I'm good. You?""
Your Words Are Almost Meaningless 
Communication isn't just words on a screen. When you send a text message, you're missing other key elements of human interaction. Your voice tone, your body language, the context of conversation. A text message, even with your most enthusiastic emoticons, is only getting part of your message across.
No wonder we've all had those text message misunderstandings that make us look we're stuck in a Three's Company episode and Mister Roper is knocking on the door. 
But these days text messaging is so easy to do. It has so many benefits. 
You can still communicate in places where you can't or don't want to talk (doctor's office, libary, loud concert). You often get notifications (e.g. iMessage, What'sApp) that your message was delivered to their phone. You don't get that with a voicemail or missed call. You get to take your time and spend minutes or hours carefully crafting the perfect reply. Or the most flirty, but not too eager, invitation. You get to avoid being caught off guard if someone asks you a vulnerable question.
But those benefits also come with several drawbacks.
You don't know what state of emotion the person was in when they received your message, and therefore how they interpreted it. You don't know if they actually read your message. It's often difficult to tell when someone is being sarcastic or passive-aggressive. You can get disassociated from the connection and forget that there is another human being on the other side of that conversation thread. Your ego can start to take over.
Ok, so given those nuances, how do we know when to text and when to call?
When to send a text message: 
You want to say a light compliment. You're coordinating logistics (when and where to meet or you are running late). You want to share a photo you just took. You or the other person is in a place where they can't talk on the phone.
When to call them on the phone or video chat: 
You're sad or angry and want to talk about it with them. You want to express your love and appreciation for them. You miss them. (Just call them first, don't wait for them to take the lead.) You need to have a serious conversation. Whatever you need to say can be wrapped up in a two-minute conversation rather than a 20-minute back-and-forth text exchange. 
I think one trend in our society today is the phenomenon of the ""appointment"" culture. We no longer feel like we can just call someone. We need to set up a specific day and time to chat. We presume that everyone is busy and feel like we're interrupting them when we call them. 
Yet the truth is no one is obligated to pick up the phone just because someone is calling them. We all know by now how to send the call to voicemail or put our phones on silent mode. 
You want to call, then call. If that's still not your vibe, then text them to set up a time to call.
I will say that asking someone out on a date directly over the phone is a hell of a lot more ballsy than sending a text that says ""Hey, you wanna hang out sometime?""
This isn't some moral diatribe on what is the right way to communicate, but it is an invitation to be a little bolder.
Stop hiding behind typing on a screen and reach out more to the people you call your friends and lovers.
Yes, it's a bit more intimate, vulnerable and unpredictable, but it's also a lot more real.

The pizzas were labeled as containing ""uncured beef pepperoni,"" but in actuality, the pepperoni was uncured pork. Some people have an allergic sensitivity to pork, while others consciously exclude the meat from their diets for religious, cultural or other reasons. 
Whole Foods retail shops in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island carried the mislabeled pizzas, which were made between Jan. 5 and Jan. 22, 2016. The following two products were recalled:
 10-oz. vacuum-sealed packages of “WHOLE FOODS MARKETS, PIZZA, PEPPERONI, 8” 19-oz. vacuum-sealed packages of “WHOLE FOODS MARKETS, PIZZA, PEPPERONI, 12” 
The recalled pizzas are marked with establishment number “EST. 20234” and have sell-by dates of Jan. 12, 2015 through Jan. 30, 2016. See photos of the pizza labels at FSIS.gov.
While there haven't been any reports of negative reactions to the products, the FSIS urges consumers to throw away the products or return them to Whole Foods. If you are concerned about an illness associated with consumption of the pizzas, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

Jonna Roslund, a 26-year-old woman from Sweden, posted two photos on the social sharing site Imgur that perfectly capture this truth. Roslund shared two images of her bedroom ― before she cleaned it and after ― to celebrate how meaningful it was that she found the strength to accomplish a chore. 
“I suffer from severe depression and have a really hard time with cleaning and doing other kinds of household work,” she wrote in the caption. “My room have been this messy for several months because I can’t push myself to take care of it. But this Friday I decided to finally do it!”
(Click through the album to see the photos. Story continues below the images.)
In addition to a lack of motivation, depression also can result in sleep loss, changes in appetite, headaches and more.
“When you’re depressed, it’s a struggle to just get out of bed,” Roslund told Upworthy. “It makes other things that other, healthy people do, so overwhelming. It’s like trying to run a marathon when you’ve been in a coma for years.”
Despite this, there’s still a large stigma surrounding depression, which can prevent individuals living with the condition from seeking professional support. Many people who don’t understand the disorder often equate it with “feeling sad” and something a person can just “get over.”
Roslund’s post is proof that depression is anything but these misconceptions. And, even further, the photos are also the perfect example that success in treating depression can be in the little victories, too.

You deserve that.,2015-01-29,HALTH & WELLNESS,"Something really heartbreaking happened this past Saturday.
A lot of people were hitting the beach with friends and family (yes, it was warm where I live) and I, of course, was happy to join them.
I found myself sitting next to a family, and the mom was obviously embarrassed to take off her clothes and be seen in her bathing suit. Her family was in the water playing games, yet she remained covered in her baggy clothes, even in the scorching hot temperatures.
She caught my attention because I used to be the same way, and my heart broke for her. It's painful to live in shame about who you are. I watched as so many lost moments went by that she didn't engage with her family, missing out on creating really great memories.
When I learned strategies to let go of shame, guilt, and self-loathing, my entire life changed. I made better choices with my food, found pleasure in moving my body, deepened my relationships, even created more rewarding job opportunities that I never thought were possible for me before.
You can have this, too!
I want you to feel great in a bathing suit and never worry what others think of you again. I want you to have a deep level of self-respect and self-love, in a way that you've never known before. I want you to look and feel amazing, simply because you're a radiant human being.
The thing I've learned about weight is that it's never really about the weight. The weight is only a symptom to something deeper going on inside. The challenge for most people is discovering what that something is.
Getting to the root of your weight issue will begin your healing process to total body freedom forever. You deserve that.
Even if you have tried a thousand times to lose weight, or you feel it will never work for you, or you believe you've messed up your metabolism, it's time to unveil what's really happening and put an end to it once and for all, so you can live a happy life!
Three Tips To Discover What Your Weight Is Trying To Tell You:
1. Slow down and listen: It's time for you to slow down, my friend, and learn the skill of listening to your body, heart, and soul and actually hearing what they really want. I don't want you to just listen, I want you to also take action. Clear your schedule of things that you aren't passionate about, take time to yourself every day (you can start with five to 10 minutes) to get in touch with you, schedule in you time on your calendar and treat it like an appointment with someone you would never flake on.
2. Master your emotions:If you're turning to food to check out from your feelings (stress, anxiety, sadness, grief, frustration, resentment) then there is most likely some extra weight due to this. Mastering your emotions means that no matter what life throws at you (divorce, bankruptcy, death of a loved one), you are able to stay in control and empowered and not get thrown into the bag of cookies to numb out to what you're feeling. This is a crucial skill to master for long term results with your weight loss.
3. Keep your eye on the goal:You're going to have some growing pains as you get to the root of what's behind your weight. Be kind to yourself and stay consistent. It's very easy to get sidetracked when the going gets tough. Don't let it happen to you again! This time make sure you have a support group around you, find a mentor, get your cheerleaders and accountability partners in place, keep your eye on your goal, buckle down and do it. You can not waste another day of your precious life being overweight and unhappy. It's not how you want to live!
I know you can do this, be kind and nurturing with yourself as you discover the underlying cause of your weight, it will lead you to real freedom.
I believe in you.
All my love, Kerry

This is awesome, and pots of gold are too. But the problem with only focusing on having that pot of gold is that you completely miss the rainbow you followed to get there.
Not only did you miss the rainbow -- aka, the journey, once you've gotten your pot of gold, then what?
On to the next pot I guess. Only this time, it needs to be a bigger pot, a shiner pot, in order for you to feel as fulfilled as you did when you got that first pot of gold. A bigger goal to satisfy your inner goal junkie.
As cool as this would be to actually have pots of gold, does this actually make us happy? Would it really create a sense of purpose and fulfillment? We only need to look at Hollywood's rich and famous to know that an abundance of wealth (even when coupled with an abundance of adoring fans) is no guarantee for happiness.
Of course, being poor doesn't make you happy either, but the point here isn't to talk about having a real pot of gold, it's simply a metaphor for reaching whatever goal we are striving to achieve.
But here's the thing: We dream about having that pot of gold, being in that dream job or having that ideal relationship, because of how we think we will FEEL as a result of having that thing or living that life.
Yet have you ever reached a goal and felt great for a few days, maybe even a few weeks, but sooner or later you end up feeling a little empty, or lacking direction?
This is probably due to one of two reasons; your focus was all about reaching the end game, not about the journey you took to achieve your goal, and secondly, you didn't actually want the goal itself, you wanted the lifestyle, or more accurately, you wanted the feelings that you thought would come with having that goal.
In other words, you were looking for something external, be it a bank balance, a spouse, or a championship title, to feel fulfilled. But of course, true happiness and fulfillment can never come from something outside of you. It has to come from within.
So what does this mean? How can we leverage this insight to create goals that serve us in more than just a superficial way? How can we set goals that allow us to know ourselves more intimately and to create a deeper sense of personal fulfillment and satisfaction?
I'm going to use my recent goal of wanting to become a boxing champ to illustrate.
On the surface, this boxing goal looks like it's purely ego driven- a need to be the best. It is a goal fueled by competition, comparing myself to all the other females in my weight division and working to be better than them. Not just to be good, but the best. That's all ego, right? To dominate. To compare. To conquer.
Whilst that is the end goal, it's actually THE JOURNEY that I'm most interested in.
What type of person must I become in order to become the best? What new skills must I develop? What dedication and commitment must I display, ongoing, to transition from crap to being able to master the techniques I need? What fears must I overcome? What new depths of courage must I reach? What doubts must I learn to silence? What beliefs must I instill within my heart and at my very core?
This process is the real reward. The boxing title, if it comes, will simply be confirmation that I have reached these stepping stones along the journey.
The determination, the wanting, the chasing, the learning, the growing, the pushing, the doubting, the believing, the training, the sweating, the burning, the yearning, the friendships forged, the battles fought, the sacrifices made. The daring to want. The knowing of self. These are the real rewards.
When you know this to be true, the rainbow is no longer the means to an end. Instead, the rainbow becomes your pot of gold. And you can revel in that rainbow, every step of the way.
The pot of gold at the end is just a bonus.

475,HEALTHY LIVING,Why More Employers Are Giving Their Employees Fitness Trackers,Leigh Weingus,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/employers-fitness-trackers_us_55cb8d27e4b0f1cbf1e72204,"Less sick days, more productivity.",2015-08-17,HALTH & WELLNESS,"In 2013, 2,000 firms gave employees fitness trackers, according to BBC. In 2014, that number went up to 10,000.
The oil and gas company BP has given out over 24,000 fitness trackers to its staff, and participants are given fitness goals of one, two or three million steps each year. And by 2016, the U.S. software firm Autodesk -- another firm participating in a health challenge, according to BBC -- predicts that most large companies will be giving out fitness trackers.
So, what's going on?
Of course companies want their employees to be healthy, but they also have another incentive: a healthy staff means fewer sick days and increased productivity.
 ""A habit of regular exercise will help keep you mentally sharper throughout your entire life,"" Robert Pozen, a Harvard professor and author of  Extreme Productivity wrote in a Huffington Post blog, adding, ""People who exercise might have more brain cells than their more sedentary peers -- giving them a major advantage in the workplace.""
As for cutting down on sick days? One study found that people who participated in a daily exercise regimen saw a 40 to 50 precent reduction in respiratory infections, according to Breaking Muscle. 
Another interesting point the BBC makes, and something anyone using a company-distributed activity tracker should be aware of, is that it strips employees of some privacy. Although both BP and Autodesk told BBC that they only have access to aggregated data -- meaning they don't have information on individual activity -- it's still worth noting.

Here Are 2 Easy Ways!,"Douglas LaBier, ContributorBusiness psychologist, psychotherapist & writer; director, Cen...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/want-to-harm-your-relatio_b_6670390.html,"Relationships suffer from any kind of hidden communications. Countless couples become entrenched in patterns that steadily erode and undermine their mutual understanding, respect and prospects for sustaining intimacy. This research adds credence to the damage and suffering that results.",2015-02-13,HALTH & WELLNESS," Throughout the years I've worked a great deal with individuals and couples in psychotherapy who've become masters at damaging their relationships. They do so in a number of ways, but two, in particular, are most effective. They engage in a kind of dance: 
One partner withdraws, emotionally, when confronting differences or conflicts, and then hunkers down, waiting -- or hoping -- for the conflict to go away, somehow. The other partner conveys his or her desires or feelings by, well... saying nothing. The magical thinking, here, is that the partner will, of course, know how to mind-read, and then respond accordingly, as one hopes and expects.
It's classic -- and you can almost hear a Strauss waltz playing as the couple does this little dance together. It's very familiar in psychotherapy, and now some empirical research has honed in on this pattern. It shows the different ways in which both withdrawal and mind-reading harm relationships; with different degrees of harmful consequences. The findings highlight, in my view, the importance of practicing greater transparency throughout one's relationship - ""radical transparency,"" as I've called it in this previous post -- as scary as that can feel at the outset.
The research, conducted at Baylor University, examined these two patterns and demonstrated how they are harmful in different ways, and for different reasons. ""Withdrawal is the most problematic for relationships,"" said researcher Keith Sanford. ""It's a defensive tactic that people use when they feel they are being attacked, and there's a direct association between withdrawal and lower satisfaction overall with the relationship."" And, ""Expecting your partner to be a mind-reader"" -- which often reflects feeling anxious in the relationship -- ""...makes it especially difficult for couples to make progress toward resolving conflicts.""
The study was published in Psychological Assessment, and is described in detail in this report from Baylor. It concluded that that withdrawal doesn't necessarily influence whether a couple can resolve their conflict, but expecting or hoping the other person will be a mind reader ""has a direct influence on the couple's ability to settle the issue.""
The researchers found that withdrawing from a partner's criticism or complaint can reflect feeling threatened, and is ""more characteristic of unhappiness...you see more of that in distressed relationships."" Those who expect a partner to know what's wrong without being told tend to feel anxious and neglected; vulnerable, rather than threatened. Conflicts in which one partner expects the other to mind-read were more likely to lead to negative communication and anger.
Either way, relationships suffer from any kind of hidden communications. Countless couples become entrenched in patterns that steadily erode and undermine their mutual understanding, respect and prospects for sustaining intimacy. This research adds credence to the damage and suffering that results.

Have you found where you feel a sense of belonging -- among a group of people who understand you? Belonging and interacting is a very integral piece to your quality of life and to your health. A few weeks ago, I returned from an incredible weekend of sister- and brother-hood among my ""family"" at our alma mater, New York Military Academy (NYMA). It had been about 25 years since I had seen most of them. When we arrived at alumni weekend and reunited, it was as if no time had passed as we instantly fell back into sync with one another. Looking around the room all I saw were happy faces bonding and reminiscing with their fellow former classmates. It did not matter whether or not we had been in the same circles because we shared a common experience boarding at a military academy. During the weekend, I spent 27 hours laughing, bonding, and catching up with old friends, all of whom I consider family. It is those types of relationships that feed our souls and bring in health.
When Dan Buettner, author of The Blue Zones -- Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest, went around the world searching for areas that had the highest concentration of centenarians, those 100 years old and older, he would ask the centenarians what the secret was to their longevity and they would tell him that socialization was very important to them. When he spoke with Robert Kane, director of the Center on Aging and the Minnesota Geriatric Education Center at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Robert said:
There are some things I'd certainly recommend for what people would call successful aging. One of them is, in fact, to have a sense of social connectedness. Most people enjoy the company of other people, particularly other people who they feel care about them. That seems to give you a sense of well-being, whether that raises your endorphin level or lowers your cortisol level. 
Laughter is so important for cardiovascular health because it reduces stress. When Dan visited the people of Okinawa, he met a group of women who had a moai, loosely translated as ""meeting for a common purpose"" who met regularly to talk, laugh and to support each other. One woman he spoke with said, ""It's much easier to go through life knowing there is a safety net."" Dan writes that, ""On average, an American has only two close friends he or she can count on, recently down from three, which may contribute to an increasing sense of stress."" By contrast, these Okinawan women live almost 8 percent longer than their American counterparts. Why? Because every afternoon, when they get together, they shed all the chronic stress in their lives with each other. 

New York Military Academy was our moai. Cadets entered anywhere from 5th to 12th grade. Imagine living with your friends day in and day out? You do most things together, and you spend time building shared memories. I spent five years with these people, and we had seen each other at our highs and at our lows and shared a common experience that no one outside of our group could relate to or understand. It is through these lifelong bonds that we have a sense of belonging -- of camaraderie -- that makes our stress levels go down, but it is also without these people that we feel sad.
With technology, isolation is becoming more and more prevalent. People are spending more time texting and communicating via electronic devices than meeting in person with their friends. Additionally, if you go to any bar or restaurant, you will see more people engaging on their phones than with each other. Yet I hear every day how lonely and disconnected people are feeling. Just like you, others want to feel heard and to feel special. There is nothing worse than sitting with a friend telling a story while your friend is texting with someone else or more interested in the Facebook feed than in you.   Here are some tips for connecting with others:
Leave the cell phone in your car's glove compartment or turn it off for an hour or two and really connect with the person from whom you are sitting across. I promise there is nothing that important on your phone that won't hold for an hour or so.
Schedule time to meet with your friends. Remember the ladies of Sex in the City? I think women everywhere wished they had great girlfriends as those characters were to each other. You can too, but it requires you to nurture those relationships. Try to coordinate a regular meeting date and time for you and your friends to connect and have some fun together.
Go on Meetup.com and find a group that interests you. If you do not see a group that speaks to your interests, start one! Some of my good friends are people I have met through Meetup groups.
Reach out to a friend or family member you have not spoken to in a while. My cousin and I reconnected a few years back and got to know each other as adults. As a result, we have become very close and we talk very often and laugh and cry together.
There is more to life than technology. Go out there and reconnect with people. Join a sports league or travel group.
Finding your moai will do wonders for your health and your spirits. Go forth and find and connect with your ""moai,"" your ""NYMA,"" your ""family.""

478,HEALTHY LIVING,"As I Grieve, 'Maybe' Has Become A Positive Tool To Help Me Find Balance","Laurie Burrows Grad, ContributorGrief Blogger, Huffington Post Editor-in-Chief of www.epicurus...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/call-me-maybe-can-i-really-be-quoting-carly-rae-jepsen_us_596bcc83e4b022bb9372b2b8,"When you are in the process of grieving a loss of any kind, you must avoid looking ahead into the future. You are so devastated",2017-07-16,HALTH & WELLNESS,"When you are in the process of grieving a loss of any kind, you must avoid looking ahead into the future. You are so devastated by the loss that you cannot envision the life that might have been. Your future memories with your loved one are over, and you must find your way via the path of the present, in order to venture forward. Your need for the terra firma of certitude, clouds your thinking, and your focus must be myopically limited to the now.
I proffer that the use of the word maybe might be of help. The word maybe appeared between 1375 and 1425, derived from the late Middle English phrase “may be.” It means possibly or perhaps. Maybe is the bridge between despair and hope. When you are in the midst of a journey through grief, if you look to the future, you might say “I will be alone forever,” or “how will I get through this?” But if you were to say “maybe things might not be so bad,” you can open a world of possible options that are more hopeful. The negative attitude in your head might be transformed so that you can now observe what lies ahead as: “maybe I will be ok,” or “maybe if I go through this process, I will find joy again.” Instead of being mired in unnecessary angst over what could happen, if you say “maybe,” you can see a glimmer of hope on the horizon. Maybe opens one up to the possibility of change as an adventure, rather than a fearful endeavor. Maybe is the link from being afraid and stuck with the endless unconstructive internal dialogue swirling in your head, to the path that is open and full of potentially happy possibilities.
I like using the word maybe, which affords me the time to regroup and think if I really want to accept an invitation. When in grief, you have to be able to take care of yourself. Sometimes, a direct no, is a bit harsh. Maybe makes it easier to hit the pause button and think. When I am asked if I want to go to attend an event, I might say “maybe if I can work out the timing.” By using maybe as a breathing space, I can take the time to asses if I really want to attend or not. I also use maybe as a tool instead of fretting over the minutiae of life. If I am worrying over a doctor’s appointment or even something as mundane as “what if the traffic is bad,” I try to turn my worry upside down and say, “maybe, I will sail straight through on the 405 freeway today?” Maybe can be a meditative technique to find positivity in stress.
Maybe can also have a negative connotation as when we asked our parents if we could go for ice cream and they said “maybe,” meaning, not a shot! There are the musings and wonderings around the word maybe, such as If Sonny Corleone had used easy pass, maybe he would still be alive? When you are at the doctor’s office and you might ask, “will it hurt?” He or she might answer maybe. Ouch!
I am going to adopt maybe as a positive tool to help me find balance in my life. If I start to get obsessed with thoughts of sadness, I will try to breathe and remember maybe, and the hope it engenders in me. Maybe gives me the wherewithal to step back and be kind to others. Being immersed in maybe, I can see hope, or at least, I can see a light to guide me through the rest of my journey of grief. Maybe it won’t work out? But, knowing that the ride will be interesting and transformative, boosts my confidence and optimism.

479,HEALTHY LIVING,4 Uncommon But Serious Ear Infection Complications,"Deborah M. Burton, MD, ContributorPhysician, Mother, Blogger",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/4-uncommon-but-serious-ear-infection-complications_us_58a0e512e4b0cd37efcfea29,Ear infection complications can happen when the infections become severe or recurrent. I already discussed common myths about,2017-02-12,HALTH & WELLNESS,"Ear infection complications can happen when the infections become severe or recurrent. I already discussed common myths about ear infections and shared ear infection facts that I believe parents should know.
Ear infection complications can be divided into the common and the uncommon types.
Common ear infection complications include temporary hearing loss, speech delay, dizziness, balance problems and sensory processing and learning disorders.
Uncommon ear infection complications happen because of long term problems that have not been successfully treated or where symptoms seemed to go away. Without significant symptoms, it can be hard to know if a more serious problem is developing.
When kids suffer from ear infections for many years, they get used to ear symptoms and stop complaining about them. Kids are tough! They often say: It’s not bad, and I can handle it.
You do not want your child to “handle” ear problems. If your child’s ear infections do not happen as often as they used to, you need to understand that the ear problems should completely go away.
If ear infections keep happening, annual ear exams and hearing tests with an Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) doctor allows for better evaluations.
Although these problems are not common, children (and adults!) with chronic ear infections may develop one or more of these severe ear infection complications.
1. Chronic hearing loss
I am not talking about the temporary hearing loss that is caused by fluid buildup or swelling behind the ear drum that happens with routine ear infections.
A persistent hearing loss may happen because of scarring on the ear drum, or scar tissue that builds up around the tiny hearing bones of the ear.
This type of hearing loss is called a conductive hearing loss because sound has trouble reaching the hearing nerve.
Conductive hearing loss can be treated with surgery or hearing aids.
2. Ear drum perforation (hole in ear drum)
Again, I am not talking about a tiny hole that happens when an ear drum ruptures during a new ear infection. After an ear infection is treated, most ear drum ruptures completely heal.
Chronic ear drum perforations become more serious problems when they fail to close up. The perforation may become large enough that the ear drum cannot move correctly.
Ear drum movement improves the way sound reaches the hearing nerve. So, a large hole in the ear drum becomes another cause of the conductive hearing loss discussed above.
Ongoing ear infections cause repeated episodes of ear drainage through an ear drum perforation.
Chronic ear drum perforations are treated by repairing the hole with surgery.
3. Mastoiditis (MASS-stoid-EYE-tuss)
The mastoid bone, which sits behind the ear, is made of air spaces that help drain the middle ear fluid. When the mastoid cells become infected or inflamed, mastoiditis develops.
During new painful ear infections, acute mastoiditis may occur. Swelling on the bone behind the ear may indicate an emergency where hospitalization and IV antibiotics are needed. Other treatments include emergency ear drainage and possible removal of infected bone
Chronic mastoiditis is more difficult to diagnose because swelling slowly develops and ear pain is often not present. The trapped infection leads to severe complications because bone is slowly destroyed.
The mastoid bone separates the ear from the brain. When bone erosion happens, chronic middle ear infections can spread causing meningitis or a brain abscess.
Chronic mastoiditis requires surgical treatment.
4. Cholesteatoma (KO-less-TEA-uh-TOE-muh)
A cholesteatoma is a collection of skin cells inside the middle ear that can happen because of recurring ear infections.
If it is not treated, a cholesteatoma can eventually damage many structures deep inside the ear.
Symptoms of cholesteatoma can be similar to some of the other complications discussed. If there is a chronic ear drum perforation with recurrent ear drainage and hearing loss, a cholesteatoma may be present.
In addition to slowly eroding the hearing bones and bones near the brain, the cholesteatoma can also erode the area with the hearing nerve, leading to permanent nerve damage hearing loss.
Damage to the nerve that moves the face muscles can also occur.
Cholesteatoma treatment always includes surgery.
*****
Ear infections are very common in childhood and most kids outgrow them. However, if children continue to have ear infections off and on as they get older, consider an ENT evaluation to be sure a more serious, slowly developing complication does not occur.
Ear infections can lead to more serious problems and are not always as innocent as many people believe.

With soft oval green leaves that lead up to red bracts that gently change to a salmon color as it exposes its white flower, it's easy to see why the Justicia received its common name. Like the unassuming but alluring guest at the party the shrimp plant is one of the most unusual forms, but it doesn't necessarily scream out at you. Not only is the shrimp plant one of the most visually intriguing plants but it is generally low maintenance and drought tolerant as a landscape plant -- score. 
 Flickr photo by Random McRandomhead  The shrimp plant is an ornamental shrub native to Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. It thrives in the shade in warmer tropical areas. If utilized as a potted houseplant, give it a little direct sun at low intensity intervals to get a recurrent bloom. It prefers well-drained sandy or loamy soil. You can let the soil go slightly dry to the touch of your hand in between watering.   It can sometimes get long and spindly but with regular pruning can maintain a bushy and perky habit. There are different cultivars available with different bract colors but no matter the cultivar, it still makes me want to plan up a cocktail party. Go ahead and play with your 'food', pot up a shrimp plant and let it hang out at your next soiree.

482,HOME & LIVING,Home Makeover: A Drab Loft Bedroom Gets A Very Stylish Update (VIDEO),,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/home-makeover-loft-bed-transformation_us_5b9b7d84e4b03a1dcc78075c,"Next up, it was necessary to tackle the cubby-like opening next to Anthony's bed. To make better use of this recessed space",2012-03-25,ARTS & CULTURE,"The Homeowner: Anthony Layser
The Dilemma: This is a studio apartment with a lofted space. Because Anthony wanted to use the living area as an entertaining space, his bed ended up in the loft area. Additionally, the space had an odd layout -- there was a cubby-like opening near the bed area that was not being utilized. While not everyone has a lofted space, many people have wasted space that could be better put to use, and Anthony's loft bedroom is an example of just that.
The Fix: Since the loft will serve as Anthony's 'bedroom', it was important that the resulting space feel comfortable and personal to him. So, the team took cues from Anthony's huge collection of vintage items and decided to go with a nautical theme for the loft area. 
First, it was important to address the popcorn ceiling, which was discolored from age. While covering up the unsightly ceiling with pressed-tin tiles would have been great, a more cost-effective alternative was to use fabric instead. Thus, a nautical toile was picked out and faux-upholstered on to the ceiling using double-stick mounting tape. After that, the wall light in the space was replaced with something slightly unusual: A porch light. And, as a way to brighten up the space more, the fixture was installed upside down, which throws the light upwards and also gives it a nautical look.
Next up, it was necessary to tackle the cubby-like opening next to Anthony's bed. To make better use of this recessed space, it was transformed into a mini entertainment center and storage area. A floating shelf and a notched shelf were added, which provided room for storing extra bed linens, records and books/magazines. 
For the final touches, the bedding was switched out in favor of a classic plaid duvet and sheet set, and the pillows were put in a L shape, which gives the bed more of a lounge-like feel and lets Anthony sit and read comfortably. And, to bring added personality and color to the space, vintage book cover postcards and framed script pages that Anthony had collected were brought in as accents for the space.

1. Store wine away from direct light, which can damage or prematurely age your wine. Surprisingly, ultraviolet light can even penetrate dark-colored glass and impart unpleasant aromas.  2. The optimum long-term storage temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F, and sudden dramatic changes in temperature should be avoided. That said, wine will likely last for a year or two between 40 and 70 degrees F, as long as changes in temperature are gradual rather than sudden.  3. Humidity should be maintained between 50 and 80 percent so that the cork doesn't dry out and crumble or lose its seal.  4. Store wine on its side rather than upright to keep the cork damp.  5. Wine should be stored in a calm place, as excessive vibration can disturb the sediment and damage the wine.  6. Face the label upward so that you don't disturb the bottle when trying to read it.  7. Store all bottles accessibly so that you're not constantly moving them when you want to drink.

The tiny quarters had once been a space for the doorlady, and it was half underground. After a makeover that included a lot of custom, DIY furniture, Potvin dubbed the home the ""cozy cave.""
The couple lived here while Potvin was pregnant* and have even hosted dinner parties in this reduced volume. Thanks to some dual-purpose furniture, the place now sleeps four. In addition to the queen bed in the bedroom, there's a couch bed for one in the living room and a nook under the stairs where the couple crafted a mattress on top of what was once a little-used ledge.
Much of the home is custom, and all was crafted by the creative couple. Potvin found an old pallet on the street and covered it with plastic to create a stylish coffee table (with space for magazines and books between the wood). A salvaged door is now the hallway mirror, and old airplane food storage carts serve as bedside tables.
Many items are half-sized, like the bathroom sink and the refrigerator, but Potvin doesn't view the space as less enjoyable than the huge apartment she once rented in New York. ""You just don't bring much stuff in, I think that's the difference. You buy food for the next few days -- maybe you're more in the moment, more kind of basic and in the moment.""

But, a book about the grains of different types of wood or an encyclopedia of sailing knots will be referenced more times than you can imagine.",2014-03-27,ARTS & CULTURE,"If you think that men are hard to shop for, try shopping for an architect. They're notoriously fussy about the things that they want, use, display and otherwise select to be part of their lives. I have first-hand experience with this unique breed of human because I married one. Though, that doesn't make me any more qualified to shop for one. 
So, how are we normal laypeople supposed to crack the code and maybe even cause them to crack a smile with the gifts we give? I went straight to the experts at ArchDaily.com, the World's most visited architecture website, for some answers. I spoke with Karissa Rosenfield, their US Editor, who said, ""Gifts that stand out to an architect are those that are beautiful, unique, inspire creativity, educate and streamline any overly complex aspect of daily life."" Ok, that's a lot to think about. And,I'm still confused. 
 So how exactly can we hone in on that even more? 
Here are a few tips from Karissa:
Be observant Stalk their Pinterest boards for ideas of what they like Be sure to follow exact instructions when they admit to admiring a specific item  You can never go wrong with mid-century modern
And, if you're in a pinch, Karissa suggests scooping up something that they can use to perfect their craft like a pocket sized sketch pad for moments of inspiration. In general, architects like things done with intention and merit so a finely prepared meal or cocktail will also impress them. You can give them a gift-certificate to a restaurant with creative and well-executed cuisine or a cocktail book for them to perfect their skills at home. For a more romantic option, prepare a fine meal and cocktail combo at home. 
One thing that I've learned from my husband is that architects like to get specific and obscure about things. A broad topic coffee table book about design will do nothing for him. But, a book about the grains of different types of wood or an encyclopedia of sailing knots will be referenced more times than you can imagine. 
No matter what you give, make sure that it is well designed, simple and useful if you want it to be appreciated by your favorite architect. They might be anal and hard to shop for, but they just want life to be beautiful. That sounds lovely to me.

Cable and Internet providers like you to believe that bundling your home phone is a great way to cut monthly costs. Though you may save a few bucks this way, you're still looking at paying an average of $40 a month for a landline. Why pay this pricey home phone bill when you can get free Internet phone service from providers like Ooma without sacrificing service or quality? Rated #1 for Home Phone Service by Consumer Reports for three years in a row, Ooma lets you make crystal-clear calls anywhere in the U.S. for free: Simply connect the device to your high-speed Internet and regular home phone, and activate online for free calls anytime. You are only responsible for paying applicable taxes and fees, saving you nearly $500 annually.
Text Messaging
These days, our fingers do all the talking as we turn to text messaging for instant communication. While this feature seems inexpensive at an average of $15 per month for an unlimited plan, the markup on this service is outrageous at 6,500 percent. According to CNN Money, text messages use very little data and cost mobile carriers nearly nothing to send so it's pure profit. That's why you will be happy to hear that there are a growing number of free messaging apps like TextFree, ChompSMS and Google Voice that let you send and receive messages at absolutely no cost while cutting your mobile bill by $180 or more a year.
Hair Care
A survey conducted by Tresemme shows that women spend $50,000 on hair services over a lifetime including cuts, color, shampoo/conditioner and other styling product purchases. Though this figure is shocking, you don't have to give up taming your tresses to save money. Beauty schools are a great place to get free cuts and even color application as students need real models to practice on. Though this makes some people quiver, rest assured there is a licensed professional supervising the trainees during each session. Check out the website for The National Accrediting Commission of Career Arts & Science to find an accredited institution near you. Don't forget to ask your local salon about free or deeply discounted stylist-in-training services, too. For instance, Bumble in Bumble in New York offers free haircuts, styles and color through the University Model Project.
Kids' Meals
We've all seen the promotion for ""buy one adult entree, get one kid's meal free,"" but not every restaurant that offers this special advertises it. According to MyKidsEatFree.com, 80 percent of Kids Eat Free specials are promoted via word of mouth, which means you could be missing out on such deals. Next time you plan your family outing, review this list of 101 Restaurants where Kids Eat Free from MrFreeStuff.
Massages
Massages are not just a luxury service: they are often touted for offering multiple benefits to overall health including improved blood flow, reduced anxiety and strengthened immune system, as explained by Science Daily. Unfortunately, massage services can be pricey and regular visits are far from an option. Though you can usually score a daily deal for nearly 50 percent off a back rub, you still have to cough up the rest of the cash plus tip (at usually 20 percent of the regular rate before discount). That's why I suggest heading to a massage school where you can find free or reduced rate massages in return for students gaining experience. Aside from massage schools, check your local community college or hospital for massage training programs. Since appointments are typically limited and book quickly, check back frequently.
Dental Care
Did you know that your oral health directly affects your overall health and has been linked to various diseases like endocarditis, cardiovascular disease and diabetes? Though daily brushing, flossing and eating healthy foods play important roles in keeping your mouth healthy, regular dental checkups and professional cleanings are a must. If you don't have dental insurance don't worry about the high cost of care because there are plenty of free options. For instance, you can find free dental clinics in your area by searching FreeDental.org or call a local dental school to find out about free services provided by students. Though you may have to enter a pool before you become a patient, it's a great way to keep costs down without compromising your health.

We caught up with Michael Wurm, Jr., blogger behind Inspired By Charm  to learn how he manages it all and what he does to relax and recharge. And lucky for us, he's shared beautiful photos of how he has styled the stunning 1917 colonial he calls home, making this a house tour we had to share. 
For the last five years, Wurm has owned and managed Old Charm in his hometown of Saint Mary's, PA, after leaving his job in Philadelphia at a major hospitality chain to pursue his dream of opening a B&B and blogging about crafting, decorating and entertaining in his free time. And he has done just that, except his free time has become harder to come by these days. On a typical morning he starts by preparing a gourmet breakfast for his guests, refreshing their rooms, checking new patrons in, all while trying to get his latest crafts and recipes photographed for the blog while there is still natural light. 
Wurm originally got the idea to blog after following Posie Gets Cozy and was instantly inspired. And although he lives in a small town, he feels that his online community keeps him connected to the bigger world, and attributes this platform for the opportunity to meet so many inspirational people. Although he admits that his iPhone and laptop are his lifelines throughout the day, he says it's ""not a good thing how connected we are"" and makes sure to take some time away from the internet. ""I'm a huge fan of Sundays!"" he told us, and uses this day to unplug, ""veg out"" and catch up on Law & Order. But he's also a huge proponent of getting offline to go out and see new things because although there are many beautiful and inspiring images on the computer, you need to step away to come up with new ideas that haven't been done before. 
Right now, he's got a lot on his plate, and is looking to focus on what's most important to him -- his blogging, decorating and photography. And Wurm's design philosophy should be taken to heart. He says your home doesn't have to be picture-perfect; just use what you have and what you love and whatever makes you smile. Click through our slideshow below for a sneak peek of his enchanting space and head over to Inspired By Charm  for craft ideas, recipes, giveaways and more.

500,HOME & LIVING,Master Spring Cleaning With These Surprising Tips,"Laura McHolm, Contributor
NorthStar Moving Company Co-Founder",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/spring-cleaning-tips_us_5b9d0047e4b03a1dcc83a635,Do you have a home story idea or tip? Email us at homesubmissions@huffingtonpost.com. (PR pitches sent to this address will,2013-04-03,ARTS & CULTURE,"So, it's that time of year again when we get down on our hands and knees and scrub our home top to bottom. Okay, well, it's the time of year you promised yourself you would do THE BIG CLEAN. Sponge? Check. Eco-friendly cleaning solutions? Check. Rubber gloves? Check. Ready, set, clean. What? You still haven't started? Or, you've pushed the task off to summer break? Come on now, here are two tips to get you spring cleaning:
  Have a spring mantra. How about ""Less is More."" Sure, you have heard that mantra before but have you really applied it? Visualize having to move. Do you really want to move all this stuff into your new place? If you don't, then it's time to put on your imaginary Mother Theresa habit and start giving your unwanted stuff to your favorite charity. Moving is the time in our lives when we get rid of the most stuff, so why not just pretend you're moving and make your spring clean a meaningful experience. What? You're still not cleaning? Okay, so you aren't motivated by doing good for the needy? Maybe, you need a little negative reinforcement for your lack of action? How's this: Set a date the spring cleaning has to be complete. If it's not done by that date you have to donate a $100 to your least favorite organization: you know the one. 
Okay, now we've got you cleaning! Here are 10 ideas to make the most of your cleaning frenzy and have you love the final result:
In the spring, it's time to put heavy fabrics, throw blankets and extra toss pillows in storage or if you are never going to use them again donate them to your favorite charity. Less things and textures will make you feel cool and clean. Clear clutter. If things like papers and magazines have been piling up, decide if you really need them. If so, this might be a good time to pack them away. If not, recycle them or donate to your local library. Out with the Poinsettias. Go to a local farmer's market and pick out spring plants to have in the house. Fresh plants help improve the flow of oxygen in your home, bringing in that clean spring-like air. Who doesn't love an orchid or a tulip plant? Closet purge. Pick one closet per weekend, and empty everything out of the closet onto the floor. I mean everything! Create four piles: ""keep,"" ""give away,"" ""throw away,"" and ""store."" If you can't remember the last time you used something, get rid of it! Think about the reuse your worn clothing will get from those who need it. Consider the benefits of digital photos: take pictures of nostalgic items you toss, and file images of items you store so you know exactly what is in each box. Seasonal turnover. Assess winter shoes, coats and purses. Will they make it another season? If so, put them in storage. If they won't make it another season donate them, they'll keep someone else cozy next year. And, no shopping for new spring clothes, that is until you make room. Get rid of an old item for every new item. 
If you have items to store think green when selecting a storage unit. Be sure to seek full-service moving and storage companies that use boxes made of 100% recyclable materials and use warehouse-style facilities that store items in reusable wooden vaults - greener for you, greener for the environment. The kids' rooms. Purchase bed raisers for under-the-bed storage. You can store everything from shoes, laundry basket, books and any bulky items that might otherwise clutter their room. Get the kids involved in taking some items to the Goodwill or the charity of your choice. Are you kids lucky enough not to know what the under privileged look like? Time for a ""drive by"" of a neighborhood they haven't frequented. My parents took me on a little drive like that when I announced at the dinner table that so and so was poor because she rode her sister's bike. My mother was horrified that I had no concept of what ""poor"" really meant. You get rid of food when moving so why not do it now? Sort through kitchen cabinets and box up canned foods that you have not used in three months. Donate them to Move for Hunger or your local food bank. One in four children in Los Angeles go to bed hungry. Are kids going to bed hungry where you live? Once you have sorted everything, throw a reverse housewarming party! When your friends say ""housewarming?"" tell your friends ""I am not moving, but my stuff is."" You will be starting a new party trend. Set aside your unwanted items and instead of having your friends bring a housewarming gift, they are to pick one of your items and take it home with them. This is a great way to reunite with friends, find your unwanted things a good home, and de-clutter all at the same time!  Last but not least, step back and take a pictures of your ""new"" home and place them on the inside of a drawer to refer to, so you can keep it that way! Really, do it. You won't have to revisit organizing for a long time! 
Come on, you'll love your new clean space and yourself for it!

The TLC reality show (a spinoff of the also popular yet horrifying ""Toddlers & Tiaras""), follows the life of child beauty pageant contestant Alana Thompson (Honey Boo Boo) and her family in rural McIntyre, Georgia. And immediately after its initial air date this past August, it became one of the most talked about television programs.
So what better way to close out the year and prepare for the show's return in January than by taking a house tour of the family's humble abode? Alana's mother, June, takes us through the home for a quick tour and inside peek at their daily life.
The tour begins in the family room, where you can find an entertainment center adorned with pageant tiaras. And the shelf right beside it is lined with trophies and sashes. The storage room, or what June, a serious ""couponer,"" refers to as the ""stockpile room,"" is devoid of any pageant paraphernalia. Instead, the wall-to-wall shelves are filled with a three year's supply of toilet paper, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant and other toiletry items. There's also plenty of barbecue and hot sauce -- which she explained are both staples in the family's diet.
June also takes us through the girls' rooms, the kitchen (where she stops to snack on some cheese and honey) and the master bedroom, where all of the girls gather to get ready in the morning like the pageant queens they are.
In the video above, you'll get a taste of how the family lives and what Honey Boo Boo is all about. If you've ever seen the show, you know what to expect from the Thompson-Shannon clan. If you haven't, you'll quickly be horrified, intrigued and totally enamored by the family's completely outrageous ways, all at the same time.

Just click 'Send Us A Tip' at the bottom of this post with your account's URL.) Now, just in time for the Fourth of July, we bring you one of the most popularly-pinned crafts that will help you celebrate this holiday in style: an easy DIY twist on the classic American flag. Take a peek at this fun and patriotic craft from Brown Paper Packages: 
 Photo by Kierste W. of Brown Paper Packages.  
You'll need: 
At least a three-foot piece of 2""x4"" lumber Handsaw  Red, blue and white craft paint Foam paint brush Card stock (or any other thick paper) Exacto knife Sandpaper 
Perfect for indoors or outdoors, these rustic wooden flag blocks will definitely show off your patriotic side. To start you'll need to cut your blocks from pieces of lumber. You'll need two 7-inch long blocks and four 3.5-inch long blocks. First, stack the two longer blocks on top of each other. Place the four 3.5-inch blocks on top of the longer blocks, two standing up, back to back, and the other two stacked flat. Next paint the front edges of the blocks laying flat, alternating between red and white. These will be your flag's stripes. Next you'll paint the front of the standing block blue. When this dries, draw a three-inch star onto a card stock or any other thick and durable paper, cut it out with an exacto knife, and use it to stencil a star onto the blue block with white paint. Then use your sand paper to smooth the edges and give the paint a distressed finish. You can add a coat of Minwax Dark Walnut stain for an even more weathered look. Finally, tie the blocks together using a wired ribbon to create a neat little gift for America's birthday. For the full tutorial, visit Brown Paper Packages.

And, if you don't already know, we're big fans of the colorful textiles, prints and home items by the Finnish design firm, which just celebrated their 60-year anniversary last fall with the opening of a New York flagship store. 
The Marimekko doodles were purposefully chosen by Google to celebrate the change of seasons -- today is the equinox and marks the first day of spring. And, each doodle draws inspiration from an iconic pattern by the design firm. It also happens to be a big year for the Finnish company's hometown, Helsinki, which has been named the World Design Capital of 2012.
So, kudos to you Google for always being seemingly one step ahead of, well, the world. And, kudos to the Google Doodle -- for the design love! Check out more Marimekko designs at marimekko.com.

510,LATINO VOICES,Salma Hayek Sends Cute Message To Her Cousin Competing At Rio 2016,Lee Moran,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/salma-hayek-good-luck-cousin-rio_us_57b30d00e4b0c75f49d81c71,"""Viva Las Hayeks!!"" the Hollywood star wrote on Instagram.",2016-08-16,VOICES,"Salma Hayek is seriously rooting for her cousin at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games.
The Mexico-born actress wrote a sweet message of support for Olympic long jumper Yvonne Treviño Hayek on Instagram Sunday.
“I’m excited to see my cousin, Yvonne Treviño Hayek, (who I haven’t had the pleasure to meet yet) to compete representing Mexico for the long jump at the Olympics next week,” the Hollywood star wrote in the caption.
“Viva Las Hayeks!!” the “Frida” actress added, before repeating the post in Spanish and saying, “I am very proud!”
In a further show of support, Hayek later reposted a snap of the 27-year-old standing by the Olympic rings and urged everyone to watch her cousin compete.
Hayek’s dreams of Olympic glory were halted when her father stopped her from being drafted onto Mexico’s national gymnastic team when she was a child.
But her Houston-based relative, whose grandfather is Salma’s father’s cousin, has gone on to break her country’s long jump record and Tuesday she will become the first female long jumper to represent Mexico at a Games since 1968.

511,LATINO VOICES,#QueridaKellyOsbourne Calls Star Out On Her Non-Apology To Latinos,Carolina Moreno,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/queridakellyosbourne-the-view-latinos_us_55c23a18e4b0f7f0bebb2ec0,"“In Spanish as well as Portuguese, ‘querida’ can be used with love or contempt, and I'd venture to say most people responded with the latter.""",2015-08-05,VOICES,"After Kelly Osbourne's ill-considered portrayal of Latinos as toilet bowl cleaners on Tuesday's episode of ""The View,"" the host issued what many considered to be a non-apology for her comments that only further infuriated parts of the community. 
The 30-year-old star was a guest host on the talk show when the conversation turned to Donald Trump’s anti-Latino remarks in June. Osbourne then took a shot at the Republican presidential candidate that ultimately backfired.
""If you kick every Latino out of this country, then who is going to be cleaning your toilet, Donald Trump?"" Osbourne said.
Latinos online, however, were less forgiving. In a statement to The Huffington Post, which she later posted on her Facebook, Osbourne said she would not apologize for being racist, but admitted she’d made a mistake. 
 I want to start by saying I ALWAYS take responsibility for my actions. In this particular case I will take responsibility for my poor choice of words but I will not apologize for being a racist as I am NOT. I whole-hearted f**ked up today. I don’t want to bulls**t anyone with lame excuses. Although, I was stopped mid-sentence by Rosie and couldn’t finish my point I will not let Rosie take responsibility for my words. I should have known better as I was on The View and it was live. I’ve learned a very valuable lesson. It is my hope that this situation will open up a conversation about immigration and the Latin community as a whole. By the way I clean my own f**king toilets. 
 
Colorlines news editor Aura Bogado started #QueridaKellyObsourne, which used the Spanish word for “dear” in contempt, to point out Osbourne's non-apology. The hashtag quickly went viral, allowing many on Twitter to address the British star and vent their frustration with her comments. 
In a statement to The Huffington Post, Bogado said she put a lot of thought in crafting the hashtag, and employing a word in both Spanish and Portuguese since language is “so often negatively entangled in conversations about Latinos and immigration.”
The editor also said the word “querida” was ideal because of its versatility.
“In Spanish as well as Portuguese, ‘querida’ can be used with love or contempt, and I'd venture to say most people responded with the latter,” Bogado continued. “Either way, the idea was to communicate to Osbourne, and put the ball in her court. Not surprisingly, she has yet to respond to the thousands of people who've written to her with this hashtag.”
Despite originating the viral hashtag, Bogado said very few outlets have attributed it to her -- something she feels speaks to the larger problem of visibility for Latinos and women online.
“What's been intriguing for me to watch is the way my work has been largely rendered invisible by the media writing about the hashtag,” Bogado said in her statement.
“The irony is that the hashtag itself is a commentary against invisibility -- specifically against making latinas invisible,” she added. “I use the word intrigue because, since I have a platform both on and off Twitter, I'm not necessarily mad about it. But it does point to the fact that media have a difficult time recognizing women's work, and in this case, a latina's digital work in particular.""
Many Latinos, however, did recognize Bogado's work and #QueridaKellyOsbourne quickly went viral. Take a look at some of the hashtag's best tweets below:

512,LATINO VOICES,"Highly Criticized ‘Frozen’ Short Is Leaving Theaters, But Not For The Reason You Think",Carolina Moreno,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/frozen-pixar-short-film-coco_us_5a2583d6e4b03c44072f52d6,"Fans will soon be able to watch ""Coco"" without sitting through more than 20 minutes of an unrelated short film.",2017-12-04,VOICES,"“Olaf’s Frozen Adventure” is coming to an end ― and not a minute too soon, according to many Pixar fans. 
Moviegoers were largely critical of the short film, which runs more than 20 minutes and airs ahead of the box office hit “Coco.” Rumors circulated last week that the backlash had inspired the Disney-owned Pixar to remove the short, and Mashable reported it would be pulled on Dec. 8. 
But Disney told Entertainment Weekly on Sunday that the short was always meant to air for a limited time. 
“This was always promoted as a limited run so it’s not really a story — the end of our Olaf theatrical play is coming next week,” a Disney representative told the publication. “All our ads and messaging called it as such.”
“Coco” co-director Adrian Molina responded to the criticism of the Olaf film in an interview last week. 
“It is longer than, I think, any other short that has ever been attached to one of these films, so I’ve heard that that has taken people by surprise,” Molina told HuffPost. 
Pixar feature films are known to be preceded by animated shorts, but Molina said showing a lengthier version was “a little bit of an experiment.”
“This year was a particular situation where we had two films out from Pixar in the same year,” he said, adding that “Cars 3” was paired with a short in the works called “Lou.”
Despite the negative reviews of the “Frozen”-themed addition, “Coco” has been warmly greeted by audiences and critics alike. The film, which is inspired by Mexico’s Day of the Dead celebration, took the No. 1 spot at the box office during its Thanksgiving-weekend opening, and has remained on top since. In less than two weeks, it has also become Mexico’s highest-grossing movie ever and received the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Animated Film.

513,LATINO VOICES,American Latinas: Leadership and Economic Force,"Ana Maria Fernandez Haar, ContributorChair of the Board, NAA Institute; Managing Partner, Victorian...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/american-latinas-leadersh_b_6172172.html,"We must not allow our currently dismal under-representation in corporate and political life to weaken our resolve, for the indicators are moving in the right direction and clearly point to opportunities unimaginable just a few generations ago.",2014-11-18,VOICES,"The assertion that Latinas have come a long way -- which is not to say that there isn't a long way to go -- is informed by meta-analysis and thoughtful observation of women's participation in the fullness of American life, over time. In assessing our progress as it relates to the New America Alliance's (NAA) founding pillars of growing human capital, economic capital, political capital and the capacity for strategic philanthropy, the evidence suggests not only tangible achievements on all these fronts, but also a powerful momentum, the full effects of which are yet to be measured and felt by the country as a whole. Yet felt it will be.
We must not allow our currently dismal under-representation in corporate and political life to weaken our resolve, for the indicators are moving in the right direction and clearly point to opportunities unimaginable just a few generations ago. Our foremothers knew that bending the arc of the moral universe toward equality was not a short-term endeavor. It took nearly 100 years for Congress to pass -- and for the states to ratify -- the 19th Amendment to the Constitution: Women's Right to Vote (1920). They would be amazed at the speed of today's communications, knowledge-based economy and its ability to accelerate societal change at all levels. 
Ours is an age of complex inter-dependent networks where concerted, strategic actions on multiple fronts tend to work best. The United Nations said as much when it merged four of the organization's agencies in 2011 to create UN SWAP, the United Nations System-wide Action Plan on gender equality and women's empowerment, now operating as UN Women. It addressed a broad range of issues including the ""reaffirmation that women's rights were human rights and that gender equality was an issue of universal concern, benefiting all"". This UN Action Plan serves as an inspirational blueprint for countless women-focused initiatives throughout the globe. The New America Alliance American Latina Caucus has drawn its own inspiration from their approach. 
Consumer research -- from reputable sources such as the Census Bureau, Pew Center, HACU, Amerédia and others -- invariably foretell potential outcomes before they become self-evident in the greater marketplace. Nielsen, one of the most respected leaders in the field, recently published ""Latina Power Shift"" as part of their Diverse Intelligence Series. To quote the study's Executive Summary:
 ""Latinas are outpacing Latino males in their educational pursuits and career development, are overwhelmingly the decision-makers in household spending, have surpassed the proportion of non-Hispanic white families with children, and through their youth and increased incomes have become an attractive consumer segment who is being actively courted by marketers."" 
This report, which we consider required reading for anyone interested in the Latinas of today and tomorrow -- concurs with other sources that cite Latina gains in higher education, earnings, entrepreneurship and political engagement. And while the data-driven insights are critical to any discussion, there is another major ""shift"" impacting the national arena. In addition to broadcast media, the democratization of information (Internet, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms) has created countless new ways to communicate and connect. All the messages and images out there are constantly shaping the very perceptions that ultimately make our society. The NAA women aim to increase those positive representations for we agree with Marie Wilson of The White House Project, who said ""you can't be what you can't see"".
Many of our NAA female founding members broke glass ceilings of their own. Yet then, in 1999, a Latina Supreme Justice seemed but a dream. Justice Sonia Sotomayor has since inspired legions of American Latinas to see themselves in law careers, full of possibilities. This is but one example among thousands.
Seeing role models of ""women like me"" is the first way most of our young women feel validated and inspired to consider what may be possible for them to achieve. Yes, what is possible for one is possible for others. 
In our quest for increased Latino participation in small business creation and expansion, the NAA has always advocated for diverse leadership at the U.S. Small Business Administration. Today, an NAA member, Maria Contreras-Sweet is the Administrator of that agency. 
Dr. Antonia Novello, the first Latina Surgeon General was a rarity in 1990. Today, Elena Rios, MD is the President and CEO of the National Hispanic Medical Association, surrounded by many other Latina physicians. 
On a personal note, when I was twelve years old I couldn't even begin to imagine an Anna Maria Chavez leading the Girl Scouts. 
Nely Galan, founder of the Adelante Movement, is making a huge difference. She is business, leadership and service in action. 
Look to our own Women's Panel at the upcoming Wall Street Summit. From Lorraine Cortés-Vázquez serving as the first Latina Secretary of State in New York and now leading at AARP, to Jackie Cacho breaking barriers in entertainment/production, Alice Rodríguez rising at Chase, Alejandra Castillo at Commerce and Alejandra Ceja at the White House, these extraordinary women are opening doors, moving through them and leaving them open for others to follow. NAA CEO Pilar Avila together with Carmen Ortiz McGhee, another NAA alumna, is destined to open even more doors. As accomplished as they are already, these women are just at the starting gate of what they will ultimately achieve and the contributions they will make to our country. 
Beyond sharing stories of what is possible, the NAA American Latina Leadership Caucus will illustrate the different roads toward achievement, and its members will mentor, support, encourage, introduce and do whatever is possible to make certain that legions of ""hermanas"" get through the big doors. It's the smart -- and also right -- thing to do for our country.

Quedarse en casa de por sí es un gran compromiso de parte de los papás.",2015-05-31,VOICES,"Cuando la producción de ""Realidades en Contexto"", de CNN en Español, me invitó para un debate acerca de los hombres que se quedan en casa para cuidar de los niños, confieso que tuve un flashback, no necesariamente de una buena etapa de mi vida. 
El tema tiene muchos ángulos para discutir. Hay quienes están a favor, otros en contra. Cada día es más creciente el número de papás que se quedan en casa, no aportan de forma tradicional un ingreso financiero al hogar y cuidan de los niños. 
Honestamente, en un momento de mi vida lo pensé, lo intenté, pero no me funcionó. Hoy todavía sigo pensando que ese ""acuerdo"" es una situación muy personal, muy de pareja y muy divina si se habla y se planifica. 
A pesar de mi mala experiencia, sin entrar en mayores detalles, sigo pensando que es un ambiente idóneo cuando hay niños menores de 18 años, especialmente cuando se tiene más de un hijo y la madre tiene una consolidada carrera profesional y deseos de crecer laboralmente en los años más productivos de su vida.
Aquí radica la grandeza de una pareja que decide emprender junta el difícil camino de la paternidad. Es un signo de inteligencia y madurez el dialogar y establecer quién se puede quedar en casa o trabajar a tiempo parcial porque los niños necesitan atención, educación, amor y calor de hogar. Sigo creyendo que con ese cuento de que lo que importa es calidad no cantidad nos han tratado de dorar la píldora muchas veces. Se necesita cantidad y calidad. 
Por mi experiencia como madre -y sin haber tenido esa posibilidad de quedarme en casa porque me incorporé a mi demandante trabajo como productora de televisión, con viajes incluidos, cuando mi hija tenía apenas tres meses de vida- no hay estructura que sustituya el cuido y la garantía educativa que ofrece la familia.
Tengo amigas a quienes tampoco les fue bien con esto de los ""amos de casa"". Los hombres terminaban metidos en el hogar, viendo tele, sin hacer casi labores domésticas ni mayores actividades con los niños y cuando ellas llegaban -cansadas del trabajo- tenían que empezar la otra faena.
Otras de mis amigas empezaron con debates existenciales acerca de si ellas eran las que trabajaban, de si los hombres eran los que tenían que proveer, que qué pensaría la gente, que si ""mantengo"" a mi marido. Consumidas por las dudas, algunas destruyeron sus matrimonios.
Pero hay increíbles ejemplos como el de mi editora en jefe, Marinés Arroyo, quien tiene tres hijos y el papá, Héctor Ambrogi, cuida de los pequeños.
""Trabajaba desde antes de quedar embarazada en un empleo fijo. Él tenía un trabajo a cuenta propia, y muy flexible, en donde él mismo hacía su horario. Yo sé cuán capaces son los papás, o al menos algunos, de cuidar a sus hijos. Mi papá fue quien me cuidó en mi casa antes de que yo cumpliera un año, mientras mi mamá salía a diario a trabajar en una oficina. Mi papá fue también quien me ayudó a cuidar a mi primer hijo mientras yo salía a trabajar. No tenía problema repitiendo esa historia, muy al contrario"", cuenta Marinés.
Muchos se preguntan: ¿Qué ventajas hay que un papá sea quien cuide de los niños mientras la mamá trabaja? ¿Alguna desventaja?
""Así como les sucede a muchas mamás, es natural que en algún momento el papá sienta la necesidad de salir de la casa a generar ingresos. Quedarse en casa de por sí es un gran compromiso de parte de los papás que están acostumbrados a trabajar fuera del hogar, y deben como mínimo buscar qué hacer para distraerse una vez mamá llega a la casa, o durante el fin de semana, así sea ir al gimnasio. Si ya papá se cansó de estar todos los días en casa, es hora entonces de llegar a un justo acuerdo luego de revisar alternativas, como la posibilidad de matricular a los hijos -que tal vez ya no están tan bebés-, en una guardería"", comparte Marinés. 
Las estadísticas nos ponen a pensar en por qué el fenómeno de los padres que se quedan en casa va en aumento.
En el 2012, se contabilizó que 2 millones de padres no tenían un empleo y cuidaban de los niños en el hogar, según el Pew Research Institute. La recesión que experimentó Estados Unidos desde el 2007 hasta el 2009 fue una razón importante para este auge de los ""amos de casa"".
De acuerdo con el estudio del Pew, un 23 por ciento de los papás que se quedan en el hogar asegura que lo hace porque no puede encontrar un buen empleo, mientras que un 21 por ciento reconoce que quiere cuidar de los pequeños y de la casa. Esto contrasta con un 5 por ciento que tomó la decisión de no ir a laborar a la calle en 1989.
Un detalle que me llamó la atención es que cuando se indagó la opinión pública acerca de quién debía cuidar de los niños, un 51 por ciento cree que los menores están mejores cuidados por sus mamás que por los papás, en comparación con un 8 por ciento que sí cree que los padres son mejores que las madres para estas tareas. 
Lo que hay de común entre mamás y papás encuestados es que a ambos se les hace difícil encontrar un balance entre las labores del hogar y las responsabilidades profesionales. Adicionalmente, un 48 por ciento de los padres y un 52 por ciento de las madres cree que es mejor quedarse en casa para educar y cuidar de los chicos. Sin embargo, ese mismo porcentaje reconoció que tiene que trabajar porque necesita el ingreso económico.
Las conclusiones quedan a consideración de cada uno. Para mí ¡que vivan los amos de casa! No hay nada más sexy que un buen padre.

Now is the time we turn our anger towards something productive with tangible results.",2016-11-14,VOICES,"It’s been almost one week since Donald Trump was elected President in probably what’s been the most shocking Presidential election in American history. Since then, I’ve watched people blame the DNC, Hillary Clinton, non-voters, third party voters, women, Florida, Latinos, and each other for Trump’s win. 
I’ve watched friends admonish family members for voting for Trump. I’ve seen hate crimes against Latinos, Blacks, Muslims and other minorities increase. The Southern Poverty Law Center has documented over 200 incidents in the first 48 hours after the election alone. These are alarming numbers considering Trump hasn’t even taken office yet.
I’ve watched thousands of people in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and other major cities mobilize and protest against Donald Trump. There are Inauguration Day protest marches being planned and never have the American people been as opposed to a U.S. President as they are against Donald Trump. It is a moment in time unlike anything I’ve ever seen. 
The actions many are taking to voice their anger, rage, and fear speaks volumes of the division a Donald Trump presidency has already created in this country. He speaks of unifying the nation but his failure to address the recent blatant acts of racism by his supporters doesn’t support his rhetoric. 
Furthermore, his appointment of Steve Bannon, the Breitbart News Network executive chairman known for having white nationalist views, as chief strategist and senior counselor, does nothing to instill hopes of a unified nation under a Trump administration. Trump cannot expect the American people to believe his words when his actions are not aligned with what he is saying.
To say that passions are at an all-time high with Americans is an understatement. People are outraged, especially considering that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. It has caused many to challenge the current Electoral College process and question if it’s time to do away with it altogether. Donald Trump as president is not what the majority of Americans want, yet that is what we are left to deal with for the next four years. Carrying signs and hash tagging “Not My President” doesn’t change that. Trump is our President and we are stuck with him despite how much or how loud we protest. The question is what are we going to do now that he is? Did I vote for Trump? Absolutely not. Do I think he is the wrong person to lead this country? Unequivocally yes. But now isn’t the time to point fingers.
Now is the time we take our outrage and turn our anger towards something productive with tangible results. We cannot change the Presidential outcome, but we can mobilize in our communities. We can roll up our sleeves and do the hard grassroots work that is required of us. We can take responsibility for our neighborhoods and engage with our local representatives on a real level through deliberate dialogue. We can hold them to task by making our faces seen and our voices heard at every town hall meeting. We can get to know our local police chiefs, and our school superintendents. We can get to know our assembly men and women and educate ourselves on policies they’ve advocated for or against. We can call out injustice every time we see it and not just rant about in a Facebook post. 
The time is now for all disenfranchised groups to band together for the greater good of this country. If we try to fight for each group’s equality individually we will be fighting forever and we will never know what equal rights for all looks like. This division among us is precisely why Trump is our President. Divide and conquer is a real tactic and it’s the reason we need to stop dividing the fight for equality into sub groups for Blacks, Latinos, Women, LGBTQ, Muslims, Native Americans etc. Now is the time for all of us to unite if we indeed do believe in equality for all. 
Considering the country’s current political climate when it comes to race relations, women’s rights, police violence, healthcare, immigration, among the many other issues that plague this country, Trump’s inability to inspire unity, acceptance, and hope is dangerous. He says he wants to make America great again for all Americans, but in the short week since he’s been elected, he’s done nothing by way of his actions, to give me hope that he will indeed do great things for all Americans. In fact, this past week he’s already begun back peddling on some of the key campaign promises that got him elected like building that wall along the Mexican border.
In his first interview since his election, Trump told Leslie Stahl from 60 Minutes, that the infamous wall he plans on building across the Mexican border could be part fence. Part fence? Interesting how he never mentioned that during his campaign. His plan to immediately deport all undocumented citizens is another strategically fabricated lie. What he meant to say was, undocumented citizens who have committed crimes. 
What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate, Trump said. 
Are you deporting them or incarcerating them Mr. Trump? Which one is it? This sounds very different from what he was spewing on the campaign trail. Moreover, Obama has already deported 2.5 million undocumented criminals during his Presidency so Trump doing the same is no different from what the current administration is doing. I’m not quite sure how this is the change those who voted for Trump were seeking. 
What this proves to me is that a large segment of this country was so desperately seeking change, that they sided with the individual who seemed to present themselves as such. Trump isn’t doing anything differently, but the way he delivered his message sure made it seem like he was. Despite his more of the same politics on certain issues, the fact he is placing White supremacists in some of the key roles in his administration is what we should be concerned with. 
In my opinion, those who have his ear and those who are his advisers are greater cause for alarm as they will be instrumental in how Trump leads this country. To me, that is more frightening. If it were only Trump we had to worry about I wouldn’t be as concerned, because though Trump made a lot of promises during his campaign, considering his history with flip flopping on certain issues such as abortion, and considering how he is already deviating from some of his most popular campaign promises, it seems like he himself doesn’t know where he stands on certain issues. The only thing I am sure of when it comes to Trump is that he cannot be trusted. 
His ego centered narcissism is a direct contradiction of his ideology of wanting to make this country great again for all. He has never done anything for the greater good. His history proves that. His elitist mentality that has spanned over his 70 years doesn’t simply go away because he now finds himself elected President. Later this month he is scheduled to stand trial for the Trump University case. Not surprisingly his lawyers are asking for a postponement because, 
The President-Elect should not be required to stand trial during the next two months while he prepares to assume the Presidency. The time and attention to prepare and testify will take him away from imperative transition work at a critical time, Trump attorneys Daniel Petrocelli, David Marroso and David Kirman wrote.
We acknowledge plaintiffs have a right to trial of their claims, but their rights will not be abridged if trial were continued to a date after the inauguration to allow the President-Elect to devote all his time and attention to the transition process.
Once again Trump is trying to use his position, power, and privilege to his benefit. This is what we have traditionally seen from Trump and it is what we will continue to see for the next four years as he leads this country.Even though I would like nothing more to say that he is not my president, it still remains that he is. I can continue being angered by it and do nothing or I can use that anger and channel it towards working to create solutions that will challenge some of Trump’s policies designed to attack the most disenfranchised populations of this country. Come January the person chosen to lead us will change. The work I do, will not.

Celebrating Cinco De Mayo with Mexican inspired cuisine, the Taste of Mexico festival is an Austin classic that is not to be missed.  Food might be the reason why people pay attention but the bridge between cultures is why people attend. In a city filled with a history known for segregating minorities to different parts of its city, the Latino and Mexican American history that once found a home in downtown Austin is there no more. The only cultural artifact that remains is the Mexic-Arte Museum.  With a mission to educate the public through the enrichment and preservation of Mexican, Latino, and Latin American art, the Mexic-Arte Museum uses funds collected from the Taste of Mexico festival to give back to its visitors through classes, tours, and free admission on Sunday and the entire month of December.  While Cinco De Mayo might already be a tradition that is celebrated by many, the Taste of Mexico festival offers a unique counter narrative to the celebration of Mexico's unlikely victory over the French in 1862, offering a celebration of cultural pride through food, and not a victory through war.  With samplings and tastings from over 30 award winning restaurants, music, and activities, the Taste of Mexico festival lives as an example of cultural preservation for years to come!

519,LATINO VOICES,11 Quotes To Remember Jorge Luis Borges On His Birthday,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jorge-luis-borges-quotes_n_5698148.html,,2014-08-24,VOICES,"One of the most unique literary figures of the twentieth century, Jorge Luis Borges was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on this day in 1899.
As a master craftsman of the short story, Borges penned tales of Argentina’s criminal underbelly and created fictional worlds that captured his wonder with the concept of infinitude. His poems commemorate the unique culture and traditions of the capital of Buenos Aires, where he lived until his death in 1986.   Perhaps one of Latin America’s greatest writers, many view it as an injustice that he died without having received a Nobel Prize for literature. 
“It makes me a little ashamed to receive the Nobel Prize, given that Borges didn’t receive it,” Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa said after winning the coveted award in 2010. 
To mark the literary genius’s birthday, enjoy some of his most pithy quotes below.

The video, uploaded to YouTube Aug. 29, shows excerpts from news stories in which students of color across the country have been harassed at school. 
In one of the scenarios vandals hung a banner that read “build a wall” inside of an Oregon high school, imitating the Republican presidential candidate’s infamous immigration proposal.
“This is our school and this is where we learn. This is our environment. This is our second home, and it’s not fair that some of us don’t even feel safe coming,” explained a student featured in the video. 
In other cases highlighted in the ad, students chanted Trump’s name or waved cutouts of his face directed at students of color ― a move easily seen as intimidation. 
“Donald Trump is endangering our kids,” reads text featured in the ad. 
Trump’s rhetoric has incited an alarming level of fear and anxiety among children of color, many of whom worry they or a loved one will be deported, according to a report by the nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center titled “The Trump Effect: The Impact of the Presidential Campaign on our Nation’s Schools.”
The report also found some students have been “emboldened” by Trump’s divisive rhetoric:
 “Teachers have noted an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities have been the verbal targets of candidates on the campaign trail.”  
MoveOn’s ad aims to encourage viewers to protect kids from Trump’s hate speech by voting on November 8.
Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.

Democrat Xavier Becerra vacated his seat when he became the state’s attorney general in January. Carrillo is hoping to win the spot, and will possibly become the first formerly undocumented woman in Congress.
In a recent interview with Jezebel about her campaign, Carrillo discussed the normalization of hate since Donald Trump became president and offered David Duke’s Twitter attacks on her campaign as proof.
“The part that’s new about it is that it is now normalized,” she told Jezebel. “It is normalized racism, it is normalized hatred towards communities of color and towards immigrants. Before, you would see it in places like Arizona with Sheriff [Joe] Arpaio and the immigrant community there, and in other pockets around the country. But now it is entirely across the country and people feel emboldened to attack immigrants and people of color.”
Carillo was born in El Salvador during the civil war and her family fled to Southern California to escape the violence that killed her biological father. Eventually, she obtained legal status as a teen through her stepfather.
The Latina, who is running on a platform that aims to protect hardworking immigrants and Dreamers, was singled out by Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, in March. He subtweeted Carrillo’s campaign video and wrote that she “plays the part of a ‘person of color’ masterfully.” 
Duke didn’t stop there. He continued to tweet at Carrillo to mock her references to “Latino victory” and the portion of her campaign video that features people raising their fists. 
The Latina defended herself and the campaign from Duke on Twitter, and she discussed the incident with Jezebel.
“I personally have been attacked because of my story by David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the KKK, on social media,” she said. “And with that brings all the hatred and all the misogyny and all the racist anti-immigrant, anti-undocumented people, anti-women rhetoric on social media by the alt-right.”
“I knew that that would eventually happen because my campaign and my story is incredibly unique, especially running for office,” she continued. “It just becomes a completely different thing when you see it and when you experience it and you have to have conversations with your team about safety.”
Shortly after her Twitter exchange with Duke, Carrillo told We are mitú she responded as a way to fight back against the normalization of hate.
“I am sick and tired of politicians who claim to represent us but do not stand up as racism and misogyny is normalized in our country,” Carrillo said. “I refuse to sit quietly on the sidelines. David Duke is a Breitbart-reading, white-supremacy-preaching, ‘former’ Grand Wizard of the KKK who attacked me for telling my story as a formerly undocumented person and unrecognized refugee. So I called him out, and I did so unapologetically.”

The Queen of Tejano music was honored with a Madame Tussauds wax figure in August and a sold out MAC Cosmetic line in October that sent fans into a frenzy. And now, according to Deadline, there’s a TV adaption based off of widower Chris Perez’s biography To Selena, with Love in the works. 
Selena’s fan base seems to have only grown stronger in the 21 year since her death. So its no surprise that Endemol Shine North America and Major TV would option the television rights to Perez’ 2012 book, which gives an intimate look at the singer’s life and the love story she shared with her husband before her death.
“I spent several years keeping the memories of my late wife bottled up inside,” Perez wrote in a statement posted to his Facebook on Tuesday. “To Selena, with Love allowed me to finally embrace my experience and understand the void it could fill in the hearts of so many others. I am now ready to take the important step of being fully transparent and bringing my everlasting relationship to life on the screen.”
Perez’s book will be adapted for both English- and Spanish-speaking audiences, according to Cris Abrego, CEO of Endemol Shine North America. 
When Perez released the biography in 2012, he spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about how he hoped people would remember Selena. 
“People need to remember what she stood for, the values she had,” he told the publication. “If she gave any message to the younger generation, it would be: Stay in school, and anything is possible as long as you work for it. If people remembered her in that way, I’d be happy and I’m sure she would be happy, too.”

Under the theme “Celebrating and Empowering Dominican Women,” this year’s event will celebrate women working across the fields of technology, community service and the arts. 
“The organization’s high-level mission is to raise awareness of the Dominican community’s contributions to American society and to raise funds for the [Dominican Day Parade’s] scholarship program,” explained Dominican Day Parade, Inc. president Angela Fernandez in an email to The Huffington Post. “The theme of honoring and empowering Dominican women sits squarely at the intersection of those goals, especially in a year where all women’s issues play a significant role in the election. This was our small way of contributing to that message.”
Fernandez explained that the parade’s theme will address “women’s rights from a position of power, especially economic power and social justice.” It is for that reason, she said, that many of the honorees are women in business or social justice leaders.
“You will see a celebration of the Dominican women that [understands] the importance of women’s participation in the economic and educational development of our communities and who we think are the best role models for future generations,” she promised.
More than 20 trailblazing Dominican women will be honored at the parade Sunday, Aug. 14, including the parade’s Madrina (Godmother), Daisy Auger-Dominguez, who is Google’s Head of Global Diversity Staffing. Other honorees include Miss Rizos Beauty Salon owner and founder, Carolina Contreras; “Bird Of Paradise” author Raquel Cepeda; and the executive director of the Dominican Women Development Center, Rosita Romero, to name only a few.

In a reference to the hurricanes that ravaged Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Louisiana, Florida and Texas last year, Trump in his Tuesday night State of the Union address said, “We are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together, always.”
Machado, who is of Puerto Rican descent, slammed Trump for his remarks during an interview Thursday with BuzzFeed News’ AM to DM.
“He’s not with anybody but himself,” she said. “I hate talking about him ... but I will say this: They’re not doing enough.”
As the Chicago-born actress expressed her frustration over the widely criticized federal response to Hurricane Maria that hammered Puerto Rico in September, she also took aim at the president’s multiple draft deferments. 
“It’s a shame, it’s so sad because [Puerto Ricans] are American citizens. And we have fought in every, I mean, I have an uncle who’s a veteran from the Vietnam War — unlike this president who dodged the draft 5 times.”
She termed it “outrageous” that federal officials are not “doing what they should be doing” for the island.
“But the thing is we’re living in a time where every day there’s something outrageous,” she added. “So what do we do? We gotta keep it out there.”
The actress also spoke to BuzzFeed about Latino representation in the entertainment industry and wanting Hollywood to view diversity beyond black and white.
Machado similarly discussed misconceptions of Latinos depicted on television in an in-depth interview with Vox this week. 
The star said she would like to see the industry stop giving Latino characters accents or lines in Spanish when it doesn’t make sense for the story. 
“I cannot tell you what that does to me,” Machado told Vox. “And you know why? Because people think it’s funny when someone goes off in Spanish. And yeah, it might sound funny, because you don’t know what they’re saying, and it sounds like [trills R] that. But that’s offensive. If it’s not there for a reason, it’s offensive.”
“And also, don’t think that we’re all the same,” she continued. “Like I said, we don’t all have the same immigration story. We don’t all have that same story. If you’re not going to write it well, don’t write it. We don’t need it. We’ll do something ourselves.”

Josue Morin’s vintage-style cards feature the Queen of Tejano music in some iconic outfits and include wording that any Selena fan is sure to recognize.
“I wanted to incorporate some of her famous song lyrics on each card so that’s when my wife, Maria Madriz, came up with the wording,” he told HuffPost. 
The Mexican-born artist is currently selling the cards via Etsy, but says he initially created them only for his wife.
“People have reacted amazingly,” Morin said. “I first wanted to do the cards for my wife but my wife decided to share on social media by doing a giveaway and it went crazy! My Instagram [posts] ... got reviews and shout outs we didn’t even know about! I was just so excited people liked them because I worked hard creating them.”
Madriz isn’t the only Selena fan in the family, though. Morin says he loves the Tejano singer as much as his wife and hopes his two daughters will become fans.
“[Selena] was and still is a great role model for our Latino community,” he said. “She broke barriers between the Mexican and American culture. As a dad now of two young daughters, Selena is definitely an artist that my girls can listen to and look up to.”

And I’m going to keep talking. And I’m going to be really loud.”",2017-12-14,VOICES,"Distinguished guests and celebrities—including tennis star Serena Williams and her tech mogul husband Alexis Ohanian, Puerto Rican singer-actress Jeimy Osorio and The Real co-host Adrienne Bailon—came together in Miami last week to shine the spotlight on Puerto Rico’s post-hurricane recovery needs.
Held on Dec. 7 in Eden Roc Miami Beach hotel’s ballroom, the event was singer Ricky Martin and actress Eva Longoria’s second annual “Global Gift Gala,” with 100% of the proceeds going to benefit Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria.
After taking the stage, Martin began his formal remarks by announcing that 92% of the island of Puerto Rico has water. The audience’s applause was abruptly shortened when he added, “There’s only one problem—the water’s not drinkable.” The longtime Puerto Rican entertainer told the crowd:
“I wish I could be more light about this, but I got to be raw. I got to be honest. Nothing but injustice. We have been forgotten, and I’m really angry about it. And I’m going to keep talking. And I’m going to be really loud.” 
 Martin has led and joined the chorus of a growing group of global humanitarians who, with amplified voices, have had to walk a delicate tightrope. They are graciously making appeals for donations and support for Puerto Rico, acknowledging progress and generosity, while at the same time advocating for the urgent and immediate need for more aid. The disparaging reality is that Americans in Puerto Rico are unnecessarily suffering and dying; casualties are severely underreported (The New York Times recently reported the death toll might be as high as 1,052).
Everyday people from around the world have answered the calls to action for donations of food and supplies for Puerto Rico and millions of dollars have been raised. How is it possible, then, that over two months after Hurricane Maria hit and three weeks before Christmas and the start of a new year the majority of Americans in Puerto Rico are still living without drinking water, electricity, and adequate access to other daily essentials needed for survival, such as healthcare?
In 2016, the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico (practically everyone living there, as Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory) paid $3.6 billion in U.S. federal taxes. The U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico have consistently served in the military and have defended America in wars at disproportionately higher rates than their population size since 1917.
How is it possible that the large majority of U.S. citizens living in Florida and Texas, who were also impacted by catastrophic hurricanes, have drinking water and electricity, but the large majority of U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico do not? 
These are simple questions being asked, yet the answers are complicated, with political, moral, and racial undertones. One could give a simple answer like, “There is a lack of infrastructure in Puerto Rico as compared to Florida and Texas.” However, the second question would then become, “Why?” One could answer the second question by saying, “Because U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico do not have the right to vote for the U.S. president,” and then the second question still remains “Why?” If U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico can pay U.S. federal taxes, serve in the U.S. military, and defend the nation for the benefit of all, why don’t they have the right to vote for the president of the United States?
With steady advocacy and action, change is imminent for the Island of Enchantment and its residents. While the pace of the relief progress and rebuilding efforts in Puerto Rico is not matching the overwhelming need, the voices of the people, and their champions like Ricky Martin, remain strong, loud, and unwavering.

You should too.",2016-12-20,VOICES,"The end of the year is always bittersweet. It’s a time where many usually look back on the last 12 months and reflect on all they’ve accomplished (or not). For some it is a time of relief as they can release all of the funk and bad juju of the year, and for others it is another opportunity to look ahead and start over. I’ve been having a ton of mixed feelings about this past year. I’ve grown as a person, both professionally and personally, but the most critical revelation of the year for me is I discovered I am a social justice activist, a label that I never claimed before.
Between the Presidential election, the financial crisis in Puerto Rico, the killings of unarmed people of color, the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the humanitarian crisis in the Syrian town of Aleppo I found myself more involved and more vocal on domestic and international issues than I’d ever been. Despite all my personal achievements, this year I found there’s so much going on in the world at large and there’s always so much more of ourselves we can give.
I found myself on the front lines of protest marches . I found myself making calls to my local senators and elected officials in protest of Trump’s selection of certain cabinet members. I was writing articles and gathering resources where others could do the same in their states. As an anti-Trump critic I became extremely vocal and passionate about the Presidential election, often times bumping heads and engaging in heated arguments with my father, a self-proclaimed Trump supporter. I was fist pumping, yelling, and hash tagging #staywoke all across my social media platforms. This past year has ignited a fire in me I didn’t realize I had.
I don’t know if it’s because I’m getting older or because I have two young children, but the state of the world matters significantly more to me now. It matters to me the legacy I leave behind for my children and for their children (when that time comes). I understand we are responsible now for creating the world of the future which is why I think I’ve become extremely passionate about so many issues. I can’t sit back and leave the work to someone else. None of us can. We each are responsible for the state of this world through our actions and through what we contribute.
In recent weeks we have been bombarded with the massacre of human lives happening in Aleppo and as I sit in the safety of my office writing this article my heart breaks knowing that somewhere in that city there is a child alone, who has been separated from his/her family, possibly hiding, and frightened to death of being killed. I think about that and it breaks me to pieces because this cannot be the world we live in. With all that I would like to do to help, I feel helpless and hopeless. I think about my own children and how grateful I am that although the United States has its own issues we live in a country where bombings in the streets isn’t part of our everyday reality. It’s recognizing this privilege that inspires me to do more. I think we all should be doing more.
Though our Presidential election seemed to further divide our country I really believe this world is at a point in history where we can no longer be divided, but instead try to find some common ground for the sake of all humanity. If we continue to only act in selfish and opportunistic ways we will find ourselves left with very little hope, very little faith, and not much of a global future. For 2017, I commit to be louder, bolder, and a champion for unity and change. You should too.

The Nuyorican heroine already stands out among other comic book superheroes thanks to her proud afro-Latina roots. Now her best friend Lauren “La La” Liu, who is Chinese-Dominican, is going a step further in showing the immense diversity of the Latino community.
Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez told The Huffington Post in May that he created La Borinqueña, whose real name is Marisol de la Luz, as a “symbol of hope” for the Puerto Rican diaspora. When the boricua isn’t flying off to a new adventure, she and her childhood best friend La La are studying earth and environmental sciences at Columbia University. 
La La’s character came to life in part because the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American center commissioned Miranda-Rodriguez to create a bigger storyline for the Chinese-Dominican character. 
“As I’m independently publishing my comic book, I couldn’t afford to give La La Liu a bigger part in the first issue,” he told HuffPost on Thursday. “She was originally just a small character. However, with the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center CTRL+ALT exhibition that debuted on November 12 and 13, I’ve seen the amazing response that she’s been getting from women in general who love her story, her look and her attitude. I look forward to making her a larger part of the La Borinqueña series should I have a strong enough response to help me work on a second issue.”
La La’s family immigrated from the Barrio Chino in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to New York City, according to Miranda-Rodriguez. And it was via the friendship La La’s mother formed with Marisol’s mother, Dr. Flor de la Luz Rojas, that the two girls became childhood friends. 
La La is particularly fond of her long board, which she is always riding down the hills of her neighborhood, and her favorite book is The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.
“Junot Díaz is an old friend of mine since we were young activists back in the 1990s,” Miranda-Rodriguez said, pointing to a detail in the illustration below. “The Oscar Wao graphic on the skateboard is a nod to our longtime friendship!”
La La may not be superhuman like her best friend, but Miranda-Rodriguez recently told Mitú the character has “the tenacity and cojones of a badass young woman from Washington Heights” despite having no special powers. 
The creator of La Borinqueña, whose worked with Marvel and DMC comics in the past, also feels personally connected with bringing an Asian-Latino character to life.
“The beauty of being Latino is how diverse we are as a people,” he told HuffPost recently. “As we celebrate our heritage, it’s important to also recognize the Asian diaspora. My wife is Korean-American and together we are raising a Korean/Puerto Rican son, or Koricua like I like to call him. My goddaughter is Chinese American raised by Filipino/Puerto Rican/Dominican parents. Asian Latinx are part of my own family as are Afro Latinx. Therefore, given the chance to tell my own stories, I wanted to create a character that many of us could relate to.”
Miranda-Rodriguez said he spoke to writer Carmen Rita Wong about her own Dominican-Chinese upbringing and other Asian Latinos in his life to create La La. 
La Borinqueña first full length issue is set to be released online on Dec. 22, the anniversary of the Puerto Rican flag. La La’s story will be reprinted as part of the debut.

But as the dust has settled, many have begun to realize Ms. Lopez is not the ""breath of fresh air"" she was thought to be.",2015-04-02,VOICES,"Last November, an unconventional candidate with little political experience was elected to represent the East San Fernando Valley in the California State Assembly. The election of Patricia ""Patty"" Lopez was noteworthy to many in the community because she beat a sitting, well-financed incumbent in a David and Goliath-esque battle. But as the dust has settled and the noteworthiness of her unexpected victory has dried up, many in the San Fernando Valley and elsewhere have begun to realize Ms. Lopez is not the political ""breath of fresh air"" she was thought to be. 
The notion that Patty Lopez is an outsider -- unbeholden to the Democratic political machine -- is misguided. Instead, the indicators point to a larger conservative-leaning political strategy behind her -- one that was able to go largely unnoticed and undisclosed under the guise of political inexperience. Ms. Lopez' conservative alliances, weak stance on the issues, and lack of campaign transparency suggest a more extreme type of ""Democrat"" -- much further to the right of her corporately-aligned moderate colleagues. 
During her campaign, Patty Lopez surrounded herself with Tea Party-aligned conservatives, even seeking campaign advice from Republicans, as reported in the Sacramento Bee. One of her biggest supporters and advisors is David Hernandez, a 9-time Northeast SF Valley political candidate who has had affiliations with the Minutemen, a right-wing anti-immigrant organization that promotes hate and violence against Latinos. Perplexingly, Ms. Lopez also ran her campaign alongside Republican Senate candidate Ricardo Benitez, who she later hired on as staff and has spoken for her at events. Lopez-supporters David Hernandez and Ricardo Benitez are individuals that actively advance issues and causes that go directly against the economic and social interests of the Latino community. And the fact that until recently, Ms. Lopez has had close and public associations with these individual is not only inconceivable but deeply shameful. 
Assemblymember Lopez' district is heavily immigrant and has remained a Democratic Latino stronghold for decades. This history and constituency make it surprising and concerning to me that voters would knowingly elect a candidate with anti-immigrant Republican campaign advisors and staff, and a deeply entrenched association with a well-known member of the Minutemen. Upon hearing compounding allegations and community concerns, it is evident that Ms. Lopez and her advisors have misinformed voters.
In her first few months in office, Assemblywoman Lopez has already been fined for failing to disclose campaign donations, so we cannot yet fully say who has provided her with financial support but it is evident that right-wing operatives and failed Republican politicians have given her advice. Without a strong platform and public stance on the issues, who is to say who Ms. Lopez will be beholden to? 
Most recently, I have been hearing community leaders calling on Assemblywoman Lopez to resign. I have also heard the word recall. A long-time parent organizer and community member who has known and worked with Ms. Lopez lamented, ""This should have been a moment we should have been proud of -- an immigrant, a woman, a Latina. But the sad truth is that it's a total disappointment."" Ms. Imelda Mendoza went on to say, ""I met Patty many, many years ago volunteering for the Los Angeles Unified School District and the truth is that her views are totally extreme and anti-immigrant, completely out of touch with the needs of our kids, of our schools, and of our community. We need someone that can represent us well, that really loves the community,"" added Mendoza. 
This was one of several community members that I spoke with, all of whom volunteered information about Patty's inexperience and questionable alliances. If all of the emerging allegations and calls for accountability continue to escalate, it is unclear how much the community will tolerate from this new political leader with close ties to anti-immigrant and conservative forces that go directly against the interests of her district. All the indications point to the beginning of a long and tough road ahead for Ms. Lopez.

534,LATINO VOICES,Finding Faces To Lead The Latino Movement,"Daisy Prado, ContributorWeekday nonprofit professional. Weekend activist.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/finding-faces-to-lead-the-latino-movement_us_59de7f66e4b0cee7b9549d8d,Is centralized leadership the best route to achieving human rights for all?,2017-10-13,VOICES,"Dolores Huerta. Hers is a name left out of our high school textbooks, but a name that still lingers like a whisper in our history. She is one of the most riveting activists, not only in Latino history, but also in our nation’s history. Co-founder of the first farm workers union, all the while raising 11 children, Dolores relentlessly fought and continues to fight for social and labor justice for all.
Watching the story of her life in the intimate film “Dolores” sparked the question: how has leadership in the Latino movement shifted? The film showed how Dolores’s ferocity inspired people to mobilize and fight for equality. Throughout the film, high-profile activists and leaders such as Angela Davis and Gloria Steinem raved about Dolores and what she meant to the movement.
With technology ― particularly, social media ― a surge of young Latino activists are more connected than ever before, making it easier for us spread action and awareness. What did not come with this surge was a face to the movement. Faces like Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez.
It’s not hard to recognize powerhouses within the black community such as Representative Maxine Waters, commentator Angela Rye, former NFL player Colin Kaepernick, Shaun King and Van Jones to name a few. And let us not forget the cream of the crop: the Obamas.
Which begs the question: does our community of 57 million Latinos need to have highly-publicized figures in order to make progress?
Although there aren’t many Latinos who are popular within mainstream media it does not mean we don’t have leadership within our community.
That leadership is in Jorge Ramos, one of the most trusted journalists of all time, broadcasting our stories for decades into the homes of millions across the United States and around the world.
It’s in San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz Soto for standing up to the president and demanding relief for our people (American citizens might I add) who were affected by Hurricane Maria, all the while wading through sewage and searching for survivors.
It’s in the 800,000 Dreamers tirelessly fighting for their right to not only to stay in this country that they call their home, but also to be respected as human beings.
It’s in Undocumedia, a platform that uses digital and social media to highlight the stories of undocumented immigrants and raised money to cover over a hundred DACA renewal applications.
It’s in Carmen Perez, the national co-chair of the Women’s March, which was one of the largest marches in American history and drew in over five million people across the globe.
It’s in the Latino who bravely pushes through their career in a new city to carve a space for other Latinos to follow and feel more comfortable than they did themselves.
It’s in the first-generation college student who is pulling all-nighters to study, trying to become the first in their family to graduate with a degree.
That leader is within you and me.
A movement relies on more than one person. Even Dolores Huerta had the entire pueblo rallying behind her. All we need to do is look within ourselves to lead our movement.

It makes it kind of lovely that even today she is still so… loved.” He would know.

In a Washington Post magazine interview published on Friday, Kumar spoke about her work with the nonpartisan organization, the growth of the Latino population and possible Latino candidates for the White House. 
Actress Rosario Dawson and Kumar founded Voto Latino, an organization dedicated to increasing civic engagement among young Latinos, in 2004. For it’s 10-year anniversary, the organization is hosting four Power Summits across the country in New York City, Miami, San Antonio and San Jose. 
During their chat, the Washington Post’s Josh Heim first asked Kumar if there were currently any “good presidential candidates.” 
“Well, if she wasn’t a justice I would say Sonia Sotomayor — she is such a rock star because she represents so much of the Latino community and the aspirations of immigrants and Americans. And she tells the truth in a way that is refreshing,” Kumar said.
When Heim pressed for any other names, the executive director of Voto Latino says she doesn’t think there are any fully formed candidates in the Latino community just yet. 
“If you look at who people have been mentioned as presidential candidates, from Marco Rubio to a VP candidate, Julian Castro to Ted Cruz, all of them are under 45,"" Kumar added. ""So, our presidential candidate for America is still in the making, and that’s what makes it exciting.""
Several celebrities have joined the Voto Latino cause over the years, including singer Demi Lovato and actor Wilmer Valderrama. During the New York City Power Summit in April, the “That 70’s Show” star explained why it’s so important for Latinos to be engaged as citizens. 
“A lot of what's happening is that a lot of communities have an opinion, but they don't walk it -- they don't speak it,” Valderrama told Latina magazine. “They only yell it, you know? They only vent. I think that this is the opportunity... So, the idea is if you're a minority -- it doesn't matter if you're Indian, Asian, Latino, African American -- you have a duty to speak your mind and actually shape the government that you need for tomorrow. If you don't speak your mind, you can't complain about the change that hasn't happened. But, if you can be part of the change, then you can enjoy the government that you've been waiting for.”
The next Voto Latino Power Summit will be hosted in San Antonio in September.

In a blistering statement published Tuesday in Spanish on Univision.com, 67 scientists, historians, award-winning authors, lawyers and more from the United States, Latin America and Spain signed a statement denouncing Trump's behavior and asking the American people to ""stop tolerating his absurd views."" 
Among the most controversial comments and actions cited in the statement include Trump's remarks on Mexican immigrants -- who he called criminals, ""rapists"" and drug traffickers in June -- and his removal of prominent journalist Jorge Ramos from a press conference in August. 
""His hate speech appeals to the lowest of sentiments: like xenophobia, machismo, political intolerance and religious dogmatism,"" reads the statement, translated by The Huffington Post from Spanish. ""All of which inevitably is reminiscent of past campaigns aimed against ethnic groups, which resulted in the death of millions of people. In fact, physical aggressions against Hispanics and calls to prohibit the use of Spanish in public have already begun.""
""Mr. Trump’s verbal attacks are not based on statistics or proven facts but on his very personal and unfounded opinion,"" the statement continues. ""He not only disrespects immigrant Hispanics (later there could be other ethnic groups) but exhibits a dangerous attitude toward his opponents, who he portrays as stupid and weak.""
The group also states that some of Trump's political proposals, which include building a massive wall along the Mexican border and deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants, would be detrimental to the United States. 
""Mr. Trump’s behavior is unworthy of a candidacy to the presidency of one of the most powerful countries in the world,"" they write at the end of the statement."" We condemn his behavior and hope that the American people will stop tolerating his absurd views.""
The statement's extensive list of signees includes Pulitzer Prize-winning author Junot Díaz, Oscar-winning Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu, Nobel Prize-winning author Mario Vargas Llosa and Mexican actors Diego Luna and Demián Bichir.
Ricky Martin wrote a similarly scathing op-ed posted on Univision.com in August. In his piece, the Puerto Rican singer urged Latinos to unite against Donald Trump.

539,LATINO VOICES,Trump's Deportation Plan Will Affect Generations Of Immigrants,"Joseph Morales, ContributorEducator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-and-daca-the-big-picture_us_587d18bce4b03e071c14ff0d,The effects of our immigration and citizenship laws go on for generations.,2017-01-16,VOICES,"On day one of his administration, President-elect Trump has vowed to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), a 2012 executive action by President Obama that authorizes short-term work permits and shields undocumented youths from deportation. A recent report at Reuters suggests Trump’s transition team is now moving forward with this plan.
Voiding DACA will have an immediate impact on individuals and their families. Children could be pulled out of school, higher education will no longer be within reach for many young adults, and “sanctuary spaces,” offering both legal and moral protection, may become a means of last defense.
As an educator, I can’t help but wonder how many generations will be affected by this in the future. I’ve personally experienced how the effects of our immigration and citizenship laws can affect families for generations.
My grandmother was stripped of her U.S. citizenship; she never went to school. My father grew up in a home with undocumented parents; he dropped out of high school. Years later, I am still playing catch up; I’m a third-generation Mexican American who is finally a first-generation college graduate.
My Nana’s undocumented life – despite having been born in the US – scarred my father and now colors my own experience half a century later.
Like my Nana, many of our nation’s undocumented are “Americans in their heart, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper.” If President-elect Trump goes forward with his plan to deport people, chances are the effects of this decision will harm families for generations.
My Nana’s Undocumented Life
My Nana’s life story is not that uncommon. She was born in Southern California, got married, and together with her husband worked and raised a family.
But taking a closer look, her story becomes a cautionary tale. My Nana was born in a work camp for Mexican railroad workers. Because of a discriminatory law, she lost her U.S. citizenship when she married a Mexican migrant. For most of her life, she was undocumented – a woman without a country – all while living and working in her native state, California.
She was one of the many women who were considered “disposable citizens” under the 1907 Expatriation Act. Per the statute, which deprived women of independent citizenship, “Any American woman who marries a foreigner shall take the nationality of her husband.”
For her, our nation’s immigration and citizenship laws must have seemed like a baffling maze of xenophobia and gender discrimination.
My Nana would see the US enter WWI, WWII, and the Korean War before calling the INS to ask about her lost citizenship. In a letter dated December 28, 1951, an official wrote back: “It would appear that you again became a citizen of the United States on July 2, 1940, in accordance with legislation effective that date (54 Stat. 715m 8 U.S.C. 9(a)).”
By that time, she had lived through several waves of anti-Mexican hysteria, including the infamous deportation raids in Los Angeles County during the Herbert Hoover Administration. In her home, like in other Mexican American homes, Hoover was despised for taking out Depression-era angst on Mexicans.
Is it any wonder my Nana kept the letter from the INS in her purse? It was her proof of U.S. citizenship.
Hoover Tower
Years ago, after my Nana passed away, my father came to visit me while I was a visiting scholar at Stanford University. He asked me about the campus’ most visible architectural landmark, the Hoover Tower. Most parents would feel proud if their child were at a prestigious university. Yet, as I explained that the tower was named after Stanford alumnus Herbert Hoover, my father became upset and said: “That #$@&%*! tried to deport my mother!”
I had always known about my Nana’s story. But it wasn’t until that moment that I realized the depth of pain caused by these policies.
Striking is the amount of time she was forced to live without U.S. citizenship: she was legally expelled for 26 years plus another 11 years while she didn’t know her status. Had her husband been racially eligible for citizenship the Cable Act might have cut her expulsion to eight years.
Getting an education was impossible for my Nana. When my father dropped out of high school, it must have seemed natural, considering neither of his parents had ever gone to school. For better or worse, this history has profoundly shaped me as a scholar and a professional.
Election 2016
Before the election, undocumented students relied on a complex web of federal, state, and local policies to enroll at universities. Immediately after the election, campuses across the nation vowed to support undocumented students. The bottom line is, like Hoover, President-elect Trump has a narrow view of who counts as “Americans.”
In December, I became an ally for AB540 and undocumented students at UC Irvine. Seeing today’s post-election climate through my family’s history, it was important for me to learn how to support our students.
To be sure, some will say: “Get over it.” But this is my family’s experience. These policies have left a mark. They’ve had an adverse ripple effect over time.
Likewise, this isn’t to suggest that Trump’s proposed policy is unique. As relatives in both my mother’s and father’s families can attest, the threat of deportation has been a mainstay for many generations of Mexican Americans, whether one has labored as a bracero during the 1950s, as my uncle did, or one has had to navigate SB 1070, the most recent in a long line of anti-Mexican laws in Arizona, as my mother’s cousins do today.
Recently, the President-elect has said he will “work something out” for Dreamers. But his pick for attorney general suggests otherwise. In the Senate hearings on Jeff Sessions’ nomination, the nominee has made it clear that the Trump administration “plans to throw DACA immigrants to the wolves.”
The effects of our immigration and citizenship laws go on for generations. I hope, as the inauguration draws near, that President-elect Trump will take a moment and consider this.

540,MONEY,2014 Tax Season Starting Very Soon,"Mark A. Steber, Contributor
Chief Tax Officer, Jackson Hewitt Tax Service",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2014-tax-season-starting_us_5b9db58fe4b03a1dcc8bcbe8,About 110 million taxpayers got a tax refund last year -- that is about three out of four filers or 75 percent of all taxpayers.  A tax refund is a refund of your money -- getting it sooner is always better than getting it later.,2013-12-10,BUSINESS,"There was a recent announcement by the IRS that due to the last government shutdown a few months ago, the IRS may need a bit of extra time to get ready before starting up this year. The IRS needs the extra time to check tax forms, form instructions, run checks and diagnostics on computers and software, and basically ensure all tax administration systems are up and running as needed before tax returns will be processed -- time that was lost during the government shutdown. Accordingly in the coming days, the IRS will formally announce the start of tax season, and it may be a bit later than originally scheduled. 
In reality, this IRS start date has very little impact on a taxpayer's ability to get started on his or her tax return: getting organized, preparing and even filing an annual tax return -- Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. It is always a best practice to get started on your taxes as soon as possible. The IRS is only considering a delay of one to two weeks from the original projected start date for IRS processing of 2013 tax returns. The window for IRS accepting and processing tax returns ranges from January 28, 2014 to as late as February 4, 2014. Those dates are when the IRS will actually process an individual tax return. You can start your data collection, and subsequently your tax return preparation, as soon as you have your current year information, including your W-2 and any other forms or records you may need. 
So why is it a best practice to file earlier rather than later?
To start with, about 110 million taxpayers got a tax refund last year -- that is about three out of four filers or 75 percent of all taxpayers. A tax refund is a refund of your money -- getting it sooner is always better than getting it later.  Refund crime and identity theft is a big problem and getting bigger every year. Filing your tax return early can help secure your information. Filing early helps prevent identity theft for you. The IRS will take a longer period of time to process a return from a Social Security number that has been submitted more than once. While filing early helps ensure your tax return is filed and processed, the IRS will notify you if they suspect your Social Security number has been compromised.  Finally, if you have your taxes prepared and file your tax return early and you find that there is a problem or surprise issue, you will have more time to fix it or find the information needed long before the filing deadline of April 15. Filing early gives you more time to solve problems or manage issues should they arise. 
In summary, even if the IRS does start a week or so later this year, it is in your best interest to get started early -- as early as you can. Locate and organize your tax information, including current year tax documents and prior-year tax return for reference, prepare and file that tax return and get that refund so you can enjoy it.

LearnVest is a program for your money.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-youre-not-actually-poor_us_5b9c3578e4b03a1dcc7d1b39,I am sick of hearing about the trials and tribulations of the middle class.,2012-08-30,BUSINESS,"People have a lot of opinions about money.
In our ""Money Mic"" series, we hand over the podium to someone with a strong opinion on a financial topic. These are their views, not ours, but we welcome your responses.
Today, LearnVest reader Kimberlee Stiens explains what she thinks it means to actually be poor--and why most of us aren't.
I am sick of hearing about the trials and tribulations of the middle class.
Politicians constantly talk about strengthening the middle class (which is shrinking) or accuse their opponents of waging war on it, when I think the middle class, on the whole, has little cause to complain.
I've seen women here on LearnVest and in my daily life complain about making $40,000 a year, saying that's not enough to support themselves (to which I would add: ""in the lifestyle to which they've become accustomed"").
The poverty line in America is $22,350 a year ... for a family of four. In 2010, a full 15% of Americans lived below this threshold. Most American adults will live below that threshold for at least one year of their lives.
That's why I think we need to change the way we talk about being ""poor"" or ""middle class.""
I Know Because I Grew Up Poor I became middle class for the first time ever only about a year ago. I grew up fairly poor, my father being generally unable to keep a job and my mother not having legal standing to work in this country. (Complicated story, but she's Canadian and only recently got U.S. residency--I think she always intended to go back there.) I graduated college with some $60,000 in student loans and a temporary internship position for a congressional campaign paying $250 a week. At least it came with free housing.
I graduated with a degree in political science and wasn't sure what I wanted to do, but was mostly looking for admin office jobs. When I started college, I harbored the same illusions as the rest of my graduating class: We were freshmen in 2004, when almost all undergrads could count on getting a job after graduation, and we finished college in the middle of the Great Recession.
After the congressional campaign, I worked at a fast food restaurant for two years while constantly applying for office jobs. I made no more than $10 an hour, with no benefits. So when I managed to get an internship in Washington, D.C. working for the Marijuana Policy Project, I jumped on it. I worked for $9 an hour until I was promoted to my first full-time, salaried position as a membership assistant, at $35,000 a year, with paid vacation and health benefits.
Finally, at age 25, I was middle class, but I didn't know it yet.
It's Our Choices That Define Us I work at a non-profit, a sector where salaries are notoriously ""low."" Yet most of my peers here make at least $30,000 yearly. We all have health care and other benefits.
After I started my job, I realized that, for the first time, my life was no longer about what I could and couldn't afford. It was about how I chose to spend my money. I could no longer blame the externalities of a cruel world for keeping me down.
Now I'm the office manager and executive assistant to our executive director at the same organization where I had my first internship. I make $39,000 a year (I negotiated my raise!), and live in Washington, DC, one of the most expensive housing markets in the country. I'm paying off my student loans, and I'm doing fine.
Given that I encounter more than one panhandler on my walk to work each day, it seems delusional that anyone complains that $35,000 a year makes them ""poor."" I live in D.C. and work on the Hill, where there's a culture of made-up poverty. Many staffers work long hours and live in shared housing, but they all tend to make salaries of at least $25,000 with health benefits (and they have plenty of opportunity to move up after they put in their time!). Everyone complains about being poor, but then goes out to drinks each week.
It's not that they have it easy. They just don't understand how much easier they have it than some.
Try Another Perspective I'm not trying to diminish anyone's experience. I know that dipping below a standard of living you've always enjoyed will feel pretty crappy. My point is that, comparatively speaking, it's not actually all that crappy. Many middle class people, particularly those who have never really been poor, don't seem to see that there's a whole other side to the economy that they never experience, like this writer who struggles to pay for friends' weddings. I've met people who have spent 20 years in food service, with no health care, no bonuses and usually kids to support.
There are middle class people who say they just can't live in D.C. or New York City on $40,000 a year, but there are also people in those same places living on minimum wage. Take a look at the invisible people around you who make your life tick--your cleaners, the person making your drinks, your interns--and imagine how they make ends meet.
It's a choice that you make to feel disadvantaged. If you make $33,000 a year, the truth is, you are actually in the top 50% of wage-earners.
Everyone can, and should, do a little more to manage their finances better. And while studies may show that we don't feel truly comfortable or secure in our finances until we reach between $50,000 and $75,000 a year, it's a bit dramatic for people to feel anything other than lucky when depositing their salaried paychecks.

Expert information about credit scoring, credit reporting and ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-rent-with-bad-cred_us_5b9decbee4b03a1dcc8edd52,Don't avoid the elephant in the room. Address your bad credit frankly and honestly.,2014-03-21,BUSINESS,"By AJ Smith, Credit.com
We've all heard about the importance of your credit scores when it comes to buying a home. But credit is important for renting as well. Some landlords won't rent to people with low credit scores. This doesn't mean you can't rent a home or apartment, though. There are some ways to get around this and prove to a potential landlord that you can afford the home and will make payments on time.
1. Find a Co-Signer
You may have bad credit, but if you have a friend or family with good credit, ask them to help you out. (But know they would be doing you a huge favor; adding someone's name to your lease is a big benefit for you and carries significant risk for them.) A co-signer is someone who signs the lease with you, taking on the legal responsibility to ensure the rent gets paid. A co-signer with good credit should ease your potential landlord's concerns. 
2. Offer a Larger Deposit
If you want to show your landlord that you won't skip out on payments, you can offer a higher deposit. Often landlords require first and last month's rent when you move in. If you can save up more and give them a few month's rent upfront, they may overlook your poor credit scores. Be careful, though, because while this offers the landlord more security, it offers you less.
3. Have a Personal Referral
If your credit is bad but you have a good rental history, ask a former landlord to vouch for you. Hearing from a previous landlord that you have paid your rent on time in the past can carry a lot of weight with a potential landlord. He or she may be willing to overlook that low credit score and accept your application.
4. Talk About It
Don't avoid the elephant in the room. Address your bad credit frankly and honestly. You can explain why your scores are low and why that doesn't accurately reflect your ability to routinely pay your rent. Landlords are aware of the difficult economy of the past few years and may appreciate your honesty.
5. Find a No-Credit-Check Rental
Not all rentals require a credit check. Look for smaller landlords who don't do a credit check as part of the application process. It may require some more legwork, but it can be worth it.
6. Improve Your Credit
Even if you do find a rental with bad credit, immediately begin working to improve your credit for next time. Make your payments on time. Reduce your debt. Monitor your credit reports, which you can get for free from each of the major credit bureaus once a year, and your credit scores. (You can use a free tool like Credit.com'sCredit Report Card, which updates two of your credit scores every month.) Make yourself a more attractive rental candidate so you don't have to worry about it when you move.

Your portfolio may be less risky. If you have a diversified portfolio you probably took,2014-01-27,BUSINESS,"Do you have performance envy?
You may be feeling some envy toward the numbers the major indices put up for 2013. It never fails. We have a great year in the equity markets, and advisors everywhere are having the performance envy conversation.
What is the performance envy conversation you ask?
It's the conversation where an advisor is reporting performance numbers for the previous year. Usually good, solid performance numbers. However, the portfolio return numbers are less than what the Dow, S&P and NASDAQ returned. Inevitably investors will compare their portfolio to these indices. Right or wrong.
To be specific, here are the indices returns for 2013:
 +25.57% Dow Jones Industrial Average +34.73% NASDAQ +28.81% S&P 500
So now that you've oogled the 2013 indices returns, you've probably done the mental comparison to your own portfolio already. It's about right now when you start to say...""Hey I didn't do that well."" So I would like to give you a few reasons that you did not match or exceed what the indices returned. Here goes:
 1. You own a different portfolio than an index. That's right. You probably have other investments besides U.S. Large and Medium cap stocks. Your portfolio could contain things that are not present in equity indices, such as bonds, international investments and alternatives. Plus you don't just own the index, which then would be a fair performance comparison. The Dow for example consists of just 30 large U.S. stocks.
 2. Your portfolio has expenses. An index is just a collection of many different securities. It is not ""managed"" or traded. Therefore, it has no costs associated with it. As an investor, your portfolio may have internal costs or management fees. In addition, there may be trading costs for making changes to the portfolio. Why am I bringing this up? It does effect performance. Portfolio performance is reduced by the cost of running the portfolio.
3. Your portfolio may be less risky. If you have a diversified portfolio you probably took on less risk. Even if that portfolio was on the aggressive side. How can that be you ask? The indices consist of medium to large stocks. So that's one to two asset classes. In a diversified portfolio you may have a dozen or more asset classes. That will reduce the portfolio's volatility. Other asset classes in a diversified portfolio can often lower performance. However, these same asset classes could save your butt during a decline. These indices could dive bomb during a market correction more than your diversified portfolio. It's easy to have guts in a bull market.
It's easy to develop a case of performance envy after a phenomenal year like 2013. As an investor, remain focused on your goals. Are you getting portfolio returns that will satisfy your long-term financial planning goals? If you are, then don't worry about missing this extra return... and extra risk. On the flip side, don't tolerate underperformance of a portfolio either. If you liked my article, why not subscribe for free right here!

The Nasdaq Composite is an index of the common stocks and similar securities listed on the NASDAQ stock market and is considered a broad indicator of the performance of stocks of technology companies and growth companies. The return and principal value of the investments will fluctuate so that, when redeemed, they may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Even if you convert a credit,2014-04-08,BUSINESS,"Credit cards are a useful tool for managing purchases, building credit, and reaping rewards point, cash back, or travel points. Unfortunately, the terms of credit cards change regularly, and a card which once had a great rewards program might not be as enticing as it once was.
Every year, it's a good idea to compare cards and ditch certain ones in the bunch. While you are busy preparing for spring cleaning around your house, take the time to do the same for your finances -- including your credit cards.
1. Do the math If you're enjoying the perks or credit card rewards from using a certain card, but it's costing you more in fees than the rewards are worth, it's probably time to rethink using that card. Perks and rewards like travel miles always come at some cost, but if the same benefits can be had for less through other programs, ditch the card.
2. Change in credit score When someone's credit score drops, it's entirely possible that a bank may change the terms of a credit card issued to them. The result is usually higher interest and annual fees. However, an uptick in one's credit rating isn't going to prompt the bank to upgrade the card.
If you've had a credit card for a long time and your credit score has improved, you may be eligible for a better offer, but you have to ask. Call the issuing bank and ask if you qualify for any better programs, or check to see if other companies have better deals.
3. New offers New credit card offers might be available that offer similar features and benefits to cards you currently carry, but may have a great introductory offer, like a low rate on balance transfers, bonus miles, or some other program to sweeten the deal. If you're planning on going after another card, be sure to call your current bank to see if they'll offer any incentives to keep you as a customer.
4. Changes in airline miles With airline mergers and a difficult market, many of the airline miles rewards programs have changed. Many customers are unhappy about changes to Delta's mileage rewards programs and are looking for other travel bonus alternatives.
Or, maybe you aren't flying as much and rewards based on frequent flyer mileage points aren't as interesting as cash back or shopping discount programs. If making it into a higher rewards status category with an airline mileage program isn't realistic this year, it might be time to rethink any credit cards you're carrying which offer miles.
Likewise, hanging on to a credit card you're unlikely to use isn't a great idea, since the company will eventually close an account with no activity, and paying annual fees for a card collecting dust isn't a wise use of money or a credit line, either.
A caveat It's important to remember that every time you apply for a new credit card, that information is calculated into your credit score. Too many inquiries into one's credit history in a short period of time can have a negative effect on your credit rating, so choose carefully and don't apply for every offer you find.
Also, if you do end up closing certain cards, be sure to read this article about the Pros and Cons of Canceling vs. Cutting Up Your Credit Cards.
Even if you convert a credit card into another one through an existing relationship with a bank, you might get a ping on your credit report. If you know what your credit score is before applying for a card, you can call in and ask about what the minimum score, income and other factors required to get into a different program before actually submitting the application.

It will just take time to reload the consumer debt pipeline.",2012-11-07,BUSINESS,"The latest statistics out of the United States courts show that bankruptcy filings are dropping. That's good news for consumers and bad news for companies that sell debt relief services.
According to filing data, the number of non-business bankruptcy filings for the same year-on-year period ending Sept. 30 has significantly dropped. Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing dropped from 1,036,950 to 874,337. That a decrease of almost 16 percent. Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings dropped from 417,530 to 375,521 -- a decrease of about 10 percent. Non-business bankruptcy filings in total were down from 1,467,221 to 1,261,140 -- a decrease of filings of 14 percent.
Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing as of Sept. 30, 2012 account for about 67 percent of all consumer bankruptcy filings. Clearly still the vast majority.
As of Sept. 30, 2012 the three states with the highest incidence of bankruptcy filings are: 
Nevada Tennessee Georgia
The three lowest are:
Alaska District of Columbia North Dakota
Even the month-on-month numbers look like there is a decreasing demand for consumer bankruptcy protection. This in combination with the historically low consumer credit default rates, certainly paints a picture that we may have reached the bottom of the decline for debt relief services and the demand to solve massive problem debt from the recession. The only residual factor would be if there remained a backlog of consumers that might still turn, in higher than usual numbers, to a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to deal with a still ongoing mortgage problem.
If we look at the change in demand for both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy from November 2011 to September 2012 we can see that in general the month on month reduction in demand for each chapter. As you can see in the accompanying chart, the demand in reduction is spending more time in the positive area. A positive number reflects a reduction in filings from the month before.

While it is doubtful that in the next decade or so we will see debt relief service demand at the levels experienced in 2009-2010, we should see a greater demand in the next three to five years. It will just take time to reload the consumer debt pipeline.
Even consumer default rates continue to decline. Numbers out from Discover just today state the default rate in September is down 1.5 percent from the same period a year ago.
As statistics begin to show us there is an increased demand and use of unsecured consumer credit and rebounding consumer confidence, it will signal a return to people loading up on debt again. This will lead to a greater demand for debt relief services in the future. But the latest statistics out from the Federal Reserve today show that revolving credit decreased at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent, while non-revolving credit increased 6.5 percent.
We need to keep our eyes on the growing balances of essentially secured private student loan debt as part of non-revolving debt. As those levels increase it will prevent consumers from indulging in as much unsecured credit as before. This will put a damper on consumption and the need for debt relief services like credit counseling and debt settlement.

Personal Finance Expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-charitable-giving-can_us_5b9c7d46e4b03a1dcc7f2129,"Have you ever thought about the gift of donating to a charity or a cause instead? Or better yet, have you ever thought about how donating to a charity can help improve your finances?",2012-11-07,BUSINESS,"It's about that time of the year again. One of the biggest shopping days is just a few weeks ahead of us: Black Friday and Cyber Monday. As the holiday season comes around the corner, it's easy to lose track of your finances when we see bright red sale signs every store we go to. 
As a young successful entrepreneur, I'll be the first to admit that I spoiled myself with all the new gadgets, clothes, and gifts for friends and family. I stood countless hours in line to get the ""doorbuster"" items and spent all night shopping trying to score the best deals. 
Donate To Improve Your Finances
Have you ever thought about the gift of donating to a charity or a cause instead? Or better yet, have you ever thought about how donating to a charity can help improve your finances? I know it sounds counter intuitive to think that giving money away can improve your finances, but you'll be surprised. Here are three ways on how donating can actually help:
• One reason why most Americans fall into debt is the difficulty of separating your needs vs wants. It's a skill set that seems obvious at first glance, but difficult to execute. Why not donate your holiday budget towards charity? In doing so, you'll have to fight the temptation of spoiling yourself on luxuries. Fight the urge to spend money on unnecessary gifts! Fight the urge to buy items just because it's on sale! You can't spend money that you don't have right? One of the greatest financial lessons I've learned over the years is to put priorities first before pleasure. If you can master this art, you're already one step ahead of improving your finances.
• If you're not in the best financial shape, the thought of donating can be a catalyst for you to start thinking about your finances. The first thing that comes to mind should be, ""How much can I afford to donate? $25? $50? $100? ""It's something that requires thought for most people. For example, if you decided that you could afford $50 in donations, you may also begin to think about how you can save $50 in the next few weeks. Perhaps you'll cut down on dining out or cancel the weekend partying with your friends. The mere thought about finding ways to reduce and/or eliminate some expenses is a huge step in improving your finances.
• And last but not least, donating money for a cause reminds us that no matter how bad our financial situation can be, there are millions of people who'd like to be in our shoes. Instead of focusing on material objects and what you think you want, think about how fortunate you are compared to other people. It gives us encouragement and hope that we can face any curve ball life throws at you. No one said it would be easy to reach your goals right? It takes dedication, persistence, and determination to reach all financial goals. 
Is Donating a Lost Cause?
I know some of you may be thinking that donating is a lost cause. I felt the same way. Big non-profit charities have huge overhead expenses: management salary, operational costs, and even marketing. For every dollar you donate, only a fraction goes towards charity while the rest goes towards operational expenses. I'm a huge believer in donating to a specific cause or project. 
If I ever decide to donate money to a charity, I want to make sure that every dollar is going towards a good cause as opposed to paying an executive's salary. One of my favorite charities to donate to is an organization called Givology, which was awarded the top rated non-profit in 2012. Givology is a 100 percent volunteer-run organization that connects donors to students and grassroots projects around the world. You can select a student or a project and donate directly to their cause. It's a rewarding feeling knowing that every single dollar is going towards a charitable cause.
Another one of my favorite non-profits is Kiva. Kiva is a micro lending platform to connect donors to entrepreneurs in third world countries. Donors get paid back with interest overtime. One of the best gifts you can give to the less fortunate is the opportunity that we were all once given.
Donating your money isn't going to magically improve your finances, however, reaching your long-term financial goals is a long road that requires precise planning. If you can separate your needs versus wants, find ways to trim your expenses, and have a burning desire to reach your goals, you've taken a huge first step.

President, State Budget Solutions",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-real-pension-crisis_us_5b9c0769e4b03a1dcc7bde8c,"A new report shows that the public pension picture is much grimmer than official numbers projected. Drastic reforms, innovations and political courage are needed to put our states and municipalities back on the path to fiscal survival.",2012-07-24,BUSINESS,"A new report by State Budget Solutions shows that the public pension picture is much grimmer than official numbers projected.
When the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) recently reported that public pensions were underfunded by $885 billion, citizens were astonished that the public pension system had reached historic levels of debt. That figure, however, does not present an accurate view of the whole picture.
In fact, according to State Budget Solutions, the average public employee pension plan in the United States is only around 41 percent funded, while total unfunded liabilities as of 2011 are roughly $4.6 trillion. Unfunded liabilities are actually more than five times larger than the official estimate.
The disparity in numbers comes down to unrealistic assumptions by the GASB, leaving a ridiculously large sum for the taxpayers to bankroll. 
When calculating unfunded liabilities, the GASB ignored accounting standards used by economists that require that assumed return on pension fund investments be based on the fact that pension benefits are guaranteed. Public pension funds calculate future debt based on politicians' guesses about the rate of interest investments will earn and how quickly they will grow. Although governments do not have to include pension debt in their budgets, taxpayers must make up any difference between pension fund investment performance and promised benefits. 
State Budget Solution's report uses fair market value and risk-free investment returns to determine that the actual unfunded liabilities are $4.6 trillion. That amount more accurately reflects the value of promised benefits taxpayers must fund whether investments perform or not. 
The difference in numbers is important to not only economists but also to politicians and to the public at large. By understating the current pension debt, states overstate their budget health and make riskier investments that the state governments cannot afford. In addition, state legislatures do not take the problem seriously enough and procrastinate implementing reform. 
Legislators must understand that immediate action is desperately needed. Without government action, states, counties, cities and towns all over America will go bankrupt. That means essential public services must be cut, dedicated government workers laid off, disrupting or eliminating public health, safety and education. 
Aggressive pension reform is needed to avoid those drastic service cuts. Pension reform must include moving from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans, which are similar to the 401(k) plans offered by the private sector. Defined benefit plans guarantee specific levels of service regardless of cost, whereas defined contribution plans establish a fixed payment toward services. Instituting defined contribution plans would end the endless cost escalations of non-salary compensation. A move to defined contribution plans would reduce the risk to taxpayers, provide lawmakers with a reliable cost estimate for budgeting and give state workers control over their retirement funding.
Three cities have championed pension reform and done so without the prompt or push from a larger authority. Voters in San Diego and San Jose elected to enact pension reform that would save their cities millions of dollars and stabilize the rocky pension system. The mayor of Chicago has proposed a pension solution that includes a five-year increase in the retirement age, a 10-year cost of living adjustment (COLA) suspension, and a 1% yearly contribution increase over five years for current employees. These cities should serve as an example to the rest of the country, that reform can be accomplished. 
Status quo or incremental adjustments are not options for solving this crisis. Drastic reforms, innovations and political courage are needed to put our states and municipalities back on the path to fiscal survival.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman ordered offline Idealcorp.net and Survsonl.com, both of which are run by T. Crefideal Corp., in the alleged scam.
Not all mystery shopper programs are suspect. Many above-board retailers hire marketing research companies to evaluate service at their stores by hiring undercover shoppers.
But Schneiderman said the targeted websites were anything but legit. 
Here is how the swindle worked: victims were sent bogus checks for $2,000 and instructed to cash them and keep $300 as payment. Then they were to wire the remaining $1,700 overseas using Western Union and then rate how the company did in completing the transaction. But once the victim's bank identified the check as counterfeit, their $1,700 was gone and they were left liable for paying the money back.
""These scams are particularly insidious because they target individuals looking for ways to bolster their income in today's challenging job climate,"" Schneiderman said, according to Legal Newsline. ""While legitimate 'work from home' opportunities do exist, scammers who are simply stealing money under the guise of offering employment are on notice. Our office will continue to protect consumers and shut these bad actors down.""
Schneiderman warned consumers to be wary of any work-at-home job that seemed too good to be true. Often they are, he said, especially when they involve the transfer of funds using wire services such as Western Union or MoneyGram.

After an epic run in 2013, stocks have taken a breather to start the new year. After reaching a new high on January 15, the S&P 500 has corrected by 6 percent. If you read the recent headlines, you'd probably be scared stiff. It's no wonder that some people end up in the hospital. Just check some of these headlines out:

Everyone is worried about emerging markets, Fed tapering, rich valuations and weakening economic data. So far in 2014, U.S. listed ETF money flows are $15.4 billion in outflows. Five popular ETFs (SPY, EEM, IWM, VWO and QQQ) have seen almost $28 billion in redemptions. So is it time to sell?
Fear & Greed
Warren Buffett's famous rule is:
Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.
This seems to be a simple rule, but even Buffett admits that it is easier said than done. ""There is no comparison between fear and greed. Fear is instant, pervasive and intense. Greed is slower. Fear hits,"" Buffet told CNN.
An interesting investor sentiment indicator is called the Fear and Greed Index from CNN Money. Right now it is registering ""Extreme Fear.""

In Conclusion
You must decide whether the time is right to buy or sell. On the negative side, the hibernating bear (market) may be stirring after five years of slumber. While investor sentiment is fearful, it is nowhere near as fearful as 2008/9 or even 2011 for that matter. On the positive side, if you were bullish a few weeks ago, then you can surely find investment ideas that are much cheaper today.

What is not true is that you have to ""just get by"" financially in order to really live. You can really live right this very moment and save for your future.",2014-03-10,BUSINESS,"We all know that the Millennial generation got a bad break out of the gate: many of us graduated college and attempted to enter the workforce during the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. But now we're six years out from when the market crashed in 2008. The economy is recovering and more employers are hiring. 
And yet Generation Y is likely going to continue struggling financially for decades to come. We've got two major factors working against us: a massive load of (mostly) student loan debt and jobs that offered us low starting salaries, if we managed to get a job at all.
At first, a low starting salary doesn't sound like it would equate to a lifetime of financial difficulty. But here's the problem: when the economy is struggling and the job market is tight, salaries and wages drop. Any employers who are hiring suddenly have a vast pool of talent to pull from, and they can secure great workers at less cost to the company. When you have hundreds of candidates vying for one administrative assistant job, you're bound to find one competent person desperate enough to work for $10 an hour and no benefits. Why offer a $40,000 annual salary when there are recent grads begging for work and will accept $28,000? 
When the economy recovers, those starting salaries might recover, too. But that's no help to members of Generation Y who started low. It's hard to make up those initial losses, and the result is that Millennials continue to struggle financially. 
Oddly enough, however, there is a large corp of Gen Yers who seem to have embraced these troubles. They are romanticizing the idea of just getting by in your twenties and thirties, and instead of fighting to become more financially stable and secure, they're accepting as a fact that you're not supposed to stop living like a broke college student until you're like, I dunno, 40 or something, bro.
These are the Millennials who claim money is the root of all evil. They are the ones who excessively use #YOLO as an excuse to live without worrying about the future, because who knows? Tomorrow is promised to no one, guys! Better to live it up now and come within pennies of overdrawing your checking account every month on the off chance that you'll keel over dead in the next week.
These twenty- and thirty-somethings say those who are worried about making money are fools. That those seeking to build wealth are mindless slaves, destined to die without having really lived life. 
The YOLO Generation is the one that fails to see it is they who are slowly selling themselves into that slavery they claim the rest of us are victims of currently. They fail to see that the shackles of working yourself to death for a paycheck that they so fear are the only possible future life for them. They are happy to spend every last cent they have because their fiscal irresponsibility is justified by the fact that you only live once -- which is true, but that logic starts failing when people end up living a long, healthy life with no form of retirement savings.
The YOLO Generation has been fooled into thinking just getting by is a romantic notion and the only way to be truly free. They feel enlightened by their belief that money is evil. They do not understand that money is neither good nor evil, but rather a tool that can be leveraged to secure true freedom: financial independence. 
The YOLO Generation will continue to be complacent with just getting by instead of seeing that while Millennials have struggled with a unique set of problems, we've also been gifted with brand-new opportunities. With the rise of online businesses and the digital economy, there has never been a better time than now to become an independent freelancer or entrepreneur. But for the twenty-somethings who have bought into this twisted idea that making money for yourself is somehow bad are missing out on these incredible opportunities. 
The YOLO Generation will be happy to ignore the future reality they are facing: that without any form of savings, without any ability to make money for themselves, their only option is to continue working. Their only option is to continue slaving away for The Man, because when they are old and gray they will desperately need what they so earnestly reject now: money.
Yes, you only live once. That is an inescapable truth that applies to us all. What is not true is that you have to ""just get by"" financially in order to really live. You can really live right this very moment and save for your future. You can really live while working toward financial independence, which offers you the freedom to do what you want since it releases you from the obligation of working for a paycheck. You can really live and have enough money left over to invest and build wealth with if you prioritize your spending and value your experiences and relationships over material possessions. You can really live by taking charge of your career and starting your own side hustle or business instead of being complacent with the bare minimum salary that some employer will try to get away with offering. 
What the YOLO Generation got wrong is that there is nothing wrong about wanting to earn money and build wealth. In fact, that's a rather smart move -- and the sooner you start, the easier it is thanks to the power of compound interest. Wanting to increase your net worth does not make you greedy or imply that you're somehow failing to live while you're young. What it does mean is that you're establishing the ability to choose your own way in life instead of being shackled to working for someone else because you need a paycheck every week to continue ""just getting by.""

556,MONEY,Student Loan Debt: Senior Citizens Owe 4.2 Percent Of All Student Loan Debt,Bonnie Kavoussi,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/student-loan-debt-senior-citizens_us_5b9b8675e4b03a1dcc785171,It's not just twenty-somethings that are carrying the weight of the student loan debt crisis. Many seniors are barely getting,2012-04-02,BUSINESS,"It's not just twenty-somethings that are carrying the weight of the student loan debt crisis.
In fact, a sizable chunk of nation's student loan debt is held by senior citizens--many of whom cannot afford to pay off the debt. 
Two million seniors in the U.S. who are age 60 and over have student loan debt, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. These seniors owe 4.2 percent of all student loan debt, or $36.5 billion in student loans. (H/t The Washington Post.)
11.2 percent of all student loan debt held by seniors is in default, according to the New York Fed.
Student loans can be a lifelong burden because people who declare bankruptcy cannot get student loan debt forgiven unless they can prove that their student loans are an ""undue hardship."" As a result, seniors can lose much of their Social Security income to student loan payments.
Many seniors are barely getting by, debt aside. Nearly half of all Baby Boomers are at risk of having to downgrade their living standards after retirement, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.
There are a number of reasons why seniors may still carry student loan debt.  While some are still paying off debt they took on in their 20s, others have gone back to school. They also may take on more debt by co-signing student loans for their children or grandchildren, according to The Washington Post. 
Because of the tough economy, Baby Boomers have gone back to school in droves to build their job skills. The number of U.S. college students between the ages of 50 and 64 surged 17 percent between the fall of 2007 and the fall of 2009, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics cited by the Columbus Dispatch. At Columbus State Community College, the number of students who are at least age 50 has spiked 81 percent since fall of 2007, according to the Columbus Dispatch.
Some have borrowed so much in student loans that it would require an unrealistic salary to pay the loans off. The top 1 percent of student loan borrowers owe at least $150,000 in student loans, according to the New York Fed. It would require a salary of at least $207,000 per year in order to pay off $150,000 in 10 years; $137,000 per year to pay off the loans in 20 years; $117,000 per year to pay off the loans in 30 years; or $109,000 per year to pay off the loans in 40 years, according to the FinAid calculator.
Total U.S. student loan debt now exceeds $1 trillion, topping credit card debt as the largest source of unsecured consumer debt in the U.S., according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Sara Collins, one of the study's authors",2012-06-08,BUSINESS,"* Health reform gave young adults coverage under parents
* 6.6 million young adults newly under parents' plans
* But young still struggle with medical bills, debt
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare reform likely enabled about 6.6 million young adults to join their parents' health insurance plans last year, a report found on Friday, though problems with medical bills and debt remained an issue.
President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare reform law allowed young adults - who previously had the nation's highest uninsured rate - to stay on their parents' private insurance plans through age 26.
This provision is perhaps the single most popular element of the Affordable Care Act, the nation's most sweeping healthcare legislation in nearly 50 years and Obama's signature domestic policy achievement.
Polls show Americans are sharply divided about the law ahead of a Supreme Court ruling on its constitutionality by the end of June.
The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit organization that analyzes healthcare issues, polled 1,863 adults between the ages of 19 to 25 and found 47 percent of them joined or remained on their parents' plans between November 2010 and November 2011.
This would translate into about 13.7 million young adults in the broader population.
Of those, 6.6 million would likely not have been able to be on their parents' plans before the law's passage, as they were not enrolled in college full time or had already graduated. Most insurance plans already allow full-time college students to stay on their parents' plans.
The results compared to a U.S. government survey that last year found about 21.6 million young adults had private health insurance - either through their parents, their jobs or other means - which was 2.5 million higher than before the law was passed.
But the Commonwealth Fund also found 36 percent of young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 - a slightly bigger group - had trouble paying medical bills or said they were paying off medical debt. And among those without insurance, this group rose to 51 percent.
Sara Collins, one of the study's authors and vice president at the Commonwealth Fund, said some young people need maternity coverage, which is often expensive but may not be provided by insurance plans.
Young adults also have the highest rate of injury-related visits to the emergency room - even above children and the elderly - and may have other health conditions such as HIV or the human papillomavirus (HPV).
The survey, conducted online, has an average sampling error margin of 3 percentage points. (Reporting by Anna Yukhananov; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)

Answer: 199 earn a wage or salary of over $50 million a year which turns out to be about $117,000 daily. (Most of the very wealthy get their incomes from investments, not salaries.) 
Why are these fellow Americans interesting? Why is $117,000 a day an interesting number? Because after today those fellow country men and women stop paying Social Security taxes (they continue to pay Medicare tax all year). The Social Security earnings cap is $117,000 per year. 
If you have wages and/or self-employment income that is covered by Social Security you pay Social Security taxes up to a maximum amount that is set by law each year. For 2014, that amount is $117,000 (last year it was $113,700). 
After tomorrow these folks will pay no Social Security taxes, but they will pay Medicare tax all year long because Medicare, since 1993 has had no cap. 
What would happen if everyone eligible paid everything all year long? The Social Security system would be solvent indefinitely and they still would be the richest and prettiest in all the land. Robert Frank was on to them for decades. 
Serious Social Security financing options include raising the cap, which happens to be the most popular option among Americans, most of whom earn less than $50,000,000 per year! 
By the way, who are these top earners? The labor movement and Forbes magazines keeps a public list.

Bestselling author of Survival Investing: How to Prosper Amid ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-ethical-investor-wall_us_5b9c65c1e4b03a1dcc7e5932,Investors have been lulled to sleep by the lullaby song of stockbrokers and bankers who croon that bonds are safe and that equities always outperform bonds in the long run. Wake up before another nightmare market crash shakes you violently from your peaceful slumber.,2012-10-12,BUSINESS,"We saw in the last post in this series that bonds may not be as safe from the very real risk of future inflation as we thought. Now, we would like to suggest that equities or common stocks don't always do better than bonds in the long run. What's a person to do? Bonds risky and unsafe, equities may go down in real value in long run, not up. It is one reason I think people should explore holding more real assets like commodities and real estate in their portfolios rather than all paper financial assets like stocks and bonds.
Wall Street brokers often pitch common stocks by saying that, yes, they can be more volatile in the short run, but over the long run they outperform bonds. The thought is that because equities have a higher expected return associated with them than bonds, they will always do better than bonds over a long horizon. But, equities have this higher expected return because they are riskier than bonds. And you cannot eliminate this higher risk just by holding the equities for a longer time period. In the long run, things trend toward their expected value, but probability and risk prevent them from ever getting there with certainty. The big mistake big sophisticated banks made in this latest financial crisis is that they thought they understood investment risk so well that they could leverage up and guarantee their expected returns with certainty. That is impossible in a volatile world of unexpected events. One thing we can be certain of, the future will always differ from the past and thus be uncertain.
This fallacy that equities outperform bonds in the long run, but are subject to greater volatility in the short run, leads advisers to recommending that young people hold a greater percentage of their wealth in stocks than someone closer to retirement. We have seen that this is bad advice on two fronts. One, seniors are being pushed into holding long bonds that they believe are low risk, but in fact have the potential to be immediately decimated in price and purchasing power if inflation reignites like I think it will. Two, it is used by unscrupulous brokers to convince young people that their money is safe in the stock market. That, over time, their stocks will grow even faster than holding bonds which people presume are fairly safe. 
It always amazes me that risk-averse small investors who wouldn't think of betting $1,000 in Vegas don't mind turning their entire life savings over to a broker they hardly know to invest in the stocks of a bunch of companies they know nothing about. It would be like a stranger coming up to you with a proposition to invest your savings in a hundred old antique desks. Certainly, your lack of knowledge of him, his antique desks or how to value them would prevent you from investing with him, but no such logic prevents investors from investing in the stock market. Heck, most small investors couldn't figure out how to value a company or its stock even if they were somehow magically given the company's exact earnings and dividend stream going forward with certainty.
As with all fallacies, there is a little truth in the belief that stocks always outperform bonds. Academics identified an unusually large equity premium of about 6% per year in the period 1900 to 1985 and called it the ""equity premium puzzle"" because it shouldn't have been as large according to their own finance theories. In other words, it appeared that holding US stocks yielded an additional 6% return per year over holding short risk-free US Treasury securities. Who wouldn't jump at a chance to earn an additional 6% a year over the long haul just because the return in the short run might me a bit more volatile?
Well, like many of these opportunities that academics uncover in the real world, this unusually large equity premium disappeared from 1985 to the present. You can argue that it disappeared because of the market crash, but that is my whole point. The reason that equities appear to outperform bonds in the short run is that we haven't properly accounted for worst case scenarios, or long tails, that seem to happen when we least expect them. I would argue that the large equity premium that was observed for the US stock market in the last century resulted from the fact that the US turned out to be the big global winner, not only in wars, but global economic competition. Can you be certain that the US will be the big winner economically in the 21 century? Low wage countries with huge populations like China and India want their day in the sun and demographics are working against the US as our population continues to age, retire from productive working and need more medical and nursing care. The 20 Century was also a good century for capitalism and capitalists. You would expect stock markets to do well if capitalism did well.
I am not suggesting that a well constructed portfolio not include equities in it. While I wouldn't hold any long bonds right now because of inflation risk, I would hold some percentage of my assets in non-bank and non-high tech equities. You see, I think equities are cheap now because I think in real terms they are not near an all-time high as pundits suggest, but rather near a low.  But, don't kid yourself. They are not guaranteed to go up faster than inflation in the long run and they are not guaranteed to do better than holding other assets. I am advising my investing clients to hold many more real assets like real estate financed partly with long fixed rate mortgage debt as I believe when inflation reignites real assets will outperform most equities and will crush real bond yields which will turn hugely negative. And in a world of expected higher inflation, it is always good to have some strategic long maturity fixed rate debt on your books even if you don't need the money.
Readers to my column have suggested TIPS as a way to go to survive the coming inflationary deluge of new money being printed by the Fed. TIPS are inflation adjusted securities issued by the US Treasury that return a stated real return determined by the market and then automatically adjust each year to compensate the investor for whatever the inflation rate actually was over the period. I recommended TIPS in my 2008 book, Contagion, but have backed off a bit lately as I worry whether or not the government's measurement of CPI will fully capture true inflation in the future. Certainly, to date, CPI has done a poor job recognizing and accounting for inflation in the costs of housing, college tuition and healthcare which happen to be some of the biggest consumption items on an average family's plate. TIPS also deal only with historical inflation so do not move in price quickly enough to reflect greater expected inflation in the future.
Investors have been lulled to sleep by the lullaby song of stockbrokers and bankers who croon that bonds are safe and that equities always outperform bonds in the long run. Wake up before another nightmare market crash shakes you violently from your peaceful slumber.
20 Ways Wall Street is Ripping Off Small Investors
Providing nominal returns, not real returns. Encouraging too much diversification, if that's possible. Hiding fees and expenses. Turning you into a passive investor. Convincing you that money markets are the same as cash. Telling you that bonds are safer than equities. Explaining that in the long run equities outperform bonds. Simply by lying about their products. Convincing you that their bank is a large, stable, safe operation to deal with. Recommending products that have enormous sales commissions attached to them. Cheating you on bid/ask spreads. Selling you what they don't want. Measuring your success in dollars. Lending your securities to others. Ripping your eyes out if you ever try to close your account. Grabbing any slight positive real return for themselves. Sticking toxic waste to small investors. Pretending they can pick stocks. Acting like they are your best friend and they have your best interests at heart. Knowing next to nothing about the value of holding real assets like gold and real estate.

An Illinois appeals court ruled last week that a Chicago investment banker who mooned his superiors got what he deserved: Jason Selch was fired and essentially stripped of a $2 million corporate partnership that would have vested in a few months (h/t Courthouse News). 
At least former Goldman Sachs executive director Greg Smith kept his pants on when he penned his scathing resignation in the New York Times. He called his firm's atmosphere ""as toxic and destructive as I have ever seen it."" 
Selch's antics might cut it in a Hollywood movie about an iconoclastic executive, but in the real gray-flannel world of banking, they overshadowed the ""strong performance""that led to him receiving a partnership percentage, according to court records. Selch had to forfeit the money when he was canned.
Selch contended in his suit that a warning letter he received prevented his firing, and that what he did wasn't severe enough to be shown the door anyway.
""The clear interpretation of plaintiff's behavior is that it was insubordinate, disruptive, unruly and abusive,"" wrote Judge Michael Murphy in the Aug. 29 decision.
In 2005, Selch, an investment bigshot for the recently merged Wanger Asset Management and Bank of America's Columbia Management, was upset to learn that an associate was fired for not accepting a lower salary, according to testimony. So Selch interrupted a meeting between Columbia COO Roger Sayler and his director supervisor, Charles McQuaid. Selch inquired whether he had a non-compete clause with the company. Told no, Selch ""proceeded to unbuckle his pants, pull them down, and 'moon' Sayler and McQuaid,"" according to court documents. The New York-based Sayler testified that Selch told him that he hoped Sayler would never return to the Chicago office. Then Selch exited.
Sayler had the bank's human resources department draft a warning letter, but BofA CEO Keith Banks eventually insisted on Selch's dismissal, reports say. Selch testified that he knew the ""mooning"" could cost him his job, and that he asked about the noncompete clause to determine whether he could find a new job in case he was sacked.
Selch filed suit in 2008, records show. According to Blockshopper.com, he is now an oil and gas company executive who is a private investor and certified financial analyst. He sold a six-bedroom home for $2.2 million in August 2011 after paying $1 million for the property in 1999, the site reported.

It's a lowering of your credit score -- something that impacts your future cost of credit, and even the cost of homeowners and auto insurance.",2013-12-12,BUSINESS,"It's not only Santa who's watching to see who is naughty or nice! In fact, while you're playing Santa, the credit bureaus and credit scoring companies are keeping track of how much you spend as a percentage of y our credit limits. And in January, they'll be watching to see how you repay all the cards you used this holiday season.
The worst penalty isn't a lump of coal in your stocking. It's a lowering of your credit score -- something that impacts your future cost of credit, and even the cost of homeowners and auto insurance. Your credit score ranges from 300 to 850 -- and is probably the most important personal score since you took the SAT exams! A score at the top of the range gives you access to the best deals and lowest rates on major purchases.
Your credit score is derived from all the information on your credit report. By now, you probably know that you're entitled to a free credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus every year. The easiest way to access that totally free report is through AnnualCreditReport.com, which offers direct links to each of the bureaus, without requiring you to sign up for credit monitoring or credit protection programs.  Typically, those credit reports show similar information, because they are simply a compilation of information reported to them by the companies with whom you do business -- credit card issuers, mortgage lenders, medical providers and insurance companies. Information -- good and bad -- stays on your credit report for seven years, until it ""ages"" off, to be replaced by newer (and hopefully better) credit information. (Bankruptcy stays on your credit report for ten years.) You can challenge reported information and correct errors by contacting each bureau.
Your credit score is a sort of ""secret sauce"" formula, or algorithm, created by any of several companies as an easy way to grade your credit performance. Your credit score is a number that reflects a snapshot assessment of how risky it is for a company to extend credit to you.  Some of what goes into your credit score is simply a matter of record: how long you've lived at the same address, had the same job, or held your oldest credit card. There's not much you can do about that. But there are things you can do to impact and improve your credit score, or downgrade it. Simply asking for a new credit card, closing an older card, charging up a greater percentage of your credit limit, or paying only the minimum required monthly payment can all impact your credit score.  Getting Your Score
The oldest and most widely used score is the FICO score -- the original score created by the Fair Isaac Company (thus, FICO) many years ago, when it was rarely disclosed to consumers. Now, you can get your score at www.MyFico.com at no charge. But it comes with a 10 day free subscription to ScoreWatch, which you must remember to cancel immediately or you'll be charged $14.95/month for at least 3 months!
Now, Discover Card is offering a free look at your FICO score, which will be printed on Discover card monthly statements sent to primary Discover cardholders. This may be a temporary promotion, but it is being highly advertised.
At Experian-owned FreeCreditScore.com, you can get your Experian credit score and use the Experian ScorePlanner tool for a payment of just $1. (But if you don't cancel within seven days, you'll be signed up for a membership at $17.99 per month, which includes credit monitoring, fraud alerts, and access to fraud resolution agents.)  When you sign up for the $1 trial, the credit report information that is behind your score is used to ""pre-populate"" the slider calculators on the ScorePlanner tool. The tool is designed to show you how your personal credit behavior impacts the risks which lenders perceive about as they make and price their credit decisions.
You can move the sliders on your computer screen to see how behaviors such as adding a new credit card, increasing the percentage of available credit you are using, inquiring about opening new credit and making late payments have on your credit score.
Obviously, the credit bureaus and scoring companies know that you're interested in ""the number"" that they've been compiling. It's being used as a way to bring in subscribers to their various credit-watch monthly services.  Credit Score and Non-Profit Credit Counseling
There's one more way to get your credit score. The National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC) has joined with Experian, which has donated 80,000 free, 12-month memberships to its above-mentioned website in order to help consumers not only understand, but < improve> their credit scores. It's all part of the NFCC's Sharpen Your Financial Focus program, aimed at empowering consumers to manage credit wisely.
If you go to www.SharpenToday.org, you can start with a visit to the ""MyMoneyCheck-Up"" section of the NFCC website, an online financial self-assessment tool. You can also take advantage of a one-on-one review with an NFCC Certified Financial professional. And then, you can qualify for the free membership that gives you a year of access to not only your credit report and credit score, but to credit monitoring and alerts, and to the Experian ScorePlanner tool, as well.
Now, as you head into the holiday shopping season, is the perfect time to gain control of your credit. Take advantage of the NFCC program. The credit counseling can be done over the phone, and it isn't reserved for people ""in trouble."" NFCC wants to help those just starting out, and those caught in a rut of making minimum monthly payments. Going through their counseling program does not impact your credit, and is not reported to the credit bureaus.  Since all your lenders know the score, don't you think it's smart to get help to change your money behavior and increase your score? So get started today at www.sharpentoday.org -- or by calling NFCC at 855-374-2773. It's free -- and when the bills start arriving in January, you'll be glad you knew the score during the holiday shopping season. That's The Savage Truth.

Helping individual investors build and protect their wealth",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/financial-fraud-seniors_us_5b9b4a36e4b03a1dcc765ffd,"Seniors tend to rely more on the assets they've accumulated, as they may no longer be earning a steady income. Combined with being intellectually vulnerable, this makes them attractive prey for would-be scammers.",2012-03-01,BUSINESS,"Have you ever received an email or phone call promising the investment opportunity of a lifetime, if you'd only be so kind as to share your bank account information and social security number? If so, then you were a potential victim of financial fraud, a crime that comes in many shapes and sizes.
Senior citizens are a growing target for financial scammers. A survey on elder fraud from Investor Protection Trust estimates about 20 pecent of unsuspecting retirees become victims of financial fraud. According to a June 2011 MetLife report, seniors lose more than $2.9 billion a year to financial fraud. That amount is up 12 percent from 2008. But, since many cases of fraud go unreported, these numbers may in fact be far higher.
With the increasing proportion of aging baby boomers -- who account for about a quarter of the U.S. population -- criminals have a wealth of potential victims. According to the same Investor Protection Trust study, one in every five Americans over 65, or about 7.5 million people, has lost money through financial fraud.
Why are retirees so vulnerable? As described in our article ""How Our Aging Brain Affects Our Financial Decisions,"" after age 60, one's cognitive facilities weaken, making the elderly more susceptible to poor decision making. No matter how well-educated we are, financial literacy and savvy decrease as we age, according to Harvard University economics professor David Laibson.
Seniors tend to rely more on the assets they've accumulated, as they may no longer be earning a steady income. Combined with being intellectually vulnerable, this makes them attractive prey for would-be scammers.
And, with more North Americans retiring in debt, they're that much more likely to be tempted by fraudulent ""get rich quick"" schemes. A 2011 AARP Public Policy Institute survey found nearly 15 percent of retired Americans had difficulty paying their credit card bill, rent or mortgage.
Those with money in the stock market may be scrambling that much more. Since the October 2007 market peak, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen approximately 10 percent to date, even taking into account the healthy rally so far this year. As a result, some investors may have lost much of their retirement savings and are looking for quick ways to recoup losses.
All these factors can lead to financial desperation, making retirees particularly easy targets of financial fraud. But, don't let yourself fall victim. You can help prevent financial fraud by following these four steps:
1. Beware of ""Safe"" Returns Higher Than Six Percent.
Unless you're investing in high-yield stocks such as REITs or MLPs, use caution if you come across a financial guarantee which promises a ""secure"" return of 6 percent or more. According to Pat Huddleston, founder and CEO of the private investigative firm Investor's Watchdog, scammers currently lure retirees by offering returns between 6 percent and 8 percent. This yield is not outrageous, but with North American interest rates currently hovering around 1.5 percent, it's wise to probe how a credible financial institution can offer so much more than the average bank. Before you buy, verify the organization's credibility. Often the money you invest is capital you can't afford to lose.
2. Know What You're Investing In.
If you've never heard of a Turkish Eurobond that gives quarterly returns 8.5 percent, or a gas fund that's guaranteed to produce $8,500 in monthly income, it's probably because these securities don't exist. If somebody gives you a sure-fire investment lead, familiarize yourself with it before you commit to a purchase. Practice informed investing as a general principle. Turn to credible websites like our sister site, StreetAuthority, for well-researched investing tips from recognized stock pickers.
3. Avoid the ""Suckers List.""
As a rule of thumb, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is (a scam). With that in mind, don't sign up for sweepstakes, incredible travel giveaways or suspicious free gift offers. According to the National Consumers League fraud center, once the scam bait has been taken, your contact information may end up on a ""suckers list,"" where it's collected and then sold to outside parties. From that time onward, you will likely find yourself receiving a plethora of fake mailings and phone calls.
These are harmless enough, albeit annoying. But, as we age, our ability to discern the credible from the not so credible decreases. Retirees in the early stages of diseases like dementia or Alzheimer's may be that much more prone to fall for illegitimate phone or mail money-grabbing ricks. To find out whether the offer you're receiving is legitimate, you can read about the latest financial schemes at both the Federal Trade Commission and National Consumer's League websites.
4. Beware of the Grandparent Scam.
One frightening scam comes as a call from someone pretending to be a family member needing money. The criminals often do intensive research on the potential victim's family, so their story may sound credible. For example, they might pose as a grandson who was arrested on a trip abroad and needs money wired immediately. If this happens to you, ask the person if you can call them back later and immediately check the facts with your family. Never give money to anyone without verifying their identity.
The Investing Answer: Avoiding financial fraud may seem like common sense, but the elderly must be extra careful about every financial decision. Stay informed and do extensive research before you sign away any of your retirement savings. Of course, there are plenty of other scams out there, including phony charities asking for donations, advance-fee loans, fake checks and identity theft.

So far this year, 39 banks have failed.
While the community bank I’ve used all of my adult life hasn’t failed, it’s in buyout talks and just got federal approval of the deal. As the details get worked out and revealed, I’ll have to decide whether to switch banks – something 1 in 5 banking customers have considered in the past year, a new Consumers Union survey reveals.

Not everyone switches because of mergers or failures, of course. When asked their top reasons why they’d consider switching, the most common responses from the 1,157 people surveyed were…
unexpected fee increases (43 percent) better terms elsewhere (38 percent) poor service (26 percent)

Based on this survey, Consumers Union is demanding Congress and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau make some policy changes. These include forcing banks to allow free, same-day electronic fund transfers and automatically transferring the customer’s automated payments and deposits within two weeks.
Will any of that happen? Rather that holding your breath, here’s how you can switch banks today, with minimal fees and hassle…

567,MONEY,Big Changes Ahead for 2013 Tax Season!,"Mark A. Steber, Contributor

That's the good news. The bad news? Well, this moment of elation may be short-lived.",2012-04-17,BUSINESS,"Do you hear it? That sigh of relief is from millions of taxpayers around the country, relieved that they don't have to file their tax returns for another year. With the tax deadline now here, many Americans are enjoying their tax refunds, putting them to use to pay bills, buy something special or add those dollars to their savings. That's the good news. The bad news? Well, this moment of elation may be short-lived. 
In fact, you can probably spend the remainder of 2012 preparing for some major tax law changes expected to be passed into law later this year. If passed, these changes may be made retroactive to 2012. These changes could also delay the tax filing season, or, if no changes are made, significantly lower many taxpayer's refund amounts in the 2013 tax season. So, there is a lot to watch for over the remainder of the year. 
While new issues will likely arise in the coming months, here is what we know currently -- and what taxpayers should plan for:
The Surge of the Alternative Minimum Tax Every year a number of tax breaks expire, are retroactively reinstated, and, in many cases, few people notice. In fact, several money-saving tax breaks expired on Dec. 31, 2011, and one of those concerned the exemption amounts attached to the dreaded Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), a feature of the tax code that is often a big and unfortunate surprise to many taxpayers.
Four million taxpayers paid AMT in 2011, and more than 31 million are expected to see their tax liabilities rise in 2012 if Congress does not extend the AMT 'patch' and make the extension retroactive to the beginning of the year. The AMT is a complex and separate tax system on top of the regular tax system. In short, this is an additional tax originally created in 1969 to target high income households that typically qualified for numerous tax benefits. These benefits allowed them to owe substantially less money under the tax code at that time. The AMT is calculated by using a separate set of rules that disallow many deductions and exemptions used in computing traditional tax liability, including state income tax or second mortgages, and because the taxable rate is not subject to inflation, over the last several decades more and more middle class taxpayers have been subject to it.
Not only will more people be subject to AMT in the 2012 year, but some common credits, including the Child and Dependent Care Credit and the Saver's Credit, will no longer be allowed against the AMT. 
Additional Benefits Set to Expire In addition to the AMT changes, there are other tax deductions and credits that expired on Dec. 31, 2011 that are no longer available to claim on a 2012 tax return. These include the:
State and Local Sales Tax Deduction -- allowed for taxpayers who have little or no state and local income taxes when itemizing deductions; Educator Expense Deduction -- 250 deduction per educator for eligible K-12 educators for their out-of-pocket, un-reimbursed classroom expenses; Tuition and Fees Deduction -- deduction of up to 4,000 for qualified tuition and related expenses that you pay for yourself, your spouse, or a dependent; Non-Business Residential Property Credit -- the 500 credit for homeowners who make energy-saving and green-energy home improvement; and, Mortgage Insurance Premium Deduction -- the IRS allows you to treat your mortgage insurance as an additional, itemized mortgage interest deduction. 
Government Delays Remember the delay in the 2011 tax filing season due to late tax law passage and implementation? If Congress passes late tax law changes in 2012, or even after the end of the calendar year, the start of the 2013 tax season could be delayed. If Congress does not pass any changes, then taxes may go up for millions of Americans and that would be bad as well. Either way, we have a dynamic year of potential tax law changes to watch for, and you can be certain that tax law change proposals will come forth from various congressional factions. You can also be certain that the 2012 presidential election is likely to bog down any early agreement on tax law changes. Between the tax law changes and the political elections, it's a perfect storm for confusion.
So, what can you do? 
For starters, continue to save and organize your receipts for your contributions, job-related expenses and large ticket expenses, such as home improvements or a new vehicle. You'll need these when filing a 2012 tax return.
Second, do not underestimate the complexity of the tax code. In my opinion, after nearly 30 years in the tax business, complexity is the price we pay for fairness today. If you are not 100 percent confident that you understand how any upcoming changes relate to you, invest in the time to find a knowledgeable, reliable tax resource to navigate you through a successful filing -- one that ideally involves more dollars in your pocket, if you are eligible. Start to build that relationship now, so come January 2013, it will be smooth sailing. 
Finally, stay informed throughout the year. Pay attention to the news and what your elected officials are saying about taxes. This is a BIG year for elections, and taxpayers' collective votes will impact your return. While politics may not be of interest to everyone, your hard earned money is -- and the results of this year's election could impact your wallet next year.

I did stare in silence for a good 5-7 seconds, giving him ample time to retract his statement. He did not. And that is when I lost my mind.",2012-05-07,FAMILY,"Not two days ago, my husband and I were talking about our birth plan. I brought up the fact that I wanted to have a doula. He duly asked, ""What's a doula?"" I explained that she was a cross between a midwife, a coach, a mentor and a super hero for pregnant women. She would be an extra set of hands around during the birth if something, God forbid, goes wrong and she would be there after to help with the transition period of going from no baby to having a screaming, crying, pooping miracle in our lives. I also mentioned that she probably would be an out-of-pocket expense, as insurance doesn't typically cover them. To which my normally super-intelligent husband replied, ""You don't need a doula. You'll be fine. I'll be there. I've helped out when cows were being born on the farm I grew up on in Australia."" (Insert needle on the record scratch here!!!)
For the record, I didn't immediately start yelling at my husband. I did stare in silence for a good 5-7 seconds, giving him ample time to see if he'd realize his faux pas and jump back in the conversation with a, ""I was just kidding, Honey."" He did not. And that is when I lost my mind. I don't remember verbatim what I said, but it was something along the lines of, ""Are you f*@#ing kidding me?! You're comparing the birth of your first child to the birth of a calf on your farm?! Which by default means you're comparing me to a cow?! How dare you call me a heifer you cheap bastard! Don't talk to me! In fact don't even look at me right now. I can't believe you!""
Hindsight is 20/20, and looking back now, I'm certain that I read a little more into his comments than I needed to. But I think we all (at least anyone who has been pregnant) can unanimously agree that that was some dumb s#!t to say to your pregnant, bloated, emotional wife who's excited and somewhat nervous about expecting her first child. Am I right?
I knew I couldn't be alone in this, so I polled some of my friends to see what brilliance came out of their significant others un-filtered mouths. Here are some other dumb things husbands/partners have said to the women carrying their seed:  A girlfriend who is currently six months pregnant with their third child had her husband recently say to her: ""Wow, your arms don't look as big as usual, since you're stomach is sooo big."" He quickly apologized and insisted that she took it the wrong way. Um, how was she supposed to take it?!
Another friend's husband had the audacity to tell her, ""I think you need to be back on your depression medication."" Yeah, that or find a different man to help her raise her baby.
While expecting their first child a friend's husband said, ""Why do you need to read a book about this?"" Now that the baby is 4 months old he's constantly coming to her for answers. She also got more gems from her hubby like, ""Why are you always so tired?"" But the classic came while her head was in the toilet bowl, ""Vomiting again, huh?"" Gee, what do you think, dumbass?
Although she was done with the pregnancy part, a dear friend's now ex-husband takes the cake for most obnoxious behavior. While she was breastfeeding this jackass made moo-ing noises. Really??!!
One of my favorites comes from dear friend comedian Kerri-Louise and mind you her husband is a comic, too. While she was in the hospital in labor and clearly in pain, he said to her, ""Stop moaning, people are going to think we're having sex in here!"" That's a classic. And she surprisingly still speaks to him.
While pregnant with her second child, one of my best friends and fellow comedian Mary Kennedy had her husband say to her, ""You really should take your gay best friend to labor and delivery -- been there done that."" I am pleased to say that he did end up going and they are still VERY married.
But the first place winner of dumb shit said to their pregnant wife goes to the husband of one of my Facebook friends. He said, ‎""I have to go to Philadelphia for this training thing for work right around your due date. Don't worry though, 'cause I'm flying my mom in from Ohio to stay with you that week 'just in case'. But don't worry I'm one plane flight away. Labor lasts for HOURS and sometimes ALL DAY so if you go into labor I'll still get there on time!"" Oh, he's a keeper!!!

571,PARENTING,My Embarrassing Admission as a Doctor: My Son Has a Terrible Diet,"Claire McCarthy, M.D., Contributor
Pediatrician at Boston Children's Hospital, Assistant Professo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/my-embarrassing-admission_us_5b9b7030e4b03a1dcc778afb,I've tried everything I tell parents to do. I started early with healthy foods and have offered them consistently. But nothing has worked. Like I said: embarrassing.,2012-03-14,FAMILY,"As a pediatrician I am embarrassed to admit this, but my 6-year-old son has a terrible diet.
Well, not terribly terrible. He doesn't live on chips and soda. But it's remarkably lacking in the things I always tell my patients to eat, like fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy and whole grains.
It's not for lack of trying on my part. I serve these foods to him regularly, including in the snack I pack him for school. As I encourage parents in my practice to do, I pack things like grapes and string cheese -- which often come back uneaten. I think it was out of sheer exasperation that he wrote this note to us (in his best kindergarten spelling) that I found in his backpack: 

Cheese isn't the only food that gives Liam a ""hedache"". So do apples, carrots, mandarin oranges, and any green grapes that have even a little bit of brown on them. Yogurt is a problem too, as is salad, spinach, tomatoes, brown rice, and finishing his milk. The genius of his approach cracks me up. He's not saying he doesn't like the foods or understand that they are healthy. He'd be happy to eat them if they didn't give him a headache. 
Crackers, pretzels, mashed potatoes, popcorn, pasta, Oreos, Cheezits, French fries, white rice, candy and bagels do not give him a headache. Basically, the diet that suits him best is the White and Sugar diet. Which, interestingly, is the exact same diet that suited his older brother Zack best. (Since my daughters eat pretty well, I can't help wondering if my husband gets the genetic blame.)
I see this all the time in my practice. Well, not the headache part. But when I ask parents if their children are eating fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods, it's really common for me to hear, ""He won't eat them."" It's really true that once kids are no longer babies, once you are no longer literally spooning the stuff into their mouths, it's hard to get them to eat things they don't want to eat.
I've tried everything I tell parents to do. I started early with healthy foods and have offered them consistently. Our house is stocked with healthy snacks (just ask the older kids, who are always complaining, ""there's no sugar in this house!""). We set an example by eating well ourselves -- he's surrounded by examples, including his 11-year-old sister who happily eats the fruit and cheese I pack for her every day. But nothing has worked. As was the case with Zack, he just doesn't like them and will not eat them.
Like I said: embarrassing. 
So, having left ideal in the dust, meals are about compromise. Since peas, corn, and the very top of broccoli crowns do not give him headaches, we try to serve them often. We buy fresh grapes every week so as to increase the chances of finding ones that have no brown spots. We have a Three Bite Rule when it comes to foods he doesn't want to eat (mostly this works out okay, although there have been some OK Corral moments over eating three bites of certain vegetables or casseroles that have made me wonder if it's always a good idea). We negotiate over how much milk he needs to drink (we use numbers of gulps or how low he needs to get on the cup). And we give him a multivitamin every day.
Over time, Zack's diet did improve (a lot, actually). He didn't listen to us, but he did listen to coaches and others who told him that a healthy diet would make him a faster swimmer -- and give him a leaner, meaner physique. He discovered that he liked chicken Caesar salads and that carrots weren't evil. It took until late in high school, but that's okay -- I'm all about better late than never when it comes to healthy habits.
So I'm holding out hope that one day cheese won't give Liam a headache. Until then, I'll keep trying and compromising. Which, sometimes, is the best we can do as parents -- or doctors.

My nanny is like a family member so she sees us at our best, at our worst, and everything in between. What she sees these days is that we are a bit messier, more laid-back and more joyful. Why? Because I am seeking more joy and less stress. I am enjoying my children more and am trying to parent from a happier place.
What I've learned is that I set the tone for my children. If I am stressed and cranky, my kids absorb it and reflect my ugly mood right back to me. When I am peaceful and joyful, they are too... most of the time. And when they aren't, I can roll with it and not get swept up in their moods. When I've taken care of my needs as far as getting enough sleep, having my creative time and taking time for my early morning meditation, my core is centered and unflappable. 
You see, happy mama equals happy kids!
So these days, I focus less on worrying about having a perfect house or super tidy and fashionable kids. My house is clean enough, my kids are decent and everyone is simply happier. I recently quit my job as an environmental engineer after 12 years, and now, as an unemployed writer, I have never felt more peaceful or fulfilled. I am working for myself, and am proud of the example I am setting for my kids. I have taken some big risks and am following my dreams.
This does not mean I achieve perfection every day... far from it. I still oversleep, miss my meditation and snap at my kids when they're taking too long to get their coats on when we are rushing out the door. While not perfect, we are rolling with things. Life is messy, and the more we can just live in the moment and set the best example we can for our kids, the better. Our children watch how we handle tough situations as well as how we savor the lovely ones... absorbing our every move. What kind of example are you setting?
Here's the funny thing. Since I've committed to going with the flow and not being so uptight about keeping my house clean and my kids perfectly put together, we somehow feel more organized and effective overall. We are having more fun and my husband and I are more present with each other and with our kids. I have committed to seek joy and feel good at every opportunity. While this has challenged my midwestern work-hard-all-the-time mentality, it's quickly become a fabulous new way of life. All five of us have become happier.
Happy parents truly do raise happy children. How can you experience more joy today? How can you set a great example of happiness for your children? I'd love to hear from you, so please leave a comment below!

Editor-in-chief of Brain Child",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/even-tween-boys-need-hugs_us_5b9dbe64e4b03a1dcc8c5acf,"Just like anyone, I know my son needs physical affection. The trouble is, he's a 10-year-old boy and doesn't know where to get it.",2014-01-13,FAMILY,"Written by Jack Cheng for Brain, Child Magazine
My 10-year-old son can be a train wreck.
I know it's not his fault. His limbs are growing faster than he knows, and his brain is all over the place, from the world of Minecraft to the Marvel Comics Superhero Universe to the Greek gods of the Percy Jackson-verse. Still, excuses aside, he's simply not that cognizant of his own body.
When he walks down the hall, I cringe, worried that he'll knock over framed photos hanging on the walls.
When he wobbled his bike down a path through the park, I winced as he passed pedestrians, afraid that he would ride into them.
And he hardly ever seems to walk by his little sister without bumping into her, sometimes jostling her playfully, sometimes just knocking her over.
""What's wrong with him?"" my wife and I would ask each other, after sending him to his room for a body checking infraction.
It took a while, but I think I figured out what was wrong, why he had an incessant need to bump into things, consciously or not. My wife always suggests exercise: ""A tired kid is a good kid"" is one of her mottos (which, I'll note, she adapted from something she heard in a dog obedience course). Another dad at soccer practice was telling me his son needed tackle football -- that boys this age just needed to run into each other and get some of that energy out. I think my wife and this dad were on to something, but I think there's something beyond just physical activity.
I thought back to wrestling with my son as a toddler. It seemed both recent and long ago that I would lift him above my bed, throw him onto the mattress and shout ""Body slam!"" while smothering his body with my own. It's been a few years since we'd played like that. And that's when I realized:
He needed a hug.
Part of the reason it took me so long to understand is my experience of my own family. I never doubted that my parents or my sisters loved me, but I also remember how bizarre it seemed the first time I saw my parents holding hands. This is a clear memory since I was probably about 16 at the time. They are fairly traditional Chinese people who are not into public displays of affection.
I wasn't sure my son would admit he wanted to be hugged, but I tested my theory. The next time he bumped his sister, I got reflexively mad again, but I kept my temper in check and took a deep breath. ""Come over here,"" I commanded, and then, to his surprise, I gave him a big squeeze. He returned the gesture and, after a minute, it seemed to make him feel better. He may have just been relieved that he wasn't getting punished.
Just like anyone, I know my son needs physical affection. The trouble is, he's a 10-year-old boy and doesn't know where to get it. His sister hugs all her friends, even hugs her teachers goodbye, but he and his buddies don't embrace. They race side by side, they climb trees, they sit next to each other playing video games but they get embarrassed when they touch. Once after a brief falling out with a friend, I told my son and his pal to shake hands and I could sense that the physical act was as awkward as the apology.
He's getting big, and heavy, and frankly, has a bony butt, so sitting on his parents' laps has long been a rare occasion. He doesn't hug his sister, but left to their own devices, their games often involve piggyback rides or feats of dual gymnastics that require grappling of some sort.
So now I hug him. I told my wife, when he's acting up, I'm going give him a hug -- the fact that he's misbehaving is my signal that he needs it.
Then, at dinner last week, I asked, a bit teasingly, ""Hey, how come I hug you, but you never hug me?""
He asked me a question in response, ""How come we only hug when you're mad at me?""
I was taken aback. I had figured out a transaction -- he acts up, give him a hug -- but I'm still not a particularly huggy person myself. My social engineering was totally transparent to him. In fact, it was backfiring -- he took a hug to mean that I was mad at him. The worst part was, he was right. My heart was in my throat.
""I'm not mad at you now,"" I said.
He came over and we held each other tight. When I let go of him, he wiped his eyes, but he assured me that that was just his allergies.
I suffer from the same allergens.

Most of us would rather drop from exhaustion than face the guilt of caring for our own needs. However, when Mom is depleted, the whole household suffers.",2012-08-22,FAMILY,"We all know that a good mother should be loving, nurturing, giving, and kind to her children. But can a good mother offer those same traits to herself? As a mother and stepmother of five children, I've learned the importance of self-care. I also know how difficult it is to make it happen. 
First is the issue of guilt. I've noticed that women have an easier time sacrificing themselves than taking care of themselves. Most of us would rather drop from exhaustion than face the guilt of caring for our own needs. However, when Mom is depleted, the whole household suffers. 
Second, even when we understand the importance of self-care, the issue is logistics. How do we fit self-care into an already-overflowing schedule? Who has the time, energy, or money for spa days, date nights, gym memberships or new hobbies? 
Fortunately, mothers can find solutions without engaging in time-consuming activities or drastically changing their circumstances. Self-compassion and the resulting feeling of calm is an inner process. The following well-being practices, inspired by Shortcuts to Inner Peace, are so simple to do and so easy to implement that they fit into any lifestyle. These tools offer effective and guilt-free TLC for busy moms. 
Good Morning Sunshine
When:  When you wake up and before you get out of bed in the morning.
What:  Lie on your back and place one hand on your heart. Place the other hand on your belly. Rest like this for a minute and imagine light within you, the light of love. Breathe in the words ""I am loved"" and breathe out the words ""I love."" Think of your partner, your children, or someone else whom you love (a person or a pet) and let that love fill you, expanding within you and radiating in the form of light.
Why: Most women -- most people, in fact -- struggle with the simple goal of loving themselves. If you take just a moment to fill yourself with love first thing in the morning, you lower your stress level and begin to tap into the refueling property of self compassion.
---
Take 5
When:  When you are in the bathroom.
What: Breathe in through your nose to the count of five. Hold the breath to the count of five. Exhale long and deep through your lips to the count of five. Let your shoulders drop as your body relaxes.
Why:  A regular breathing practice helps calm the body and still the mind. As you center yourself with this simple breathing technique, you will be more energized and less stressed. Make it a habit and notice a feeling of calm begin to weave through your days.
---
Text Treat
When: After you finish lunch.
What: Text a friend, family member, or your beloved partner.
Why: Mothers need to remember that they have important relationships with people other than their children. Taking a moment to connect, even briefly, with someone special helps you recall that you're more than a mom and readies you for confident and loving mothering.
---
Take Me Away
When: In the late afternoon, when you have tea/coffee/protein drink.
What: Close your eyes for a moment and picture yourself in a safe, beloved, wonderful place. A place of peace. Breathe in the scene and exhale slowly. You may picture a scene from your childhood, a great vacation, a special haven, or even an imaginary tropical beach. Imagine the sensory details of sound, sight, smell, taste, and touch.
Why:  Even a brief imaginary visualization acts like a mini-vacation. Treat yourself daily to a place that makes you smile. Your body and mind will relax in response.
---
Puppy Love
When: When you reunite with your romantic partner at the end of the day.
What:  Approach each other and hug for 10 to 20 seconds (the time it takes to activate the bonding hormone, oxytocin).
Why:  Small daily acts of connection help to keep your relationship strong. Furthermore, modeling intentional intimacy for your children will help them understand the importance of maintaining healthy relationship habits. You'll be surprised at the dramatic effect this simple hugging habit can have on your romantic relationship.  ---
Rest in Peace
When: When your head rests on the pillow at night.
What: Think of three specific things from your day for which you are grateful (gratitude for a hug from a child, for fresh strawberries, for a lovely sunset). Notice small details and let the feeling of appreciation really sink into your body and mind.
Why: Gratitude is a practice that increases your sense of well-being. It not only increases your satisfaction with your life but, when you make it a habit, it can actually change your brain in a way that expands your capacity for feeling fulfilled. 
Using these six essential daily habits is a foundation for healthy living. You'll begin to feel more at peace and more connected in a way that renews your enthusiasm for mothering. Show your children that taking care of yourself and your adult relationships is what all good mothers do.

While the rest of the world is out to dinner, parents -- especially those who don't want to spend inordinate amounts on a sitter and prix fixe menu -- are more likely at home doing dinner, bath, bedtime, collapse-on-the-floor. But, just because you have little kids, doesn't mean you have to give up a romantic holiday. 
""[Having a good night] takes goodwill and the intention to have a positive experience,"" says psychologist Harriet Lerner, author of “Marriage Rules: A Manual for the Married and the Coupled Up.” ""People get so child-focused that it becomes difficult for them to really talk to each other in advance about what's going to be the most fun, romantic way to spend the evening.""

But in America, our total focus at this stage and age is on rights. In fact, the first thing that pops into our minds when we think about turning ""21"" is drinking.",2013-08-05,FAMILY,"My son just turned 21. My wife, Pam, and some of his friends took him out for a nice dinner. We celebrated with him his cultural rite of passage. We joked about his legal right to drink... and about how most teens can hardly wait for that birthday.
His birthday, in fact, triggered a thought in me.
In every culture, the people who live there create rites of passage. They are markers that distinguish childhood from adulthood. In many cultures, there are ceremonies for young boys to learn how to be a man. For instance, in many African cultures, boys leave their mothers and go into the village for several days, learning to thatch a roof, hunt an animal, interact with men and use tools and weapons. Even today, the Hebrew culture celebrates the Bar Mitzvah and Bat Mitzvah for boys and girls who become teens. Regardless of how sacred the ceremony is, it is a rite of passage for those young people. It's about growing up.
But in America, our total focus at this stage and age is on rights. In fact, the first thing that pops into our minds when we think about turning ""21"" is drinking. It's the rite of passage. Manhood is about what you have the license to do. You can drink now. You can smoke. Sex is legal without talking to parents, or checking into a hotel or renting a car. All kinds of privileges become their possession. 
What's Missing?
When I paused to think about it, it dawned on me... there's nothing about personal responsibility, as in past cultures. It's about alcohol or sex, but never coupled with the counterpart of the responsibilities that arrive with our coming of age. While I believe alcohol and sex are to be enjoyed in the proper context, you rarely hear positive stories about young people -- who've just turned 21 -- that involve sex and alcohol. Why? Because rights without responsibility are rarely redemptive. In fact, much of the time, rights minus responsibilities simply create selfish brats. Privileges without price tags don't really help us grow up.
While I love the 21-year-olds I know... I dislike our emphasis on turning 21.
What If...
What if we pondered this issue, and came up with an incredible responsibility that became part of the 21st birthday in America? It would have to be a responsibility that challenged the guy or girl at the heart level; it must engage their passions. It must harness their creativity and gifts. It must be something they've wanted for a while, but only becomes theirs as they come of age. I know some parents who:
• Planned international trips for their kids when they turned a certain age. These were service trips, where they helped people in developing nations.
• Talked about projects in the community to help neighbors, but they reserved them for their kids to engage in when they came of age.
• Purchased power tools for their sons, but only allowed them to use them on a project they wanted to build when they came of age.
You'll have to figure out what works with your young people, but if we want our kids to become healthy adults -- responsibilities and rights must always go together.

Mom, writer, doer of laundry",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/my-lovers_us_5b9dc05de4b03a1dcc8c6f2c,"Where do you find these ""lovers""? Do you rent them? Buy them? Do they come in different sizes and require batteries?",2014-01-02,FAMILY,"I was at a function the other day. Are you imagining a soiree with frou-frou cocktails and men in tuxedos waltzing with women in sequin-covered dresses and heels? Sorry to disappoint. The function was a yearly sale next to the hot dog stand at Costco. The crowd was energetic, diverse and quite unassuming. As I was waiting to enter this ""sale of sales,"" I found myself becoming entrenched in a conversation that a group of women were having. That's a gentle way of saying I was eavesdropping.
The women ranged in age from their late twenties through 45ish. They were discussing their relationships and the ups and downs that inevitably go with them. One woman was certain her husband was surprising her with a summer cruise while another was ready to move out and leave the kids with ""him."" And then, the 45-ish woman began to speak of her.... (drumroll) lover.
I choked on my hot dog at the sound of that word. A lover? The woman had a lover? Maybe it's me, but that's a term I've only heard in songs from Air Supply circa 1984.
I was in full Yenta mode. She was my age (truth be told, I am not 25) and she had a lover. Wow. I began repeating that word in my head between hot dog bites.
My lover. Hmmm. Where do you find these ""lovers""? Do you rent them? Buy them? Do they come in different sizes and require batteries?
I have never used the term before. I have said ""I love you,"" to my parents, kids, husband and pets, but never used ""lover"" to describe a person's relationship with me. Is a boyfriend a lover? How about a bed buddy? Does that count? Is your husband your lover?
I thought about this for a moment and before I knew it, I was starring in my own James Bond flick.
I pretended my ""lover"" was sending me text messages as I looked at my phone and giggled. The women glanced my way as I smiled at the pretend sweet nothings my ""lover"" was texting to my Goofy-covered iPhone. I seductively reapplied my cherry-flavored chapstick. (After picking a piece of potato chip off -- daughter must've used it). I let out a raucous laugh as my lovers texts became suggestive and R-rated.
I wondered what my lover's name should be; something exotic like Vincenzo or Jacques. Maybe I had many lovers; one per country or time zone depending on my mood. Jon Paul would whisk me off to Paris for the weekend where we would frolic in the countryside amongst the daffodils and enjoy a picnic of pink champagne and escargot. 
A week later, Antonio would have his driver fetch me for a quick getaway to Rome, where we would dine along the Venice canals sipping sweet sangria and feeding each other tiny bites of pistachio gelato topped off with an evening of unbridled passion.
I guess if I were in a country-western mood, my Levi-wearing, flannel shirt lover would take me to his dude ranch for a weekend of horseback riding (be creative) and ribs. This led me to wonder if all lovers were wealthy and lived in fancy estates adorned with imported marble and butlers. Maybe they were struggling musicians with tattooed arms and piercings. Perhaps my struggling, misunderstood musician declared his love for me in a song or by getting his nipple pierced. The possibilities were endless, as was the vibrating I kept feeling in hand. (It was the phone -- keep it G-rated, please). I was soon transported from a steamy hotel room with Roger Moore to singing snowmen who wanted to live in the springtime.
When I stopped my reverie to actually answer the phone, it was my 6-year old daughter wondering why it was taking me so long to come home. I heard my husband and the other kids in the background all waiting for mom to get home so they could eat dinner. (Why is that always the case? I have an endless supply of Vanilla Chex).
And that's when I realized: I do have lovers, many of them. They have different names, styles, likes and dislikes. They come in different shapes, sizes and enjoy a variety of hobbies. One of them even gets to take me out on special dates which (if he's lucky) leads to an even more special night. Right at that moment, I got that mushy feeling us moms get when we imagine our home life peaceful and serene like a Norman Rockwell painting.
As my group was about to enter the sale of sales, I quickly did an about-face. One of the women asked where I was going, ""This is a once in a lifetime sale!"" 
I casually replied, "" I have to go, my lovers need me.""

If the price seems too steep for a trashcan",2013-12-10,FAMILY,"Everybody's favorite annual consumerist bonanza has already taken the nation by storm, so if you're a parent of a teenager (and haven't gotten your shopping done yet), cue your annual gift-giving panic about what to get that hard-to-please person. Whether they're deep in the sullen depths of adolescence, or totally past their ""awkward phase,"" teens are a notoriously difficult demographic to shop for. Allow us to make it easy: Here are 12 gifts we promise your teen doesn't want -- and 12 sweet alternatives we think they'll like a lot more.
1. Don't Get: A Facebook points gift card

Your teen may have gone gaga for Farmville circa '08, but Facebook is basically the retirement community of the social media world. Not even Mark Zuckerburg pretends that Facebook is still cool. 
Instead Get: A next-level iPhone camera lens

This awesome iPhone-attachable clip-on camera lens will seriously up your teen's Instagram game. Or just help them take better pictures.
2. Don't Get: A goldfish

It's just going to die...
Instead Get: A flying shark 

This inflatable remote-control aircraft will never die of old age, though sharp objects could bring it to an untimely end. Either way, it will be much less tragic than flushing Nemo down the toilet.
3. Don't Get: Boring-ass socks

Snooze. Sure they're practical, but since when does Christmas have anything to do with practicality? 
Instead Get: The nuttiest socks you can find

If you insist on gifting your favorite teen the world's dullest of undergarments, they've got to be some seriously rad socks. Shop Jeen has a few that make us feel strong feelings about things.
4. Don't Get: A gingerbread house kit

Hypothetically, building a gingerbread house doesn't sound like a lofty architectural feat. Still, your teen's probably too lazy to assemble the entire graham cracker abode, meaning you'll be left with disappointment, crumbs and seriously overpriced frosting tubes.
Instead Get: A popcorn maker.

All the deliciousness, none of the manual labor. Plus, you've kind of always wanted one.
5. Don't Get: A temporary tattoo kit

Sure, you're terrified that your teen is going to get inked up once the clock strikes their 18th birthday. Still, a temporary tat is a Chuck 'E Cheese prize -- not a persuasive alternative to your teen's dream dragon tramp stamp.
Instead Get:  Temporary hair dye

Here's a cool way to let teens express themselves without looking like a walking gummy bear factory explosion come graduation. These Hair Flairs temporary hair dyes are easy to apply, and won't stain clothes. Teenage rebellion's never been more harmless.
6. Don't Get: Another goofy Star Wars shirt

This shirt would have been cool in like, a galaxy far, far away.
Instead Get: An R2D2 novelty toy

Snag an R2D2 garbage can, and your kid will always come home for the holidays. If the price seems too steep for a trashcan (it kind of is) or if expecting your teen to throw trash anywhere other than the floor seems laughable, this R2D2 car charger or talking R2D2 bank are less pricey alternatives.
7. Don't Get: A DVD box set

DVD box sets: Not current enough to be cool, not obsolete enough to have nostalgia value.
Instead Get: A Netflix subscription. 

They'll cry happy tears, and then disappear for a week to binge-watch ""Breaking Bad.""
8. Don't Get: Extremely reasonable winter trappings

They'll never remember to put them on in the morning.
Instead Get: Earmuff/headphone hybrid

They'll never forget to grab their headphone earmuffs (or dare we say it -- hearmuffs?), which simultaneously blast their favorite tunes and keep their ears from freezing off.
9. Don't Get: A bank bond

This is just a big tease. Does money that can't be spent even really exist? 
Instead Get: A cool experience 

Make Christmas a little less consumer-minded and gift your teen a memorable adventure. The company Xperience Days has an enormous collection of classes, lessons and adventures in major cities across the country. Offers run the gamut from paddling excursions to piloting lessons.
10. Don't Get: A Water Pik

Gifting this tooth cleaner will get you one seriously closed-mouth smile.
Instead Get: Radically yummy dental care
 Bacon toothpaste, for example:

Or perhaps cupcake toothpaste  for your favorite sweet-toothed adolescent:

Moral of the story: When giving the gift of good hygiene, make sure it comes in tasty flavors.
11. Don't Get: A monogrammed door sign

Unless Owen still enjoys finger painting, he probably won't be too fond of this sign.
Instead Get: A Grown-Up Version

It's basically the glamorous older cousin of your classic childhood monogram sign. It's pricey though -- For an equally out-of-this-world monogram gift that won't break the bank, we recommend these:

12. Don't Get: Tupperware

It'll store their food and keep it fresh, but they'll still cry on Christmas.
Instead Get: An iPhone wristlet

The best storage device you could possibly get a millennial. Never again will your teen sacrifice an iPhone to the toilet bowl.
There are a lot of god-awful presents out there, but an equal number of spectacularly rad gifts for your teen. Heed our advice, and your teen will be positively jolly come Christmas morning.

580,PARENTING,Why I'm OK With Having Only One Child,"Andrea Meyer, Contributor
Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-im-ok-with-having-only-one-child_us_5b9daf98e4b03a1dcc8b75f0,"I do still wish, more than anything, that I had two children: Aidan and Nina. But now I know that longing for the daughter I lost does not mean I want a replacement.",2013-12-19,FAMILY,"There are things a woman pregnant with her second child is simply not supposed to say: No, I'm not excited. No, I don't want to be pregnant. No, I don't want this baby.
Don't get me wrong. I love being a mother. I'm so crazy about my son, Aidan, that even my mom friends tease me about my unrestrained gushing. But I wasn't prepared to be pregnant for the second time. In the picture my husband took of me right after I'd taken the test, I sit hunched on the couch, my right hand covering my face as if I'm hiding from the paparazzi, the blue-and-white plastic stick in my left. So when this baby's heart inexplicably stopped beating in the ninth month of pregnancy, it felt like payback. I was convinced on some level that she'd died because I hadn't wanted her enough.
I conceived Aidan through IVF and had him one month shy of my 40th birthday. High on new motherhood, I assumed we'd have two children mainly because everyone has two children. Truth be told, my husband, Harlan, and I weren't totally on board for more than one. While I was astounded by the intensity of my love for my son, motherhood also had left me drained, short-tempered, and frustrated by my inability to reboot my writing career. I missed my work and my upbeat former self, and I shuddered to imagine how long it would take to get them back with two kids. It didn't help that when Aidan was 18 months old, Harlan got a job in Boston and we left the life I loved in Los Angeles for a cold New England town where we knew no one. I found myself alone all day with a toddler, waiting for my husband to get home, like a dog wagging her tail by the front door. 
I definitely didn't want another child badly enough to endure the physical and emotional rigors of IVF again, so instead we had unprotected sex and thought maybe we'd get lucky. Given my age and history with infertility, we knew it was unlikely, which probably explains our cavalier baby-making strategy. I didn't realize just how thoroughly ambivalent I was until I conceived our daughter right after the move to Boston. I cried after our first ultrasound, but not for joy. I had loved my son from the instant I saw him but didn't know if I could feel that way about another child. I didn't want to feel that way about another child -- it felt like cheating.
I spent my second pregnancy glowering and resentful, cursing the stretch marks spiderwebbing up my abdomen, and snapping at my husband. There were happier moments, of course, like when we learned we were having a girl: I was overjoyed that Aidan would remain my only little boy. But such joy was short-lived, and Harlan, an only child who was initially excited about giving Aidan the sibling he never had, began to wonder whether I could handle the strain of taking care of both a toddler and an infant, not to mention whether our marriage would survive the stress. It was hard for him to stay enthusiastic when I was so miserable, and both of us nervously awaited the birth of our daughter.
Then one night five weeks before I was due to give birth, I was lying in bed and realized I hadn't felt the baby move all day. Panicked, I rolled onto my abdomen, trying to stimulate movement, and pleaded, ""Please move, baby. Baby, please move.""
I called Harlan, who was working out of town, and he assured me that everything would be OK. The next day, I went to the hospital, where the midwife on call moved an ultrasound wand over my massive abdomen.
""I'm not finding a heartbeat,"" she told me.
""What?""
""There's no heartbeat,"" she said. ""I'm sorry, honey.""
""What?""
""Sorry, honey.""
I looked at the screen, at my daughter's body, the ribs and spinal column perfectly formed. I didn't see the flicker of movement I'd come to recognize as my baby's heartbeat either. But I didn't believe this woman, even as I frantically called Harlan to give him the news. He said he was coming home immediately and started to cry. Harlan understood what I didn't, what I couldn't. I couldn't comprehend or cry until later, but long before I acknowledged my baby's death or felt any sadness, the words ""I want another baby"" sprang into my head -- unambiguous, clear as water, unsullied by doubt.
After eight hours of drug-induced labor, I gave birth to a beautiful, lifeless four pound baby girl we named Nina. After holding her, singing to her, and finally crying endless, helpless tears, I went home with Harlan, the delivery nurse's command -- ""Come back and have another baby with us"" -- ringing in my ears.
As we lay stunned on our bed looking blankly at the ceiling, Harlan turned to me and said, ""We can adopt.""
""Or I could get pregnant again.""
""That terrifies me,"" he said. A silence ballooned around his words before he added, ""Or we could just raise one really great kid.""
My cheeks flushed with anger: I was supposed to be nursing a baby, not debating whether or not to have one.
In the weeks that followed, I was felled by rage and grief, getting out of bed only because I needed to care for my son. Doctors could not tell us why Nina died. These things just happen sometimes, they said. At night, like an amputee who still feels her missing limb, I would ache for the daughter I'd lost, convinced that her absence was a hole that had to be filled, that my pain would abate only if I carried another child to term. Harlan, on the other hand, was determined to make a conscious decision about having another child. Rather than simply assume that two kids were better than one, he wanted to really consider what would be best for our family. Gently he'd remind me of my negativity during my second pregnancy and suggest that maybe we shouldn't try again. 
I understood his concerns, as well as the inherent risks of pregnancy at my age, but I could no longer consider having an only child. For one thing, I couldn't stop thinking about something happening to Aidan. The worst thing possible had happened to Nina, after all, and if I lost my son, I would need another child to give me a reason to keep breathing. Plus, my guilt over Nina's death continued to torment me, even when my mother assured me that it was not my fault. ""Everyone is ambivalent about having children,"" she told me. ""You were just more honest about it.""
To make matters worse, in Cambridge, where we live, most families have at least two kids, and three is rapidly becoming the new two. Many of my mom friends in their 40s were doing repeated rounds of IVF, many after a miscarriage, so desperate were they for a second. Their bellies, swollen with siblings to come -- and after they were born, the babies themselves (whom I usually couldn't even bring myself to meet) -- made me feel inadequate, as if I were less a mother than they were. When the first of five (five!) pregnant mothers in Aidan's preschool class gave birth to a little girl, I almost said to her son, a 2-year-old in an ""I am a big brother"" shirt, ""Aidan had a baby sister too, but she died and he never got to meet her."" I had to bite my tongue.
Beyond my own guilt and desire to do what was right for my son, I had to deal with everyone else's expectations. A dermatologist I saw about removing a cyst on my face that had grown while I was pregnant advised me to postpone surgery in case I decided to have another child. ""Go have that baby!"" she enthused. I began to protest that I was 43, when she interrupted, ""Go have that baby now! A sibling is the greatest gift you can give your child."" How could I possibly stop at one?
A good friend, the mother of two boys, told me, ""Aidan doesn't need a sibling, but he does need happy parents."" She was right, of course, but no matter how much Harlan and I thought about it, discussed it -- with each other, with a therapist, with our infant-loss support group -- it was hard to know which path would make us happier. Even after I'd done Reiki in an attempt to find clarity and consulted an ""insight therapist"" who assured me that having another child was my heart's desire, I couldn't bring myself to nudge Harlan to toss the condoms and make a baby with me. Clearly this was not an intellectual decision we could make by analyzing the pros and cons. 
If people decided with their heads to have children, no one would do it. Instead, with hope in our hearts, we leap. I asked myself: Shouldn't I make the small sacrifice of a few scary months and hectic years so that Aidan could have a brother or sister? So that I could feel the joy of a baby's first cry again? Wouldn't that be the right thing to do? Instead, I just sat there, listening to the ever-fainter ticking of my biological clock and waiting for a sign.
Then, one afternoon a few weeks after the emotional second anniversary of Nina's death, Harlan and I had unprotected sex at a friend's apartment in New York. We were house-sitting for the week; Aidan was napping in the other room; Harlan had a raging fever, and I was dressed up and ready to go to a bridal shower for a friend who, of all things, had accidentally become pregnant for the first time at 44 -- with twin girls. Suddenly my husband and I were clinging to each other on the couch, for once with no time for thought or discussion. When it was over, Harlan, wild-eyed, like someone possessed by an unseen spirit, held up his hands and said, ""Be prepared!""
I immediately started displaying pregnancy symptoms: I was bloated and abnormally teary during movies, and I developed a bionic sense of smell, the odor of cat food assaulting me every time I walked through the front door. When my period was three, four, then five days late, the one friend I'd confided in urged me to take a pregnancy test. With Harlan on the phone (he was again out of town for work), I held the plastic stick with shaking hands.
The test was negative. And I was relieved. No, elated. Harlan's laughter and nervous chatter -- ""Oh my God, babe, wow"" -- told me he felt the same. I bounced around the house. I ate chocolate pudding. I looked through my wedding album for the first time in years, swooning and giggling at every shot. I was surprised by my response, and I knew what it meant: I did not want to have another baby. I probably hadn't wanted one all along. I had been temporarily swayed -- by the myth of the spoiled, lonely only child, by fear of losing Aidan, by grief and guilt over Nina's death -- but the truth is that Harlan, Aidan, and I are just fine the way we are.
Sometimes as the three of us walk down the street, Aidan between us, Harlan and I hold his hands and swing him into the air. Each time, he laughs and shrieks, ""Again!"" And each time I am struck by the perfect symmetry of our small family. Not that I'm free and clear from doubt -- I don't always believe the books that swear that only children are just fine. The big broods I see every day on the playground -- the siblings fighting, hugging, chasing each other -- can trigger acute bouts of envy and self-doubt, and I'm stricken with sorrow by cute toddlers who remind me of what I'll never have again. When people ask if I'm going to have more kids, I don't proudly announce that I'm done. Instead, I blurt out that I lost a child, as if to rationalize my decision and assure them that I'm not one of those selfish moms who puts her own needs first.
But I am one of those moms. I put my fear -- of another pregnancy, of something being wrong with my child, of all the ways having another child might strain the fabric of our family -- squarely before the benefits of giving Aidan a brother or sister. I need to respect this fear, like the fear of sharks or household fires, in order to protect my family of three, to preserve the delicate happiness we have finally created.
Of course, safety often comes at a cost. I do still wish, more than anything, that I had two children: Aidan and Nina. But now I know that longing for the daughter I lost does not mean I want a replacement. And when I find myself doubting my choice, I wrap my arms around my son and remind myself how lucky I am to have this one great kid.

While I admired the fleeting beauty in my neighborhood, my son was contemplating the flip side of an age-old childhood quandary: ""How will Santa know not to come here?""",2012-12-12,FAMILY,"It was no treat living outside of Cleveland for a year when my kids were little. It snowed on November 1st and the sun went on sabbatical until May. I'd grown up in Philadelphia, had lived in Hershey, Pennsylvania and had spent a few years in Chicago, so it wasn't really the cold that battered me so much as the gray. But the holiday season, coupled with the wonder of childhood, had a way of brightening even the darkest of cityscapes.
It was easy to forget that chill as I cozied up with my 4-year-old son on the sofa that backed up against our a floor-to-ceiling window. The hill on which we lived gave us a view of two streets lined with houses. On this night, most homes were flickering with Christmas lights. They flickered and limmered and we had a front row seat. The snow reflected not only the moonlight, but those strings of icicle lights and flashing North Pole signs. While I admired the fleeting beauty in my neighborhood, my son was contemplating the flip side of an age-old childhood quandary. 
""How will Santa know not to come here?"" He was as serious as a 4-year-old can be.
We didn't have a chimney, but that didn't matter. The even more relevant fact that we are Jewish and so do not celebrate Christmas in any way, shape or form -- even as a secular holiday -- was not sufficient enough to quell the fears of my pensive preschooler.
As a mom, I was at a fork in the road of parenting. I could have very well told him that parents leave all the presents, and that Santa isn't real, just a nice guy in a costume. I could have explained that parents do that for their children because it's fun and part of the Christmas tradition in our country. But, those words stuck in my throat. That wasn't what he was asking. He believed. He was 4. And even though it wasn't my myth to perpetuate, I did not want him to lose his sense of awe and wonder. Even of Santa. 
He was not hoping for a few misbegotten toys to show up on Christmas morning, although I'm sure he found himself somewhat distracted at the idea of yet another Power Ranger. He wasn't secretly wishing for a tree, nor did he want to leave cookies and milk ""just in case."" He'd been showered with gifts for eight nights of Hanukkah and he attended a Jewish preschool. I knew he wasn't feeling deprived or left out of anything. At that point in his life, he didn't know anyone who celebrated Christmas. To him, the thought of a big man in a red suit coming into his house was troubling, even scary. He wanted my reassurance there was no way that guy and his sleigh were going to land on our roof and traipse through our little bungalow. And while it was my job to quell his fears, I did not want to burst a childhood bubble of belief. 
""See those lights?"" I pointed out the window. He nodded. ""Santa only goes to the houses with the lights.""
""Oh,"" he said.
A good save.
When my son lost his first tooth later that year, the same thing happened with the Tooth Fairy. My kid was mortified. He wanted no part of some stranger coming into his room in the middle of the night, flying no less, and sticking her hand under his pillow! Money or not, this was just not an idea he was buying into. So, we put his pillow on the kitchen table with the tooth under it. And, I'll be darned, that Tooth Fairy is one smart magical creature. She knew just where to go. 
Tooth fairies, we learned, are very accommodating. 
I think about these events every time the Santas reemerge in the malls and on the street corners. I smile. I wonder what I'd have done if we did indeed celebrate Christmas. Would I have dressed my son in his plaid finery and plunked him on St. Nick's lap at the local mall, screaming in terror? You know, the way he did when he I took him for a hair cut? I'll never know.
What I do know is that I smile when I see the adorably dressed, color coordinated tikes lined up, sucking on their candy canes ready to meet the big guy in the red suit. And I love teasing my son about sitting on Santa's lap now. I promise Santa would be the one shaking in his boots as my almost 21-year-old asked for what he really wants. (That's something I really do not want to ponder.) 
My son, who stands 5'9"" to my 5'3"", still smiles like a little boy when I tell him these tales of his long-ago worries and questions. His stature has changed, yet not so much his sweetness. I've never been sorry that I rewrote the script for some childhood characters to meet the needs of our family at that moment. 
If there's one thing I'm sure of it's this: things change. And that's one reason I'm confident in saying that anyone who wants to leave money under my son's pillow, or come down the chimney and leave presents, is more than welcome to do so.

582,PARENTING,A Stay-at-Home Dad's Thoughts on Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In,"Vincent O'Keefe, Contributor
Ph.D Amer. Lit., At-Home Dad",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stay-at-home-dads-thoughts-on-lean-in_us_5b9cfaa6e4b03a1dcc8378b4,"As a stay-at-home father, I have ""leaned way in"" to my family, and it was the right arrangement for us. But I always try to remind myself of the luxury of my choice and remain grateful for my different kind of success.",2013-04-01,FAMILY,"Like Sheryl Sandberg, I was voted ""Most Likely to Succeed"" back in high school. Many years later, she became the COO of Facebook and I became a stay-at-home father (and part-time writer). Stuff happens. But, since I now have two tween daughters, I read her Lean In with them in mind. For the most part, I remained part of the inspired choir she's preaching to about the need for a culture more conducive to women's ambition for leadership. A few passages, however, left me troubled and even sad.  First, the sadness. Early in the book, Sandberg reveals that even though she was voted ""Most Likely to Succeed"" in high school, she did the unthinkable: She convinced a friend on the yearbook staff to remove her name to avoid taking ""any chances with the prom."" What?! It's so sad to read about self-sabotage in the name of dating. When I was honored with the title, I did not become a megalomaniac (as least as I remember it), but it was nice to be recognized. (Little did I know it would complicate my conversations at our reunions.)  A key strength of the book, however, is precisely this type of admission from an accomplished, unlikely source, which could teach girls important lessons. Indeed, the confession fits in nicely with the chapter I most endorse titled, ""Don't Leave Before You Leave,"" which begins with a funny -- but also sad -- story of a young woman at Facebook who was already asking work/family balance questions before she even had a boyfriend! Sandberg's advice is counterintuitive, but right: ""The time to scale back is when a break is needed or when a child arrives -- not before, and certainly not years in advance."" Allow me an ""Amen"" from the choir. 
Upon reading this, I realized I had followed this advice unconsciously, mainly because I was culturally conditioned as a man, but hopefully, future at-home mothers will follow it as well. My career trajectory after high school was clear: college, graduate school and a Ph. D. in American literature. Even though I met my wife in college, we thought very little about future kids and very much leaned into our career paths.   It was only when we became serious about starting a family that I started to weigh our financial future and childcare options. Eventually, I quit my job teaching at the University of Michigan, but I'm grateful I didn't lean out of my career path until a few years after I earned the terminal degree. Sandberg states that ""women rarely make one big decision to leave the workforce,"" but basically I did, and I'd recommend it to all young men and women fortunate enough to be able to consider at-home parenthood.   The key reason is that life today is far too uncertain to make oneself financially vulnerable until it is absolutely necessary. Any parent who takes over at-home parenting (even just part-time) has to worry a bit about the three-headed monster of potential divorce, widow(er)hood or a spouse/partner's job loss. (Feel free to picture me lecturing my daughters at this point, complete with eyerolls.) As my own former stay-at-home mother kept saying to me, ""At least you have your degree in case anything happens."" My wife often rolled her eyes at that one, but I now understand my mother's parenting version of ""hope for the best but prepare for the worst.""  Sandberg adds the valuable point that leaning into your career just before leaning out also gives you more leverage when it's time to re-enter the workforce. This is not to say one should deceive a future employer if one is about to quit. And yes, placement committees might take issue with this type of advice, but scaling back your professional plans does not necessarily mean you will never use your credentials again.   And now for my trouble with Sandberg's book, which is her dating advice. She advises women to date ""all"" the boys when looking for a worthy partner: ""the bad boys, the cool boys, the commitment-phobic boys, the crazy boys."" Excuse me? I know she says don't marry the crazies, but I would have preferred she take the advice Eric Schmidt at Google gave her about how to choose the best careers and apply it to how to choose the best dates: ""potential for growth."" While a young woman is dating the crazies, she could be missing out on Mr. Potential for Growth!   Fortunately, Sandberg concludes her dating advice by recommending women find someone ""who wants an equal partner."" She even claims that domestically supportive men become sexier over time, citing a book called Porn for Women that shows scenes of men cleaning the kitchen and tending to the baby. Now I have fodder for the next reunion: Perhaps I should have been voted Most Likely to Become a Porn Star?   Late in the book, Sandberg provides an inspiring look to future generations: ""The homes we create tend to be more rooted in our childhoods."" Again, amen. This concept struck home for me when my wife, my 12-year-old daughter and I happened upon the ""Makers: Women Who Make America"" series on PBS. As each woman told her story, I couldn't help noticing what we were doing during the show: I was folding laundry, my wife was on the phone with the hospital and most significantly, my daughter was oblivious to both our activities. The show mentioned the subject of ""women's work,"" and I had to remind myself that my daughters think ""women's work"" involves performing laser surgery and running staff meetings. (My daughter also didn't understand the bra-burning scene, but I let her mother handle that one.)  As a stay-at-home father, I have ""leaned way in"" to my family, and it was the right arrangement for us. But I always try to remind myself of the luxury of my choice and remain grateful for my, yes, different kind of success. As Sandberg notes, however, there are many obstacles in an at-home dad's path, especially at the beginning. Her chapter on the need for more mentors for women with leadership ambitions reads like a mirror image of the need for more mentors for men with domestic ambitions. 
My first year as an at-home father with a colicky baby was especially difficult, but outlets like a local Early Childhood PTA (full of welcoming moms, thankfully) and later, a small dads' group I organized in my area became invaluable. For anyone in a similar situation, I recommend finding/creating such groups for support, as well as visiting the websites for larger organizations like the National At-Home Dad Network and the New York City Dads Group. I agree with Sandberg: We need to make both men and women more likely to succeed, whatever their professional or domestic ambitions.

583,PARENTING,The Power of Corn Starch,"Jamie Anne Richardson, Contributor
Author, Mother",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parenting-fears_us_5b9bb5d9e4b03a1dcc79c6ef,"hen I was growing up, my parents worried about me getting in a fistfight after school. Now parents have to worry about guns and knives in the school cafeteria.",2012-05-14,FAMILY,"I never knew cornstarch could be so scary. I have used it to thicken gravy, but I would have never considered its abilities to lock down a school.
But behold... it is indeed that powerful.
A few weeks ago, I headed to my kids' elementary school campus and, while in the carpool line for afternoon pickup, I saw a notice on Facebook that announced there was a police presence on the high school campus. Fifteen minutes later, one of the other elementary schools within the district was covered by emergency vehicles as well.
My heart sank. All I could think was, ""please, I just want my babies in my truck. NOW.""
It would be over an hour before the details would be released. Someone, somewhere, sent a white powder to several school in the Dallas metroplex. More was found in other states. Packages were sent to museums, businesses and banks. Weeks later, packages are still being delivered to daycares, schools and churches.
The powder is cornstarch.
Teenage gunmen I am pretty used to. I grow cold to the nightly reports of bullied kids fighting back. But in my mind, you have a chance against a gun. As cold as it sounds, more kids will walk out of the school doors than will be hit by bullets. (Which is all well and good unless YOUR kid is the one in the crossfire.) Statistically speaking, you have a better chance of dying in a crash on the way to school than by being hit by a bullet while at school.
But, white powder... that is another problem all together. A release of that nature has a much higher casualty rate, I would think.
My motherly instinct immediately went into protection mode. Homeschooling actually crossed my mind. But then another story hit the headlines when an explosion occurred at a retirement home that happened to house a meth lab in a back room.
There is no ""safe place"" any more. A loon could walk into Walmart with an automatic weapon if he wanted to. 
I am uncomfortable with the fact that I may have to teach my kids to not run in a straight line if there is a gunman on their campus before I have to teach them about sex. When I was growing up, my parents worried about me getting in a fistfight after school. Now parents have to worry about guns and knives in the school cafeteria. My parents worried about cigarettes and alcohol. Now there is meth in the locker room.
Where did we go wrong? And where do we go from here?
When gravy thickener at an elementary school begins looking like a terrorist threat, it is time to rethink our parenting strategies. We can't just turn off the news and put our heads in the proverbial sand. We have to come up with a way for keeping our kids safe that doesn't involve gas masks and bullet-proof vests.
Living in a trailer in the woods is looking better all the time.

I am thankful my kids haven't realized that I have no clue what I'm doing.,2013-11-27,FAMILY,"I was recently sent a group Facebook question asking me to name one thing I'm thankful for that isn't cliché or traditional. Other people were coming back with beautiful sentiments about new friendships, the help of strangers, and averting disasters, which in my opinion wasn't really following the rules at all. If that's not the traditional stuff, then what is?
I didn't respond because everything I thought of seemed trite, superficial, and a tad less profound -- even though I'm pretty sure that was the point. Whatever, Facebook people who don't follow directions.
Well, I did write a list because these things totally deserve thanks, in my book and you'll probably agree -- just refrain from saying them around the dinner table.
1. I am thankful for the dimmer switch in my bedroom.
2. I am thankful my kids can't decode my Momisms, like the fact that ""Let's play the quiet game"" really means: ""Stop talking, my ears are bleeding."" Or ""One day you'll thank me"" really means: ""Hopefully, we'll all forget this ever happened.""
3. I am thankful my daughter has not lost faith in the tooth fairy, and my son goes along with it.
4. I am thankful that I don't look anything like the portraits my kids draw of me, seriously... they're pretty bad.
5. I am thankful that I haven't had to clean up pee (kid's, pet's, or otherwise) once this week.
6. I am thankful for those awesome skinny hangers that make my closet seem bigger.
7. I am thankful that on my last date night I stayed out past 10, which means I didn't have to circle the block five times to make sure the kiddos were asleep and the sitter didn't look down on us for being so lame.
8. I am thankful for stars like Courteney Cox, Jennifer Aniston, Heidi Klum, and J.Lo, who make being 40 seem not so old.
9. I am thankful sweetener packets can be used as makeshift floss -- in a pinch.
10. I am thankful my kids are finally at an age where they'll watch my shows with me, instead of making me watch their shows with them. I'm pretty sure Disney XD was causing my brain to atrophy.
11. I am thankful that my son still waves to me when a bunch of his friends are huddled together at the bus stop.
12. I'm thankful I can still get away with some bold-faced Mommy lies like: ""I'm sorry the arcade is closed on Sundays"" or ""Harry Styles hates girls who don't listen to their parents.""
13. I'm thankful for Jon Hamm and his massive package -- which has made me consider converting. What? Hamm isn't kosher.
14. I am thankful for The Voice, but mostly Adam Levine because he's not only the sexiest man alive, but also the Jewish mom's Jon Hamm.
15. I am thankful that there's a pair of tweezers in my car.
16. I am thankful for my besties, who will tell me if my butt looks fat when it actually looks fat, or pretend they need me to fix their bra strap, to save me from a tedious conversation.
17. I am thankful my kids are old enough to figure out how to buckle seatbelts, wipe themselves, and use step stools to reach things.
18. I am thankful they ask me to lie with them at bedtime, despite their self-sufficiency.
19. I am thankful for Netflix, which allows me to watch shows that started six seasons ago and end in a month. (I will be more thankful when there is a Netflix Anonymous.)
20. I am thankful I haven't tripped over or stepped on: a Lego, Barbie, ball, skateboard, drum stick, puzzle piece, My Little Pony, or something from a Happy Meal even once today (that may be a record).
21. I am thankful Deep Lichen Green is the new black -- it's really the unsung hero of slimming colors that one can barely pronounce.
22. I am thankful for Lycra.
23. I am thankful that no one judges me when I'm at carpool, or Starbucks, or the grocery store -- braless, wearing Uggs and pajama pants -- which probably isn't true, because I totally judge them.
24. I am thankful my kids haven't realized that I have no clue what I'm doing.
25. I am thankful for the $20 bill I found in my jeans yesterday -- that's always exciting.
Don't get me wrong, I'm beyond thankful for traditional stuff as well, but it's super cathartic to mention the stuff that might get you kicked out of Thanksgiving dinner.
Try it, I promise not to judge. What is the most nontraditional/superficial thing you're thankful for?

In,2012-09-21,FAMILY,"A surprising number of parents believe that early exposure to alcohol will discourage children from drinking in adolescence and help prevent alcohol abuse later on, according to a new study from the RTI International and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
The study, which was published this week in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, looked at data collected from 1,050 mothers and their third-grade children, according to Science Daily. 
Forty percent of mothers believe that trying to ban children from even tasting alcohol will only make it more appealing (the so-called ""forbidden fruit"" theory). In addition, 33 percent of third graders in the study had already had beer, wine or other alcohol.
“This finding indicates that many parents mistakenly expect that the way children drink at home, under parental supervision, will be replicated when children are with peers,” public health analyst Christine Jackson, a leader of the study, told TODAY.com.
In fact, the majority of evidence contradicts these perceptions, Jackson said, and adolescents are unlikely to model the responsible drinking habits of their parents when out partying with their friends. 
For example, fifth-grade students whose parents allowed them to have alcohol were twice as likely to report recent alcohol use in seventh grade, the study points out.
Access to alcohol also plays a large role in whether or not underage kids drink. 
In 2011, a national study of 12- to 14-year-olds who said they drink also said they get their alcohol for free from their family, according to MyHealthNewDaily.
""People who begin drinking alcohol before the age of 15 are six times more likely than those who start at age 21 and older to develop alcohol problems,"" said Pamela Hyde, Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) which ran the study.
A study published in the Archives of General Psychiatrystressed that substance abuse most often takes root in adolescence, Reuters reported in April. The median age of onset for alcohol abuse, with or without ""dependence,"" was 14 years old.
It's not just an American problem, either. The Irish Minister for Health, Roisin Shortall, suggested in January that parents who allow their teens to drink in the home may be contributing to substance abuse in young people, according to the BBC.
According to Ralph Hingson, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's Division of Epidemiology and Prevention Research, the best thing for parents to do if they actually want to keep their kids safe is to ""delay alcohol exposure for as long as possible,"" TODAY.com reports.
Parents would also be wise to think of the potential legal implications of allowing or encouraging underage drinking. In July, a Pheonix mother was arrested and charged with child abuse after allowing her 2-year-old to drink beer out of his sippy cup. Valerie Marie Topete admitted giving the alcohol to her child, saying her toddler kept reaching for the pitcher, according to CBS News.

He is mine, all wrapped up in a blanket on a hospital bed. He is hooked up to machines and I am worried. Every time I pick him up, his heartbeat gets weaker. When I put him down, it gets strong again. The doctors and nurses assure me that this is normal. I have done nothing wrong. It will be our life from now on. I can hold him sometimes, but not for too long. More often than not, I will need to give him space, let him be. I am told it is the best thing for his heart. I tell them it is the worst thing for mine. In the dream, I surrender, willing to care for him the best I can. The message is clear, I need to learn a whole new way to love. I wake up in a deep state of longing and realize, I am grieving. My child is changing and I am mourning.
I cannot remember the last time I sang you a bedtime song, shared a blanket with you, trimmed your fingernails, pushed you on a swing, tied your shoes or cut your chicken at dinner. I do not know what the inside of your locker looks like, who you sit with on the bus, or what you choose for lunch in the cafeteria. You are messy. You hurl your backpack down and raid the cabinets for food deemed only mildly satisfactory. You bark orders for money, slam doors, curse under your breath, and list things you hate. I have made this list more than once. You demand a cell phone, R rated movies, and endless time on the computer. You listen to music with swagger and edge that blares into headphones for only you. You are fresh and fast with a comeback, always.
It has become my job to remind you that a pile of blankets in a heap doesn't mean that a bed has been made. I push you to finish your poetry project, change your socks, wear your retainer, write your thank you notes, lay off the candy. I can't be too excited or too disappointed. My heart must not shatter with sadness or burst with pride or I lose you. You ride high and bottom out almost daily. But I cannot join you. I try to stand back, offer support, let it play out. The impact of my consequences have almost no outward effect, my approval seems to matter the least, and it's becoming rarer for you to back down.
Whenever you lash out, pull away or retreat, I want to reach inside you and pull out the boy who loved Buzz Lightyear and never criticized the Red Sox or his mother. I long for the boy who would wear costumes in public, leap from furniture, and dance wildly, red faced and sweaty from play and imagination. I desperately want to capture you and frantically run away to a distant amusement park on a random Wednesday when you're scheduled to take a math test. We'll race together from the giant water slides to the crazy roller coasters and eat fried dough until we're sick. We'll waste money, laugh until it hurts, and you'll hold my hand and squeal that I'm the greatest... of all time... ever. We'll return home to a permanent state of bliss and skip the betrayal of a temporary fix.
I stay at your bedside, aching for you to share one piece of your day. I am consumed by the potential of a meaningful conversation. You start to share your social woes and I am on the edge of my seat, undivided attention abounds. But you trail off, mumbling that I won't understand. I scrounge for details from my middle school days to validate you and show I can relate. I get it! I was just there! You assure me things are different now. I nod. They sure are.
I look over at your younger brother, waiting patiently to be tucked in, while I'm all consumed in your adolescence. This is a harsh reminder of your growth and the precious passing of time. He needs me more constantly. You, in more intense, immediate spurts. But tonight I must go to him because the days are slipping on all of us. And when I find him where you are, I will long for this night and these struggles and victories -- so overwhelming to me now, so strangely simple and innocent to me tomorrow.
We are crossing over. You are my baby. But I cannot carry you now. You walk alone into a new world. I want you to linger here, but you constantly push. You will change. You will grow. You will stumble. You will rise. I will be soft and firm. I will guide and step aside. I will lean and I will pull. I will be lost and I will be certain. I will reach for you, and if you do not reach back, know that my heart remembers your heartbeat. And I will always be holding you there.

Plans change.",2012-06-15,FAMILY,"My wife and I entered parenthood later than most of our peers. We married young, 22 and 25 respectively, but coming from Salt Lake City, Utah, that seemed perfectly normal. We chose not to start a family right away; it was just the two of us against the world, we were enough and, frankly, we had plans. 
Big plans.
My wife wanted to be working for the Secretary of Education by 30 and I vowed I'd have a mantle covered with TONYs, Oscars and Emmys by the time I was 40.
My wife has been successful in her career but, while creatively fulfilled, my mantle is surprisingly void of golden statuettes. However, it is covered with Play-Doh dinosaurs and colorful finger paint landscapes... or maybe they're elephants... or cars.
And they're the most important treasures I have.
Plans change.
When we found out we were expecting, we immediately began planning. My wife works at a university in New York and I was working at a cable network during the day and performing in the evenings. We began pulling together as much paid leave as we could. (A tragic reality for those of us living in one of three countries (of 178) without paid maternity leave... but that's another post.) We came up with twelve weeks for my wife and then I would stay at home and take over. 
There was no discussion. It was decided. She makes more money and, since insurance is tied to employment in this country (again, another post) we certainly couldn't rely on the wing-and-a-prayer weeks-of-work system Actor's Equity or the Screen Actors Guild provides. Rather than keep my temporary day job to pay someone else to raise our child, I would stay home. It has not only become my full time job, it is my calling. I can't imagine doing it any other way. My only regret is that my wife can't experience it. 
However, first big movie, we have a second child, we switch roles... That's the deal.
In the two years since our son, whom we have nicknamed Turtle and Mr. Man, came into our lives, I've learned much about children, parenting and myself. I work hard NOT to be that parent who gives advice to other parents; I'm a firm believer that everyone has their own journey. However, it's Father's Day and I get to do whatever I want. (That's the way it works, right?) 
Here are a few things I've learned. 
It's all about logistics and the big picture.  I come from the world of the theatre. You have to be on spot X by line A or the big picture, the story, gets muddy. As a parent, I find myself thinking about logistics all the time. ""I'm going into the city today. Should I wear Turtle in his Mei Tai or should I lug the stroller around? How hot will it be? It's 80 degrees now. Short sleeves. Might rain later? Jacket and a stroller cover. How much milk do we have? Where can I stop and grab more? Do I need to take some with me? Should we just wing it? Will I be near Shake Shack or Milk Bar? How can I alter my route to ensure I am?"" (You don't need to suffer, right? This is supposed to be fun.) This will take five minutes as you prepare yourself for your day, but it makes all the difference when you're out on the road.
It's not a contest. So, your friend's child is the same age as yours and can walk, talk and do quadratic equations at 6 months... Who cares? Turtle was the last of his birth class buddies to crawl and walk. He's also four inches taller than most 2-year-olds. Big deal. By the time he goes off to college he will be running, potty trained and able to put on his pants by himself. 
This is also applicable to ""stuff."" You don't need that $1000 stroller. Sure, drool over the one your friend got from that rich uncle, but take that $1000 and put it into a college fund or something. A fancy baby bag is nice and I have one that has literally come apart at the seams in just six months. (The company has been kind enough to replace it.) My army/navy store Alice pack? Bulletproof. Holds two baby bottles, a water bottle, diapers, pads, jackets, swaddles, toys, it's cavernous, kind of ugly... and $20. (It was also the perfect counterweight to Mr. Man snuggled into his Mei Tai.)
In parenting, gender doesn't matter, skill sets do. There's been a lot written about what Mothers and Fathers do better. It's all nonsense. Skill sets are more important than gender. I am a better cook than my wife, always have been. I worked in kitchens from the time I could legally hold a job and I spent much time at my mother and grandmothers' sides, learning. That's part of my skill set. My wife is amazing when it comes to the evening routine: take a bath, comfy comfy, sing songs, story-time, sleepy sleepy. She is quicker to get silly with him, tells better tales, nurtures differently -- gentle, quiet. It's part of her skill set. We are great at stepping in with little fanfare when our skill set is needed. Perhaps it's because we came to be parents after 15 years of figuring out how best we work together. 
Think like a Marine (adapt, overcome, improvise). No face wipes? Do you have a handkerchief and a bottle of water? Nothing is so dire that you need to freak out. Take a breath, assess, you'll be fine. As my mother used to say, ""Don't sweat the small stuff... P.S., it's all small stuff."" Breath. Assess. Find a solution. Move on.
Forget pride and ask experts. Dr. Sears, Dr. Harvey Karp, the ladies at Metro Minis in NYC, my mother and mother in-law. These were some of my resources. What are yours?
Love is limitless. You will believe yourself incapable of loving someone as much as you love your child in this very moment -- then you wake up the next morning, see your kid wake up, fuss, ask incessantly for a ""bobble"" and your love grows exponentially. This happens every day.
Note to SAHM's:  ""I am not a predator and I'm not invading your turf. I'm just a dad. Also, you are much sexier than that 25-year-old nanny. Just ask your husband.""
No, being an SAHD does not lead to weaker men. There are people who contend that the increase in SAHDs is giving rise to men losing their rightful spot in the hierarchy of the workplace and that the role is emasculating. This is utter hogwash. These are also the same people who insist women are worth 25% less than men and are laboring to undermine the ability of American women to make autonomous health care decisions. These people should be actively ignored.
Yes, being an SAHD does up your sexy factor.  Not just to the flirty barista, but to your wife or partner. Ask my wife.  You are raising a small adult. Remember that. They are learning from you every moment of every day. They learn your habits, your most colorful language, how you hold your fork, the way you brush your teeth, and they emulate it all. You are their master teacher, their Sifu. This also means they are learning and emulating your biases, bigotry, ignorance and hatred. These are taught. Now is the time to address these things in yourself.
Taking care of yourself IS taking care of your child.  I'm the 40-year-old father of a 2-year-old. I'd like to see him graduate college, get married, and, someday, hold his children. Take care of yourself. Join a gym, start Crossfitting, ride your bike, pick up something heavy every day, stop eating meat, go paleo, whatever. Do anything and everything to keep yourself alive. Take your vitamins. My vitamin and supplement regiment would make Robert Downey, Jr. smile. Meditate, pray, or just find quiet time to read. You can find the time. Trust me. If you can't or won't take care of yourself, there's no way you can take care of your child.

590,PARENTING,Donna's Cancer Story: Chemo Starts,"Sheila Quirke, Contributor
Mary Tyler Mom",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donnas-cancer-story-chemo_us_5b9c37fce4b03a1dcc7d2ff2,"The first month was terrifying for us. We did what we needed to do and were grateful for the opportunity; grateful for the ability to inject poison into our girl's thin, tiny veins, if that is what it took to rid her of cancer.",2012-09-04,FAMILY,"This is the fourth of thirty-one installments of Donna's Cancer Story, which will appear daily in serial format through the month of September to recognize Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. Each post will cover one month of Donna's thirty-one months of cancer treatment.   It's hard to believe, but yesterday's entry only covered two weeks of the third month of Donna's treatment. There was simply too much happening to document it all, which is a bit like this month, too. Donna's cancer, to use an analogy, was very much like the stock market; the ups and downs are exhausting. The best strategy is simply to focus on what is happening right in the moment you are in and deal with the future as it comes. If it comes. 
Chemo was hard on Donna. I mean, she was a tiny girl, under 25 pounds. The regimen that was selected was known as ""ICE."" It required five inpatient hospital days to administer, including time for pre-hydration and post-hydration to help flush the toxins out of her system. An oncologist acquaintance referred to it as the ""sledgehammer"" of chemo cocktails. 
The first month was terrifying for us. We did what we needed to do and were grateful for the opportunity; grateful for the ability to inject poison into our girl's thin, tiny veins, if that is what it took to rid her of cancer. Triple sigh. When Donna was first discharged, we received a home health order, meaning a nurse would be coming and supplies would be sent so that we could manage Donna's IV and medicine needs in the comfort of our home. That adds stress to an already stressful situation, but you buck up and do what needs doing. That is the life of a Cancer Parent.
With the first round of chemo there was vomiting, loss of appetite, lethargy and the thinning of Donna's hair. Her beautiful curls were going away. It's such a vain thing, but ask any Cancer Mom and she will tell you -- this hurts like hell. Donna slogged through it, finding comfort in our arms and the distraction of TV and YouTube. Our parenting standards went away with Donna's hair. If potato chips, TV and staying up late brought her comfort, so be it, we would work through the consequences later.

We returned home, grappled with the King of Sucky Home Health Agencies and did the best we could to comfort Donna and tend to her needs. This was heartbreakingly difficult, as there was a battle going on within her body between chemo and her cells, both healthy and unhealthy, that brough almost constant discomfort. Nothing was good enough. Food, books, videos, TV shows; all were met with the plaintive wail of Donna yelling, ""SOMETHING ELSE!"" 
But we got through it. Amidst the discomfort, Donna developed neutropenia, the phase of treatment where your immune system collapses, making you vulnerable to opportunistic bugs. Infections can kill. We went back into the hospital after a long and tedious ER stay and were brought to our room in the oncology unit. I immediately walked to the nurse's desk and said, ""I think there's been a mistake. Donna is neutropenic and needs an isolation room."" God bless her, the nurse patiently explained that most of the kids on the floor were neutropenic. If she rolled her eyes, it was only after I walked away. The single room we enjoyed during the chemo infusion was simply good luck. 
Miraculously, Donna recovered after a couple of days and returned to good health. No infection developed, but she received days of IV antibiotics until our docs felt assured that there wouldn't be one. We went home to pack. That's right, pack. Thinking there was not enough going on in our lives, we had bought a new home. What the what? Yep, just days before Donna's diagnosis, we had put a bid on a new place not a mile from our old place. We were given the opportunity to back out when the developer learned of Donna's cancer, but we opted to move forward. It seemed a hopeful choice to us and one Donna fully endorsed. 
 I just shake my head when when I remember the insanity of this month. A few bags were packed and sent to a friend's home while they vacationed. A boatload of believers had a packing party for us and knocked it out over a day and a half. Movers came and when we returned to our home, it was a new home, just half a block away from Donna's favorite park. We had been unpacked by another crew of volunteers. Donna loved it, we all did. I would spend the next several months finding things others had unpacked for me, never forgetting how amazing human beings can be. Who hasn't fantasized about someone else packing, moving and unpacking you? That was one of the gifts that cancer brought us.
The plan for Donna was to have her rescanned a few weeks after the first chemo to determine if it was having the effect that was hoped for. Again, no roadmap, just hopes. The docs were pleased with her recovery -- this was hard to imagine, as we saw our girl shrinking and sad and thinning before our eyes. They saw a girl who had no infection and a quickly recovered immune system. Recovery is in the eyes of the beholder. Our oncologist suggested pushing up the scan dates to capitalize on Donna's health. Gulp. 
The MRI was performed at 6:30 a.m. on July 3. We got home about 11:30 that night, Donna wired and hungry from not eating since early that morning. The next day was quite possibly the longest day of my life. Donna played, Mary Tyler Dad kept her company and I nursed my anxieties with television, chocolate, soda and pajamas. Happy 4th of July, folks! On the 5th, unable to stand it a single second longer, I called our RN. The CT looked good, but the final read on her MRI was not complete. Given our history with hearing too-early interpretations of scan results, they were extra careful. A couple of hours later we got the call: Donna's lung lesions were significantly diminished. There was a clean spine and the residual brain tumor had remained stable. RELIEF. The chemo was working. Suddenly, we did have a roadmap. More of the same, possibly 4-6 more months. Bring it. We were on top of the world. Donna was strong and if she could handle it, so could we.
In the midst of this chaos, our friends had organized a benefit in our honor. They were worried about Donna's medical expenses and insurance and wanted to do what they could. This was so very humbling, to be on the receiving end of such generosity, and I fear to this day I will never be able to repay what people did for us in Donna's name. 
A few days after that, Donna turned 2. We celebrated with a platelet transfusion. Unexpected as it was -- we got the call at 2 p.m. -- the need was urgent and could not be postponed. Donna was okay with that. For her, it was a hospital day with two parents instead of one. And the docs and nurses gifted her beautifully wrapped presents and sang the happy birthday song. Our girl was 2!

591,PARENTING,Who Leaves Their Kids Behind at Chuck E. Cheese?,"Jen M.L., Contributor
Author, People I Want to Punch in the Throat: Competitive Craf...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chuck-e-cheese_us_5b9b74a4e4b03a1dcc77b367,This just goes to show it might not be a bad idea to give a standardized test to all new parents before they leave the hospital with their new babies.  Seriously!  You have to jump through more hoops to adopt a dog than you do to have a baby.,2012-03-16,FAMILY,"Well, as long as parents like these exist, I don't need to worry about getting the World's Worst Parenting Award. WTF, people? Seriously? Two kids in one week left at Chuck E. Cheese?!
I can almost get how this could happen. Chuck E. Cheese is mind-numbing and being trapped there for several hours could have the same effect on you as waterboarding or other various forms of torture. You come out of your stupor and find yourself curled in the fetal position in a booth behind the Whack-a-Mole. You glance at your watch and realize the joint is closing in ten minutes and there's no way in hell you're going to spend the night. You grab your kid and stumble out. It isn't until hours later that your ears stop ringing and you gain some clarity and realize, Oh shit! I took two kids to Chuck E. Cheese's and only came home with one!
Only it didn't happen this way. Instead, one family took their 5-year-old to CEC to celebrate her birthday and forgot her. The family has ten kids and so the birthday girl wasn't missed until the next morning when it was time for school.
Where do I begin with this? It was her birthday and nobody missed her until the next day? Nobody thought, ""I want give Little Birthday Girl one more kiss and wish her one more Happy Birthday before I tuck her into bed""? I can't tell you how sad this makes me.
I am not the perfect mom by any stretch of the imagination, but if I'm home I tuck my kids into bed. If I'm at work when they go to bed, I kiss them after I get home and they're asleep. Does no one tuck Little Birthday Girl into bed? For some reason this upsets me more than the fact they left her behind. I can understand that in the hubbub of getting everyone out the door you think Auntie or Grandma has Little Birthday Girl in her car and you accidentally forget her. But you forget her until morning?? Poor Little Birthday Girl.
I get that they have a big family and it can be easy to lose someone, but don't big families use the buddy system or something? Don't big families learn from the Waltons to always do a roll call at the end of each night? Good night, Mary Ellen. Good night, Elizabeth. Good night, Jim Bob. Good night, John Boy. Good night, Little Birthday Girl. Little Birthday Girl? Has anyone seen Little Birthday Girl? OH MY GOD! We left her at Chuck E. Cheese!
The second family that left their child at Chuck E. Cheese this week didn't realize she was missing until they watched the nightly news and saw her face on television. This one amazes me more than the big family one. I imagine the big family parents are busy, busy, busy with all their kids and their night time routines and everyone looks the same and they're moving so fast no one can really get an accurate count of how many are there. I imagine it wasn't like that at the second girl's home. I imagine this girl's family sitting on the couch, relaxing with a cold drink and seeing her picture on the news. I imagine her mother spitting her cold drink all over the TV when her daughter's picture comes up.
The parents of this little girl share custody of her and they were both at the party, but they assumed she went home with a relative. Ummm....wouldn't you double check that? (I'm guessing they will next time.)
This just goes to show it might not be a bad idea to give a standardized test to all new parents before they leave the hospital with their new babies. Seriously! You have to jump through more hoops to adopt a dog than you do to have a baby and I'm guessing these parents shouldn't even have a dog, let alone a kid.
I have a large extended family and my kids love to ride in grandma's car or their aunt's car. The difference is, my family comes to me and says, ""Gomer wants to go with me. You OK with that?"" They would never just take my kids without telling me and I would never assume they had my kids when I got home and I didn't.
It's ironic, because I hate to go to CEC and one of the reasons (besides the obvious exposure to Black Plague) is that I'm always worried my kids will get snatched by some creepy pedophile. I worry, because it's literally impossible to keep my eye on both of my kids in that place since they run off in different directions. I worry that they'll think I've left them there and so they'll leave the building to see if my car is still in the parking lot and they get run over. (Yes, it's difficult for me to sleep at night with all this insane worrying. These are just my CEC worries -- now you see why I'm not crazy about the beach!) However, these two stories showed me that CEC might be one of the safest places for my kids. These little girls were left on their own and no one barely noticed them, let alone tried to snatch them. Maybe I've been too hard on CEC. Maybe I could use CEC like a cheap drop in babysitting place. I could give my kids a roll of tokens and tell them I'll see them in three hours?

592,PARENTING,Raise Your Hand If Letting Go Of Your Kid Is Easy... Anyone??,"Mindy Trotta, Contributor
Social Media Manager, Betterafter50.com Writer, Relocationtheb...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/raise-your-hand-if-letting-go-of-your-kid-is-easy_us_5b9d7ad4e4b03a1dcc8886e7,"If anyone ever tells you that it gets easier to send your kid off to college with each successive kid and with each successive year, they're lying.",2013-09-03,FAMILY,"There was a goodbye ritual that occurred at the end of every summer of my childhood...
As the cars, piled high with suitcases and summer paraphernalia, would begin to exit the parking lot of the bungalow colony where we had just spent the last two months, the owners of the place would stand in a line, banging on some old pots with metal spoons and sing, ""We hate to see ya go, we hate to see ya go..."" It was a send-off like no other and as the cars lumbered out of the lot en masse, I would turn around in my seat (you could do that back then) and look out the rear window. I watched the line of people and pots that were staying behind slowly vanish from view as we headed down the road, but I could still hear the sound of the banging (and the horns blowing) lingering for a while longer until we hit the highway.
I would've loved to have brought some pots and pans with me to express my feelings in the noisiest of ways this morning when we dropped off my youngest son at the airport, but I held back. There was just enough time for a long hug... and then another... and then another. And then he was gone.
If anyone ever tells you that it gets easier to send your kid off to college with each successive kid and with each successive year, they're lying.
There are many things written by parents about the emotional turmoil they experience when they give a final hug and squeeze to their freshman as they leave that child behind. The complexity of the mishmash of feelings is staggering: the angst, the utter pride that is intertwined with melancholy and happiness,= and, though I've been through it before many times over, that initial emptiness. It's what Erma Bombeck describes as feeling ""as if you are on center stage and suddenly all the lights go out and no one even warned you.""
The proverbial lights still go out when your senior wends his way down that path. But it is different: I no longer worry about whether he can handle the workload or social pressures like I did when he was a freshman. I now worry about whether he will be able to find a job with that degree he'll be getting in May. As much as I feel that last bit of metaphorical cord slipping through my fingers, I now wonder if I am going to need to eventually ravel some back. It's the old tug of war, that push and pull of emotions... wanting them to come back, not wanting them to come back, wanting them to want to come back, but hoping they don't really need to.
The sad reality of it all for college grads is so many of them do need to come back. In April of this year, CNN reported, ""The Class of 2013 will face an 'extremely difficult' job market when college students graduate in the months ahead, according to a new research report."" And just last week, the Chicago Tribune stated that more millennials than ever are now living with their parents. The reasons vary from emotional to financial, but mostly financial. So, the odds are rather ""good"" that my son will need a place to roost as he pounds the pavement.
I always believed that our job was to raise these children and give them a set of wings. Not Icarus wings, but good, sturdy ones... eagles' wings. Wings that can support the burdens and good fortunes that will be their own, the accomplishments and successes that will sit side-by-side in their bags and backpacks and suitcases... and their own homes. It's disheartening to think that those wings are being clipped, and not necessarily by parents, but by factors beyond their reach.
When I left my parents' house for good to move into my own apartment in New York City, my mom, ever the drama queen, pulled me aside, looked me in the eyes and asked, ""Why are you leaving me?"" The woman was usually pretty good with giving advice, whether I wanted it or not, but that day, she just couldn't pull any pearls of wisdom out of her hat... just a plaintive cry. I'm sure that once I'd gone... perhaps months later, she bragged to her friends how independent I was. And knowing Mom, she patted herself on the back for raising such a free-spirited soul. But as she clutched my sleeve that day, while I tried to hightail it outta there (that really didn't happen, but it certainly felt like it did), I promised myself I would do better when I had children of my own. No guilt trips, no making them feel sorry for growing up. And I worked very hard to fulfill that promise: I love my kids, but I want them to go out into the world and experience all that I did. It's a slippery slope.
So, this morning, as much as the pots and pans would have lent a little levity to the moment, they stayed at home. And it took all I had to not chant that chant I learned so many years ago. I recently learned that, ironically, the third line of that farewell song is, ""We hope to heck you never come back."" Had I sung that one, my son surely would have laughed-he knows that's not true. He knows he can always come back, but he's got those wings now... and just one more year of school. And as much as I hate to see him go (and would love him to return), I'll watch what I wish for... because ""go"" is what he must do.

She was still giggling from the sprint we had made from the car into the house, and I was attempting to take off her wet jeans and replace them with nice, warm, dry pants (which was no easy feat). Her once-perfect-ponytail was a lopsided mess, complete with a wet bow hanging by a few strands of hair. As I took out the blow dryer and began alternating between drying her hair and my own, I realized these are the moments I'll cherish. 
I absolutely, whole-heartedly love, with every ounce of my being, these little day-to-day moments of spontaneous bonding.
It isn't the preplanned activities, play dates and/or numerous outings that I'll remember forever. Sure, those have made for some great photo ops and we have had a blast exploring new adventures and making memories, but it's these little girl moments that only a mother-daughter relationship can share that have found their place in my heart.
I took her ponytail holder and put it in my own hair and thought to myself, my sweet baby is growing up into a little girl. On the surface, it's just sharing a hair tie and the simple act of drying our hair together, but if you dig deeper, it's become so much more than that. 
It's these ""girly"" things that I have come to love, that I just wouldn't be able to experience had my firstborn been a boy.
It's the fact that after she is dressed, her hand immediately goes to her head and she says, ""bow?"" 
It's that, at only 18 months old, she already has an opinion on what clothes and shoes she wears. Trust me, I know this is cute now, but I am sure at some point it won't be so cute anymore. 
It's the fact that I secretly love how obsessed she is with the movie Frozen, because of it's not-so-subtle girl power undertones (overtones?), despite the fact that I have to watch it over and over and over at home, on the iPad and in the car. 
And it's the fact that no one, I mean no one, rocks a mini skirt like she does. Even if it does cover her entire legs because she is so petite. Because little girls are allowed to be petite, while boys are labeled ""short.""
I haven't made it a secret that having a baby was a lot harder than I had ever expected. It wasn't the pregnancy part that did me in, but rather those first few months of endless cries, these on-again-off-again bouts of teething that disrupt everything, the worrying, and the anxiety...oh, the anxiety.
To put it lightly, it hasn't all been sunshine and roses.
But today, ironically enough, amidst a thunderstorm, it was all sunshine and roses. And I loved the little girl moment we got to share, even if it did have us dripping wet on the bathroom floor.

595,PARENTING,What to REALLY Expect When You're Expecting,"Rachel Hollis, Contributor
TheChicSite.com, Author, Lifestyle Expert, Blogger, Public Spe...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/advice-for-new-moms_us_5b9cbfd9e4b03a1dcc81783c,"Motherhood is a beautiful, wonderful gift... except when it's not.",2013-02-09,FAMILY,"Let's go ahead and get the preliminaries out of the way.
I love my kids.
They are the greatest thing I've ever done with my life and they bring me joy every day.
Motherhood is a beautiful, wonderful gift ... except when it's not.
I know, some of you are gasping for breath. You can't believe I'd disparage being a mom or my kids, but you know what? I'm just keeping it real here and I bet those of you not Googling the number for CPS are nodding along while reading, or possibly throwing out a ""Giiiiiirrrrrl"" or a ""Preach it, sister!"" And so here it is, the truth... as a new mom, nine out of ten days in your life will be awesome. And one day (or at least the culmination of 12 really terrible hours) will be the WORST.
I chose the title for this post because all of the baby books you read and the shows you watch while pregnant tell you what to ""expect."" But using the word ""expect"" implies that you have any clue what you're getting yourself into. You don't.
Oh sure, on some level you know that you'll have tough days and sleepless nights, but no one ever sits you down and says, ""Look, this is a crapshoot at best, so gird your loins!"" At least not until today... I'm giving it to you here. The worst of what to expect when you have a baby.
You're going to look and smell like a homeless yoga instructor.  I say look, because you'll basically live in any kind of workout clothing you own. On some level, putting it on will make you feel like there's a chance you'll squeeze in a workout today. But in reality, it's really just that the pants are stretchy and can accommodate that weird belly flab that still won't go away three months later. I mention smell for several reasons. The first of which is that a shower has now become a rarified privilege. 
The second is that even if you DO shower, the baby WILL puke on you the second you put on clean clothes. At some point, you'll get tired of changing your clothes and will just spend the day smelling like sour milk.
You're going get to over your modesty real fast.  I used to be modest. I started to lose that characteristic the first time a labor and delivery nurse went to check my dilation and turned me into a hand puppet. The modesty got shot completely to hell two days later when the orderly in charge of the breakfast delivery walked in on me crying over a failed attempt to breastfeed with both of my ginormous, milk-engorged boobs on full display. I was so hungry I didn't even care -- I would have flashed him far more for that tray of lukewarm scrambled eggs. 
The truth is, though, your body is at the disposal of another human, one that doesn't really care that you're in the middle of Target. So whip it out lady, there's no room for prudes up in here!
You're going to be emotional.  Did I say emotional? I meant emotional wreck! I meant full-on Personalities of Sybil. Between barking at your partner and yelling at your other kids and the good ole totally-defeated-cry-your-eyes-out-because-you're-a-terrible-mother-who-can't-get-this-baby-to-sleep, you're definitely going to wonder if you've lost your mind. And here's the truth, Mama: You have!
You're going to dread the nighttime.  Around 6:45 p.m., you might start to feel like you're going to be OK. Perhaps your fellow parent is home from work, perhaps you finagled some kind of dinner, perhaps you even managed a load of laundry. But as the sun starts to set, the dread sets in; it's getting dark. All around you, people start to get ready for their evening... maybe they watch TV or read books, and maybe you do those things too. But you know that eventually, it'll be bedtime and you'll start the hell-on-earth that is waking up every two hours to feed. For some reason it's not as bad during the day, but when it's dark and you know that everyone else gets to sleep while you fight baby to take the binky FOR-THE-LOVE-OF-GOD it messes with your head and your sense of what's fair.
You're going to hate baby daddy.  Not all the time, obviously. But there will be moments -- oh, sister, will there be moments. Even the most helpful dads (and in my generous moments, I'm willing to admit that I'm married to one of those) will challenge your self-control. For a lot of reasons (lack of mammary glands being one of them), you get the lion's share of newborn rearing. And that can make you feel like life isn't fair. For instance, when he talks about how he's tired. Then he'll sheepishly look at you and say something like, ""Well, I mean, obviously not as tired as you are sweetie, but man, I just couldn't get into a deep sleep last night"" 
Oh really? YOU couldn't get a deep sleep?! What was it that kept you up? The ultra soft mattress or the extra fuzzy blankets? Perhaps it was the gentle whisper of the breeze outside the window of the GUEST ROOM??? I didn't hear the whispering breeze... nope, I was too busy listening to the dulcet tones of our screaming child to catch that one, but golly, I'm sorry you missed your REM cycle, maybe you should take a nap.
Your body is going to be destroyed.  Okay, I'll qualify this and say that it is totally possible to get your body back. I've done it twice already (and God willing, I will this time, too) but for a while at least, it's like Chernobyl. First of all, there's the weight gain. If you're like me, there's a lot of it and it's going to take a while to lose. Then once you lose it, for some reason your skin refuses to reunite with the body, as if it's mad at you and your decision to live off chicken strips for the last 9 months. It's loose and stretchy and it sways and slaps you when you try and get on the treadmill to run it off. Oh, and your boobs... Lord, what did your boobs ever do to deserve such ill-treatment?  You can't shut it off.  No, not the baby... though God, wouldn't it be amazing if they had on/off switches? What's that? You're looking for the the CPS number again? Back to my point. 
You can't shut being a MOM off. In the old days, you could be all, ""Man, I'm tired and it's Saturday, I think I'll sleep all day,"" or ""Man, I'm in the mood to dance, and it's Saturday, I think I'll drink too much and make bad decisions."" But now you're a mom. It doesn't matter if it's Saturday or Christmas or your sister's wedding, you've got to take care of baby first. I'll give you another example. Last week, I attended an event with my very own baby daddy. It was super fancy, black tie, cocktails... I was sitting at a table next to SJP and Kate Hudson! I had on my Spanx, my hair was blown out and I managed to make it the whole night without falling off my six-inch heels. I dare say, to the outside viewer, I was downright fabulous. And then I got home and I put on my milk-stained t-shirt and my sweatpants and I got up three times with the baby during the night to feed him. Fabulous or not, when I come home, as far as he's concerned, I'm just mommy.
So here it is, new mom, the honest truth. Some days this ""job"" of being a mom is going to suck. But clearly, no one would do it -- and I certainly wouldn't have done it three times -- if all the really crappy parts weren't outweighed by all the amazing stuff. Just prep yourself in advance so you know that when you have those really bad days, you're not alone. While you're crying with your new baby, I'm somewhere in California, covered in spit-up crying right along with you.

I wish that same confidence for my other three children. I wish it for all of us.",2014-03-04,FAMILY,"Written by Nina Badzin for Brain, Child Magazine
My son, 7 at the time, froze at his first piano recital. I'm talking about the stuff of recurring nightmares some people would have for the rest of their lives froze.
It was the typical recital setup. Students sat in a row ranging from ages 7 to 18. One by one, they faced the audience, stated the name of the piece they had prepared, then sat at the piano and played. The room was full of proud parents and grandparents ready to burst into applause.
Sam was the fifth student in line. He played the first 40 seconds of the song with no problem while I proudly recorded his performance from the first row. Then, in the middle of his rock-and-roll version of ""Old MacDonald,"" his hands stopped. They didn't skip a note or simply pause for a second. They stopped. My muscles tensed as if preparing to get up and help. I knew it wasn't my place though. His teacher was in the chair nearby anyway. Surely she would do something.
The teacher didn't help. I looked at my husband. No, he whispered. This isn't your show. 
Sam started the song again, but froze at the same spot several more times. I put down my camera and glared at his teacher, though there was nothing she could do. This was Sam's performance, I tried convincing myself. Not hers. Not mine. This isn't my show, I repeated silently. This isn't my show.
OK, fine, if it wasn't my show, then why was I sweating so profusely you'd think I was the one sitting at the piano starting the same song for, yes, the sixth time now?
My parents were there. My husband's parents were there. I couldn't look at any of them because in my mind, I had failed. I didn't make him practice enough, I thought. In my attempts to let him take some ownership over the whole practicing process and not be the helicopter mom that I sometimes can be, I trusted Sam when he said he was prepared. I should have pushed him more, I thought. I should have been more than a helicopter, I should have been a 747.
I felt sick, like I might faint, as Sam started the song yet again. That's it, I thought. I will faint and take the attention away from Sam. It will be an act of heroism and motherly devotion that he will remember for the rest of his life. 
From her chair, Sam's teacher advised him to start again from the beginning. The beginning! What good was coming from starting at the beginning? Sure, she had been a piano teacher for three decades, but come on. My boy needed help. That I didn't sit next to Sam and put my fingers over his to play the right notes should go up there with the greatest examples of self-restraint in all of motherhood.
Sam eventually made it through the rest of the song, bowed, and took his seat. We, his parents and grandparents, were extraordinarily proud that he had not run straight out of the room like I imagined I would have done in his place. And of course that was the issue right there. Sam had shown all the strength and fortitude any parent could wish for a child in that moment. But I was too busy projecting how I would have felt sitting on that piano bench. I couldn't seem to separate myself from Sam -- I was Sam, Sam was me.
Unfortunately, the next 45 minutes of the recital were excruciating, even worse than the performance itself -- at least for me. Sam reclaimed his seat among his peers and stared ahead while other students took their turns. I was anxious to see Sam's eyes, but he wouldn't turn around. I wanted the warmth and love on my face to tell him that botching up the rock-and-roll version of ""Old MacDonald"" was OK. That his ability to stick with it until he got it right said more about his character than anything else possibly could. Why wouldn't that rascal let me do my job?
I'm not proud to admit that I distracted myself from worrying about how Sam might be feeling by hoping somebody else's child would make some kind of glaring mistake. I didn't want Sam to be the only kid with an imperfect performance, I thought at the time. But I know now I also didn't want to be the only mom with a child who had made a mistake. I was making the entire recital all about me.
""I messed up a little,"" Sam said when he found us afterwards.
""But you stuck with it,"" I reminded him. His grandparents said variations of the same thing. We all did the dance of trying to keep him from any shame and embarrassment. But Sam didn't need our worrying and protection. He didn't need our anxiety, our helicoptering, or our attempt to shield him from any discomfort. He certainly didn't need me to imagine how I would have felt if I were him. Because I was not him. And that was a good thing. Because my little boy was a self-possessed person who was taking responsibility for his recital. It was his show.
""Can we still go out for ice cream?"" he asked.
And off we went. I knew at that moment that the blessing of this botched piano recital was learning to have faith in my son and learning to have some faith in myself as a mother. I feel confident that given the chance, Sam will make it through many of life's songs, no matter how many do-overs and false starts he has to endure along the way. I wish that same confidence for my other three children. I wish it for all of us.

Read on and enjoy!
Dad’s there for support To misquote the Bard: When it comes to watching daughters grow up, some dads are born ready, some gradually achieve readiness -- and some just have extremely awkward situations thrust upon them. The third circumstance is obviously the most promising blog fodder.
In this vein, DadCentric blogger Kevin recounts a day of bra shopping with his “tweenage” daughter. The following quote should give you some idea of his general comfort level:
Lightly lined, seamless bandeau, structured bandeau, scoop, demi, ashton, push up, super push up -- who the hell buys their ""junior"" a super push up? -- extra padding, wings, no wings. I haven't been this overwhelmed by selection since the last time I shopped Home Depot for sheet metal screws.
Despite Dad's initial discombobulation, the shopping trip is a success (""the next morning, the sun still rose in the east""): daughter gets her bra, dad gets a great post.
Writing lessons from Rob Lowe
Katie Allison Granju admits that she has “never been a particularly huge Rob Lowe fan.”  But she also wants fellow bloggers to know that the actor’s “really well-written memoir,” “Stories I Only Tell My Friends,” is “an excellent case study in mom blogging done right.” Like “the very best mom bloggers,” Granju says, Lowe manages to preserve the privacy and dignity of all the people he describes –- including himself.
In Granju’s words: ""As you read [Lowe’s book], … [you may] THINK you got a great deal of dish, but in reality, you’ve come away with nothing inappropriately intimate or with too many highly specific details.""
Mommy bloggers who’ve tried to toe the line between familiarity and oversharing will appreciate that this isn’t easy -- but it’s ultimately rewarding for readers and writers alike.
Putting the ""Mommy Wars"" into perspective New York City mom Liz Gumbinner (a.k.a. Mom-101) is “wildly conflicted” about the large number of people she’s seen panhandling with babies on the city’s subway recently.
While Gotham subway-riders aren’t known for their magnanimity, Gumbinner’s first instinct is to help these people in any way she can. All the same, she can’t help wondering how the experience is affecting the babies in question -- among other things, she asks, “Is the panhandler helping or exploiting her baby?”
Hers are questions without obvious answers; each woman’s situation is likely unique. But no matter their backstories, Gumbinner says, these mothers put the “Mommy Wars” debates of recent weeks into a startling perspective:
I simply can’t imagine the agony of having no choice but to spend your days on the smelly subway with a newborn, hoping for some money for diapers or food. It gives me pause when you think how many women spent weeks (weeks!) debating whether a stupid magazine cover headline undermines our self-esteem.
Easy as 1-2-3-4-5? If you discovered a “magical” incantation that made your toddler obedient, what would you do? Marvel at the unlikelihood of the occurrence? Ask an expert whether your technique could possibly be as foolproof as it seemed? Blog about it?
Ilana Wiles of Mommy Shorts has done all three -- and her trick is as easy as 1-2-3-4-5. “Somehow these numbers can make my stubborn two-year-old do just about anything,” she writes –- in bold type, to underscore her incredulity.
The technique –- simply telling her daughter she’ll count to five, and then the task at hand (teeth-brushing, shoe-donning) needs to get done -– is simple and “totally instinctual.” Surprised at its success rate, Ilana asks her sister (“Dr. B,” who has a PhD in school psychology) to weigh in on the method’s relative effectiveness. Here’s just one of Dr. B’s insights on the subject:
The truth is that most children don’t need the countdown and will respond within 5 seconds if you make your request in close proximity, at eye level, and wait 5 seconds for the child to comply.
There’s a first time for everything -- again Here's a short but sweet reflection from Rebecca Woolf on why, mundane frustrations aside, parenting is worth it –- not least because it allows adults who have outgrown childhood’s myriad small joys to experience them again through their sons and daughters: “[Their firsts] are my firsts, too. Except this time, I get to watch and listen and see and learn and remember. But mostly, I get to learn.”

600,PARENTS,How Ferguson Schools Are Helping Their Students Deal With Trauma,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ferguson-school-counselors_n_5701062.html,,2014-08-22,FAMILY,"If students from the Ferguson-Florissant School District want to talk when they return to school on Monday, ample adult ears will be available to listen.
The start of school was delayed more than a week for students from the Missouri school district because of violent protests in the area after the fatal shooting of black teen Michael Brown. Brown, who was unarmed at the time of his death, was killed by a local police officer. The chaotic protests that followed highlighted racial tensions in the area. 
The district is taking extra precautions to make sure students receive help if they were troubled by Brown's death or the subsequent protests. While the school district normally employs 33 full-time counselors for its 11,000 students, it will be almost doubling the number of counselors for the start of school, according to district spokeswoman Jana Shortt. The district's staff also went through additional crisis training this week on how to help kids who are experiencing difficulty over the situation. 
""This is an extraordinary event and tragic and unforeseen circumstance, and so we have been focused on being ready to care for the needs of our students when they return to us,"" Shortt told The Huffington Post.
A local health services agency, Great Circle, is providing the district with additional counselors. Organizations such as the St. Louis County Children's Service Fund are helping to finance the effort. 
The additional counselors will be in district schools every day for the first week. Then, after evaluating district need, they will work with administrators to develop a long-term plan for services. 
""For the first week, we will be in their schools every day doing daily evaluations with schools,"" Angela Bratcher, clinical director of day treatment services for Great Circle, told The Huffington Post. ""A long-term plan depends what the kids are coming in with ... depends what we're seeing from the kids."" 
Shortt noted that some of the district's teachers have been ""out in the community doing volunteer work ... so they have a sense of some of what's out there. But certainly when we welcome kids back to school on Monday, we'll have a greater sense of where everybody is at."" 
The U.S. Department of Education has also pitched in to support Ferguson students. On Thursday, Education Secretary Arne Duncan told HuffPost that the department has been ""working with educators in Ferguson, doing everything we can to be supportive.""  ""This is a unique situation but sadly we have a lot of experience dealing with districts under tremendous stress or duress ... and we stay with these relationships for the long haul,"" said Duncan.
He also stressed the important role schools play in helping students deal with difficult situations. 
""Education leaders there help to lead the healing, help to lead that community to where it needs to go, which from the outside, seems to be a very different place,"" Duncan said. ""Education leaders there will be a huge part of the solution."" 
Districts in the area have taken different approaches to dealing with the local unrest. In Illinois' Edwardsville School District, which is about 25 miles away from Ferguson, teachers have been encouraged to ""change the subject and refocus the students"" if the topic of Michael Brown's death arises, reports the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 
District Superintendent Ed Hightower told the outlet that the situation in Ferguson should not be discussed in the classroom if it cannot be discussed in an objective way. 
""We all have personal opinions about what has gone wrong, what has gone right. And we all have opinions on what should be done,"" Hightower said. ""We don't need to voice those opinions or engage those opinions in the classrooms.""
But Bratcher said she wants school to be a safe place for students to talk about their feelings.
""Their opinions are not right or wrong. We're just giving them a safe way to talk about it,"" said Bratcher. ""When you can't express your feelings, you might deal with them in unhealthy ways.""

We couldn't do anything but start screwing them up from day one.  So, when we see characteristics in our kids that are reflections of our best selves, it's a big check in the win column.",2014-08-12,FAMILY,"Kids: They're Just Like Us!
I'm not quite sure what wins out in the battle of nature vs. nurture but, one way or the other, kids are a product of their parents. They look like us, talk like us and they share many of our little quirks. My wife Allie and I have many things in common, but we're also a bit of an opposites attract kind of couple. So there are certain behavioral characteristics we see in our kids that are a clear reflection of one, or the other, of us. And that's when we find it fun and amusing to play: the Blame Game! The rules are simple, when we observe a familiar characteristic in one of our kids we either lay ""blame"" or take ""credit.""
   It's finger pointing time! 
Rules of the Game
This ""game"" could, of course, go horribly wrong and be used to passive-aggressively point out the other's shortcomings. There are some (until now) unwritten safeguards. First, it helps that my wife and I love each other very much and that we think our kids are funny and awesome. Second, we play at the right time. If we're in one of those patches, common in most marriages, when we're kind of getting on each other's nerves or are not quite seeing eye-to-eye, we do not play the Blame Game. This is a silly little distraction, not a match to the death. Third, we don't reveal anything ""new"" or that we've been holding back. Allie and I have been together for fifteen years; we're both well aware of the individual idiosyncrasies that annoy the crap out of the other person. If there is some new troublesome habit, the Blame Game is not the right venue to bring it up.
Let the Games Begin
One of my many flaws that tick Allie off is that I become completely deaf and unresponsive when I watch TV or work -- OK, play -- on the computer. The fact that our daughter Penny is the same way serves as my comeuppance. It is really goddamn annoying! In fact, it bothers me more than Allie. I guess because she's used to dealing with it. Plus, I know it's a terrible attribute and I don't want my kids to inherit the things that suck about me.
Allie knows that I would love if her culinary tastes were more diverse. She's not just a picky eater, she's a world class pain in the a** when it comes to food. But Penny makes her look like a gourmand. With enough prodding, bribes and threats, Penny will try small bites of new foods, but it's always with a ""yuck, I don't like that."" The girl won't eat chicken nuggets... chicken friggin' nuggets! And she gets way too excited when the item she did enjoy is some kind of new cookie. She seems to subsist entirely on yogurt, string cheese, pb&j, pancakes, apples and treats. Even if it is nature not nurture, Allie gets the blame on that one. Simon eats everything. That's my kid.
 Now there's a kid excited about his green beans.
Except when he's not. Like in the morning; he wakes up chirping, with a smile on his face. I wake up still asleep. Penny knows to tread lightly before I've had at least one cup of coffee. She's going to be a coffee drinker, too. She is not a morning person.
Most of the various characteristics we point out in the Blame Game are actually behaviors we find endearing, or at least charming, in the other person. Allie is adorably clutzy. So is Penny. I'm somewhat cavalier with my own safety; Allie might use the term reckless. She calls me an idiot, but I think she likes it (at least a little). Unfortunately, Penny lacks both grace and the good sense not to do crazy a** sh*t. It is not a good combination, though it can be fun to watch. She actually tends to get hurt more often just walking from Point A to Point B than she does jumping from Point A, over Point B, rolling under Point C and somehow landing at Point D. I've pointed out to Allie that she never gets injured pretending to run a Spartan Race; her knees are all scraped up from that less than treacherous jaunt to the kitchen for yet another yogurt drink.
 Balance & grace (as long as she's doing something mom would not approve of). 
Game Logic
I think we play the Blame Game because we want our kids to be the best they can be. When they were born, they were all potential. We couldn't do anything but start screwing them up from day one. So, when we see characteristics in our kids that are reflections of our best selves, it's a big check in the win column. When we see things in our kids that are less than ideal imitations of ourselves... it's kind of what we expected. But it's also an opportunity to do better, for them and for us. It's hard to change bad habits, but kids provide powerful motivation. These days, when Allie asks me something while I'm zoned out in front of the tube, I try to snap out of it long enough to mute or pause my show and ask her to repeat what she said. It's not perfect, but it's an improvement. And hopefully, Penny and Simon subconsciously take note.
It's fun to watch your children's personalities take shape. Right now, Allie and I are far and away the biggest influences in our kids' lives, so it's easy and amusing to pick out their attributes that remind us of each other. Soon enough though, they'll be inundated with influences ranging from friends to television to, well, each other. There are already things they do that make us wonder, ""where did that come from?"" Penny has her own circa-early-'90s-era sitcom catchphrase, where she puts her hands on her hips, speaks into a camera only she can see, and exclaims, ""Holy shockamole, I sure am a handful!"" Seriously, where did that come from?
As parents, we know (though we don't always like to admit it) our kids are going to keep growing and changing and becoming less and less like ""us"" and more like ""themselves."" Sigh. But as cute as they are as babies and toddlers, they become so much more interesting as they get older. Even at 4, I love the conversations I have with Penny. She makes connections and draws conclusions and has her own personal preferences that have nothing to do with Allie or me. She and Simon are full of surprises and the real joy of the Blame Game is taking note of the funny little things they do on a daily basis, wherever those things may come from.

From the day she was born in 1997 until three days before she died in 2004.,2015-04-02,FAMILY,"I finally did today something that I have wanted to do but avoided for over 10 years. Today, I found the strength and the time to go through and label photographic negatives (remember them?) from 1995 through 2004. I've been afraid to do this, as the project requires reviewing the timeline of my life as a young wife and new mother in kodachrome. 1995-2004 was the sweet spot for our family.

By odd coincidence, Charlotte died in August of 2004. For several months, I could barely function, let alone chronicle the events of the day, so it was not until early 2005 that I started keeping track of our family life with a camera. By then, we had gone digital. Charlotte's entire life is represented in the negatives that I sorted today. From the day she was born in 1997 until three days before she died in 2004. Writing about it now, I feel the knot in my gut growing. But this morning, as I worked on the project, I was methodical and somewhat disengaged as I worked through the piles.
The six-inch tall stack of sheets of negatives tells the story of our young family. It tells the story of BEFORE.

Reviewing the negatives, I feared, might take me to the bottom of the grief abyss again. It's harrowing climbing out of that deep hole and forging a new life after staggering loss. It's mighty hard work to weave together the fullness of the experience of what life was like before with what life was like after and find some way to feel any sense of comfort or sense of acceptance about it. And yet I MUST. We all MUST. And I waited and avoided and made excuses. I even had the courage to write a book and share it with the world over these past 10 years, but still, I waited on the negatives. 
I was afraid of them. But today, I did it. I did it.
Sitting here quietly and scanning the piles before me, I am aware of my feet on the ground, my heart beating quietly in my chest and the breath moving through me with ease. I feel a sense of completion and relief to be sending them off to be digitized. The effort will be worthwhile. Our family records will now include a full history in pictures. Charlotte's older brother and younger sister will have free access to the full archive of our family life and their childhood. I did it for them, but I also now know I did it for me.
I'm looking forward to scrolling through the memories when the negatives come back to me as jpgs on discs. I'll savor them. I know I'll weep, but I'm also looking forward to that deep dive back into the outtakes of photos not used in albums, but still worthy of keeping. Photos of painted faces on Halloween, birthday parties, family trips and sports activities. I'm so glad that we have them, so proud to have found a way to finally complete the project, and so relieved that I didn't fall into the abyss as I did the work today.

Boy, did you let your son have it. I was mortified. It's just so embarrassing when our kids misbehave in public. Your child was clearly out of control. He was melting down because you wouldn't give him a toy. But did you have to get up and throw the donuts in the trash? I mean he's just a kid who was pushing your buttons. Aren't you supposed to be the adult here?
I could hear him wining and crying for that toy. It was really annoying as my husband, myself and two sons were trying to enjoy a Sunday morning outing at breakfast time, something I did with my own parents as a child. Those were great memories.
Until you came in with your son.
All you did is yell at him. It was so sad. I felt so bad for him.
Where you there for a father/son date? Or were you just trying to get out of the house? Maybe you just picked him up from your ex wives house? Who knows! Maybe it was a family tradition, like mine.
But you were not having a good time, that's for sure.
My heart sank as I watched you hit your final straw and get up and toss all the donuts in the trash and walk out the door. Your son trailed behind you, crying even louder now.
I thought, ""Thank God that's not my son, he would never behave like that.""
And now, a year later, the same exact thing is happening to me. My son is having meltdowns over toys and donuts. Yesterday he yelled at me, ""Your fired!""
He thrashes about and yells and screams, ""your a bad mommy!"" He pushes my buttons to the limit and I sometimes snap. I scream back at him. I'm fighting with a five year old. I threaten to throw away his toys all while knowing that this doesn't work. Sometimes I reach my limit. Then I sit in the car and cry.
So believe me, now I understand that bewildered parent who is hanging by a thread. Back then I felt sorry for your child. Now I feel sorry for you. What changed?
Parenting is hard.
It happened to me. Experience.

605,PARENTS,Parents Combat Gender Stereotypes With Futuristic Kids' Clothing Line,Caroline Bologna,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baby-teith-clothing-line_n_7485416.html,,2015-06-02,FAMILY,"Designer Tiffe Fermaint and her fiancé Keith Walker hope that their kids' clothing line will provide a cool alternative to the countless children's brands that promote harmful gender stereotypes.
Inspired by the birth of their daughter Violet, Fermaint and Walker launched Baby Teith in 2013. Fermaint told The Huffington Post that she searched in vain for clothing that was gender neutral and eco-friendly, made from organic cotton. ""I was tired of seeing nothing but pink body suits with the word 'princess' blinged out in rhinestones in the girls' department,"" she said, adding, ""There's nothing wrong with that, it's just not my style.""
Seeking options for her daughter, the mom used her experience in fashion as a designer and visual stylist to create her own clothing line. Baby Teith was a hit with Fermaint's friends, and after many requests, she opened an Etsy shop to sell her designs to other parents. The designer and her fiancé eventually both quit their jobs to focus on Baby Teith full time. 

The mom describes her children's clothes as ""fun, comfortable and memorable"" and says she hopes her vivid, futuristic prints inspire their little wearers' imaginations. From moon and nebula images to a design inspired by VHS tape glitches, each print is truly unique. 
""Our newest collection for fall available through our Kickstarter Project is called Medieval Time Traveler,"" Fermaints said. ""It is inspired by the courage of Joan of Arc is meant to empower children.""
Last month, Fermaint and Walker launched a Kickstarter campaign to help fund the brand's production through an ethical manufacturer and bring Baby Teith to a major trade show.

The couple hopes the message behind their designs reaches the mainstream kids' clothing world. ""We genuinely believe that in this day and age, gender stereotypes are outdated,"" Fermaint told HuffPost. ""We want our daughter to form her own opinions on the subject and feel that she can dress any way she wishes.""
""Instilling this notion before she forms opinions like 'Pink is just for girls and I have to wear pink because I am a girl' can be an important step,"" she continued. ""We are extremely happy to see more clothing in the market that are gender neutral. The market is changing and we hope that bigger brands take notice. This is a huge step for gender equality.""
The Baby Teith Kickstarter campaign ends on June 6, and so far, they've raised almost 70 percent of their $10,000 goal. The brand also won the Phoenix New Times newspaper's 2014 award for ""Best Kids Clothing.""
As for their very first customer, Fermaint says her daughter really enjoys Baby Teith clothes. ""She may not be able to articulate how much she loves the garments yet, but we like to assume they are her favorite.""

608,PARENTS,Mom Receives Honorary Degree After Helping Quadriplegic Son Graduate,Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mom-receives-honorary-degree_us_592430a5e4b094cdba578921,"""As a mom, you just want to help your kids get through things. I’ve always believed in him,"" she said.",2017-05-23,FAMILY,"A mother who spent the last two years helping her son get his MBA after a fall left him a quadriplegic was recognized for her incredible work on Saturday in one of the most touching ways.
Judy O’Connor, who took notes and attended classes with her 29-year-old son, Marty O’Connor, received an honorary degree during a graduation ceremony at Chapman University in Orange, California. It came just moments after helping her son receive his degree on stage.
“Mrs. Judith O’Connor has attended all the classes with her son Marty,” the announcer, who appeared to choke up, told the crowd. “She has taken notes and worked with Marty throughout his academic career.”
Marty O’Connor told HuffPost that he nominated his mother as a way to honor all the help she had given him.
“It is impossible to not notice that kind of effort and dedication that she was showing in helping me prepare,” he said in an email, crediting his mother’s efforts as a driving force for his own academic successes and recognitions.
Judy O’Connor later told KTLA she was “totally blown away” to be pulled to the front of the stage. “I was trying to stay in the background,” she said. “As a mom, you just want to help your kids get through things. I’ve always believed in him and I knew he could do it and I just wanted to have his back.”
Nearly five years earlier, Marty O’Connor was working as a traveling salesman with a degree from the University of Colorado when he suffered a life-changing fall down a flight of stairs, he told the university in an interview.
“After I got hurt, I didn’t know which end was up,” he told the school. “I didn’t really have a direction. I was just dedicating myself to physical therapy five days a week.”
“While my body was in a better place because of that, mentally, I was just kind of lost. … I needed that mental challenge and wanted to add some professional value to myself,” he said.
At the time of his injury, his mother was working as a teacher in Florida. Knowing that her son was in such a difficult place “was killing me,” she told KTLA. “I couldn’t have my own child needing me, doing a job at the same time.”
She moved across the country to help her son, who began exploring MBA programs, leading to a scholarship opportunity.
In the beginning, he admitted, it was quite a daunting challenge.
“I didn’t know how going back to school without being able to write, or use my hands, or raise my hand in class, any of that, would go,” he told the school. “This has really forced upon me some patience and thoughtfulness in everything I’m doing. And I’m now doing better in school than I have in my entire life.” 
And Marty O’Connor has some great advice for others facing such physical challenges. “Your circumstances are not your sentence,” he told HuffPost.
“Living with a Spinal Cord Injury may limit your body, but it does not limit your mind. Embrace these challenges as an opportunity for growth in your life. I believe that sometimes God lays on our backs so that we are forced to look up,” he added. “The past few years have taught me so much about myself and have allowed me to develop new strengths that I can use to propel myself as an individual, a professional, and in service to the community.”
And he shared a quote from the ancient Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle to stress his point: “Where the needs of the world and your talents cross, there lies your vocation.”
As for what the future holds, Marty O’Connor said he plans to work for a sports startup company called DIVERTcity, where he’ll work to raise corporate sponsorship money. And he’ll continue to oversee his nonprofit organization, the Marty O’Connor Foundation for Progress, which aims to support people with debilitating injuries.
His mom plans to take some well-deserved time off and rest, as her son is aided by a professional assistant, the school said.

I have a perfect husband who is likewise, a perfect father. We have a perfect marriage. So naturally, we have perfect children and a perfect family. Before you pass a quick judgement on me, let me explain further.",2014-11-19,FAMILY,"So many of us strive for perfection. I believe for many of us, it's an innate desire within us, whether we'd like to admit to it or not. After all, we are made in His image. As contradictory as it may sound, God's power is certainly made perfect within our weaknesses. 
I am proud to say that I am the perfect mother. I have a perfect husband who is likewise, a perfect father. We have a perfect marriage. So naturally, we have perfect children and a perfect family. 
Before you pass a quick judgement on me, let me explain further. 
Perfect can be defined as having all the required or desirable elements, qualities or characteristics; as good as it is possible to be. Absolute; complete.
Why am I a perfect mother? I'm perfect because in the six years that I have been blessed to hold this title, I have failed again, and again, and again. I have made more mistakes that I can possibly total to this day. I have been irritable and impatient due to exhaustion and weariness. I have seen sides of myself that need so much correction, that leave me feeling humbled at the numerous situations I have found myself in. 
But with that said, as many times as I have failed, I have gotten right back up. I have dusted myself off, looked myself in the mirror and prayed to God that each of those falls made me a better mother. I have turned my life, my heart, my complete existence over to the constant thought of each and every decision I make and its effect on my children, our family. I never knew I was capable of the immense love I could hold until the day they placed my daughter on my chest. It was possibly the most overwhelming moment of my lifetime. Right then and there, I was forever changed. 
I know that despite the number of mistakes I've made and the mistakes I'm bound to make in the future, my love as a mother is perfect. My love for my children isn't capable of ever faltering or, for that matter, ever diminishing. My love for my children is never-ending and has no flaws to be found within it. A mother's love for her children, without argument, is perfect. 

Why is my husband a perfect father? He changes diapers. He does the dishes. He gives the babies their baths. He brushes teeth and combs hair. He dresses kids in the morning and gets their jammies on them in the evening. He ties and reties shoelaces. He cooks meals. He rubs heads to sleep. He sleeps on hardwood floors beside toddler beds just in case the scary monster comes back. He watches Dora, The Bubble Guppies and Team Umizoomi more times than any adult should. Basically, when he is not at work, he is in Daddy mode. 24 hours a day, 365 days a year (ok, maybe for the exception of NFL Draft Day and Sundays during football season).
Should he do a lot of those things? Sure. Does he want to do a lot of those things, day in and day out, even when he's sick or sleep deprived? No. But... he does them anyway. And the majority of the time, he does them without complaint. He gives his family everything he can, but mainly he gives us himself. 
My husband would walk across fire to the ends of the earth for our children, without hesitation. Yes, he is the perfect father. 
Why is my marriage perfect? Our marriage has been put to the test more times than I can say I would have liked. And I am no fool to believe that it's not done being tested. Throughout these tests, there have been numerous times it would have been easier to give up, to give in and well, call it a day. There has been hundreds of times in the past decade that my husband and I have pulled ourselves out of ruts so deep, it was hard to even imagine a light at the end of the tunnel. We've fought hard but thankfully, we've loved even harder. Most days I drive him absolutely nuts and he can agitate me like no other, but I can't picture a day without him beginning it or a night without him ending it. 
It may possibly be one of the most comforting feelings in this world to know he loves me completely, flaws and all. He loves me as much as he knows how to love. And for that, I very well may be one of the luckiest women on this planet. 

Yes, our marriage is perfect because our love has outlasted and overcome what the world says it shouldn't and very well couldn't. Our love for one another is indeed perfect. 
Why are our children perfect? My children fight (OK, they battle one another), they throw temper-tantrums, they complain about some things that they shouldn't and every day they need more than one (or two) gentle reminders on things they should have handled correctly the first time. However, their resiliency and innocent love is captivating. Their sincere empathy, in my opinion, is why this world is still here, still continuing on. I'm not sure at what point in our childhood, teens or adulthood that we lose that kind of love, forgiveness, endurance and ultimately, childlike faith. 
My children... they're human. They make mistakes. But... yes, they are their own perfection. When I look into each of their eyes, I could get lost in their ultimate love and endless wonder that I pray to God every day they never lose. I encourage my son and daughters to be big dreamers. To think the impossible. To go after the impossible. I know that if I teach them to believe enough in themselves and never lose that, they will be able to accomplish anything in this world. 

And lastly, why is our family perfect? I have thanked and praised God everyday that He had our plan, our perfect plan, laid out so carefully, so divinely, that no matter what this world has thrown at us or will continue to battle our family with, we will stand strong. We will stand together, and not if, but when we are brought to our knees again, we will turn and wait patiently for once again, the One who has turned each and every hardship and battle into a magnificent blessing.
So, as you can see, your definition of perfect and my definition of perfect may slightly differ. I have such a gratified feeling that I have found my perfection that I have prayed for since I was a little girl. I'm grateful that each day as I slip and make my mistakes, I'm reminded in some fashion of who I want to be, what I want to create and what my purpose is while on this earth. 
Find your perfect. Strive for your perfection. Will I ever reach the world's standards of perfection as a mother and wife? No. Will my husband ever reach the world's standards for perfection as a father or husband? Nope. Will our marriage and family and children meet those worldly standards for perfection? It's safe to say ""no.""
But I can say one thing: I wouldn't trade our perfect for any other perfect in this life.

611,PARENTS,Stop Telling Me I Am Ruining My Kids,"Elisha Wilson Beach, ContributorStay-at-home mom of 4 kids and 4 step-""adults"". Yes, you read ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stop-telling-me-i-am-ruining-my-kids_us_595299a6e4b0326c0a8d0bb6,"Lately, I have been feeling like every time that I log on to my computer, there’s some new article stating how yet another",2017-06-27,FAMILY,"Lately, I have been feeling like every time that I log on to my computer, there’s some new article stating how yet another parenting method is absolutely going to ruin my children. Just one click of a button and I am bombarded with title after title telling me I am causing brain damage, making my kids antisocial, creating high levels of anxiety, giving them diabetes, raising them to be completely incapable adults… the list goes on and on. But all the hysteria isn’t serving anyone. I realize media uses extreme tactics to capture our ever so short attention spans but this approach is starting to become more panic inducing than it is informative or helpful.
Just in every day conversations with other parents, I notice there is a level of paranoia that causes parents including myself to constantly question and re-question the parenting choices we make. It seems everything is beginning to become an either/or choice and there is no longer a gray area… Let your kid cry-it-out and your child will have permanent brain damage or hold them and they will never learn to self soothe. Either only feed your kid organic, local, gluten free everything or they will develop add, developmental delays and diabetes. Give “time-outs” and they will feel abandoned or give “time-ins” and they will become dependent on you to regulate their emotions. Sign them up for too many activities and they will suffer from anxiety or don’t sign them up for anything and they will have little to no self-esteem. You must NEVER say no, you must give ONLY positive feedback and ABSOLUTELY NO yelling ever… Can this stop?!?! I don’t know about you but it gets to the point where it scares me out of my ability to make parenting decisions.
The truth is, every family is different, every parent is different and every kid is different. There is no one method that works for everyone, not even in the same family. What works for my daughter doesn’t work for my son, so surely what works for my family may not work for yours. So what is up with the absolute parenting advice? Why does it have to be so black and white? Where is the gray area? The thing that makes parenting so hard is that it is never just black and white. It’s almost always about trying to figure out how to navigate the gray area. As a parent, I make a myriad of decisions every single day and I am guaranteed to make the wrong decision at some point but that doesn’t mean I have permanently damaged my kids.
Don’t get me wrong; I am a big advocate for parents educating themselves. Read books and articles, take parenting classes and start parenting groups. I know I need as much help as I can get because like the saying goes, “when you know better, you do better.” The truth is parenthood is anxiety inducing enough all on it’s own so extremist views, scare tactics and parent shaming are not helpful to anyone. Parenting advice should be just that and not an accusatory judge and jury that sentences me to a life of parenting failure.
At the end of the day, none of us are purposely trying to ruin our kids. I know I have my kid’s best interest at heart and I am sure you do too. I am human. I make mistakes, learn from them, grow from them and move on and I believe seeing me do that helps my kids learn and grow. So my advice to you and myself is go ahead and read those articles, take it in and do with it as you see fit. Know that you will drop the ball some times but trust that you are not permanently ruining your kids.

Francisco Pérez, known to his friends as Paco, posed for some parody pregnancy photos on the outskirts of Málaga City in southern Spain.
The series was the brainchild of photographer Martyn Wilkes. 
“I had been recently doing lots of maternity work, and I wanted to do something different to break things up and have a bit of fun,” Wilkes told The Huffington Post. “I have known Paco for four or five years and admittedly often jested about his rather large stomach, which resembled a pregnant mother.”
The photographer came up with the outfit, painted stomach concept and flower accessories. He said his subject found the photo shoot hilarious and totally nailed the execution.
Both men are fathers, as Wilkes has a 5-year-old girl and 13-month-old boy, and Pérez has two daughters, 22-year-old Natalia and 26-year-old Virginia. 
A story involving Natalia influenced Pérez’ decision to participate in the photo shoot and to write “Noelia” on his stomach.
After their second child was born, his wife sent him to officially register her name, Noelia. But Pérez had a few too beers along the way and his drunken scribble was misread as Natalia.
The dad decided to use this photo shoot to help make up for his mistake all those years ago and give his wife a Noelia. Fittingly, Wilkes compensated Pérez for his time with beer. 
Although the shoot took place a year ago, the photos are still spreading giggles across the internet. Wilkes hoped the project would create good publicity for his work, but he ultimately had one goal.
“The main thing I was looking for was to make people laugh,” the photographer said. 
Mission accomplished.

Showers, exercise, and",2017-02-26,FAMILY,"During those first months after having a newborn, your one and only goal is to keep the child alive. Showers, exercise, and sex are all a very distant thing of the past. But once you finally get to the end of that sleep-deprived tunnel, the light shining in also brings with it the inevitable motherhood emotion ― dun, dun, dun ― guilt.
You are only months into this damn thing and it has already arrived! Although your brain has completely turned into mush and your biggest concern has now become whether your child should keep chewing on their ‘moldy’ Sophie toy, somehow guilt still has a way of taking over it all. You begin to start worrying about the future and getting anxious about the unknown.
Your racing thoughts are as follows:
Your Body ― Will it ever be the same? Ugh, is belly skin supposed to feel this flappy and leathery? God I really need to start working out, all those other moms are so much smaller than me. I’ll start Monday. Okay, next Monday…
Your Partner ― I know the doctor said six weeks, but maybe I misunderstood her. I think she meant six months… Is it really necessary to have anything enter this area ever again? Does is hurt this much for everyone? I think I’ll need a whole bottle of wine next time…
Your Career ― What the hell am I doing with my life? If I take some time off will I ever be able to get a job again? Wait ― come again ― daycare costs how much? Is it even worth going back to work? But today, I actually think I’m looking forward to getting out of the house and going back to work. Does that make me a bad mom?
How to deal with these thoughts: 
Your body ― You gave birth to a human. A living, breathing, tiny person. Give yourself a break, six packs went out in the 90’s anyways (or so I tell myself). Those early months are devoted entirely to the babe, but it’s also important not to neglect yourself. It’s a slippery slope because if we continue to give our all to everyone else but ourselves, it makes for one depleted mama.
Getting to the gym might feel impossible, so try popping in a short DVD at home, or go on some stroller walks a couple times a week. You can bond with the baby and burn some calories at the same time. But more than anything, just be kind. Don’t beat yourself up. Put forth the energy toward your body image that you would want to model for your children from the start.
Your Partner ― Yes, you have a new relationship you are forming with the little one, but it’s also extremely important not to neglect the one responsible for having them in the first place! Those early months require so much teamwork and patience as a couple but when the doctor gives you the go ahead, it’s important to get ‘back on the horse’ per say.
I loved this PSA for the Do Your Part(ner) Campaign by Plum Organics. It completely nails how important intimacy is for couples after kids. So even though you may still be sleep deprived or body conscious, power down those phones, pour some wine, and carve out some much needed time for the two of you.
Your Career ― The hardest thing to wrap your head around at the beginning is that you can’t have it all. You are no longer responsible for just yourself anymore and something has to give. It’s tough trying to navigate how your old job fits into your new life or trusting someone else to take care of the child. It’s tough to leave that job behind and it’s also tough to leave the babe behind. All are hard decisions because they are all selfless decisions.
So, to those stay-at-home moms who feel like they are stuck in a jail cell with an even crazier inmate (a teething baby), please know that there is fellow mom at work getting pictures sent from the nanny who is beating herself up for not being able to be in that same prison. We all want what we can’t have, but by spending time wishing our current situations away, we are missing out on the precious gift of the present.
How to change these thoughts: 
Know that you are enough, simply because you are trying. And more importantly, know that you are not alone. Guess what? Despite what social media may display, no one knows what the hell they are doing either. Everyone struggles, even though they may not show it. We are all just winging it together.
So when you feel that loss of control or anxiousness coming on, try your best to switch that guilty thought out for a grateful one instead. Do this each day until it becomes habit over time.
In the end, our occupations all read ‘Mom.’ The less judgmental and more candid and supportive we are of each other, the more an identity crisis can be averted.

Are you the parent of a little one who can't possibly experience the dangers of texting and sexting since she doesn't own a cell phone yet? If you are the kind of adult who cares enough about kids and their safety to be reading this article, you instantly know that both questions are rhetorical. In today's world, with apps designed for infants and laptops marketed to preschoolers, we know that we need to prepare even our youngest kids to live safely online. What follows is an all-too-common account of innocence turned ugly for a group of under-informed digital dwellers:
Six fourth-grade classmates were together at Gigi's house for her 10th birthday sleepover party. They began their night as many party-goers do -- eating pizza, watching movies, opening presents and loading up on sweets. Gigi's parents were both actively involved in all of the activities -- helping the girls make dinner, painting nails, chit-chatting and re-arranging furniture in the basement to make room for six sleeping bags, six pillows and about three dozen stuffed animals. When the lights went out at 11 pm, the scene looked like childhood personified.When Gigi's parents went to bed, however, adolescence washed over the girls like a storm. Spearheaded by Hailey, a girl whose older siblings helped her become more ""advanced"" than the rest, conversations quickly moved into boys, then liking boys, then kissing boys, then taking photos at the sleepover to show to boys. At one point, Hailey had the idea of trying on a pair of extremely short shorts. Another girl suggested she try them on without underwear. Then, a third girl took a photo on her cell phone of Hailey modeling the shorts.Exhausted by their own silliness, the girls eventually fell asleep. In the morning, they ate pancakes and bacon, hugged their stuffed animals and acted like 10-year-olds again. They went back to school as best friends and talked about that sleepover fondly for the rest of the year.Four years later, as 8th graders, their friendships had changed. The six girls were no longer a tight-knit group. Hailey, whose mature ways were admired when the girls were 10, was now the subject of one of middle-school's worst forms of verbal bullying: slut-shaming. Friends and frenemies alike joined forces to humiliate her publicly. This went on for months, and school had become almost unbearable for her. Hailey thought things had gotten as bad as they could get -- until they got worse. One day, a photo was posted on Hailey's Instagram page, with the caption, ""Whoring around since the fourth grade."" Hailey didn't recognize the photo at first. She was hurt and confused as kids from all across her middle school seemed to know about it. She was in full-fledged denial that the photo was even real, until one of her fellow sleepover party-goers laughed and asked, ""Remember that night at Gigi's? We all had so much fun!""
Indeed, that night in 4th grade did start off with childlike fun. Even when the topics started to veer off-color into boys and bras, there was still an innocence to it. The addition of technology to the mix, however, instantly changed that sleepover from a night young girls could remember fondly to an evening that Hailey would forever regret. Did the cell phone camera cause the cruelty? No. The picture-taker's intentions at the time were pure. Did the use of technology create an unanticipated, long-term risk for the girls? Absolutely!
Be assured: it was not just Hailey who was put at-risk. Although it was she who bore the brunt of intense ridicule when the photo was shared online, the girl who posted it also put herself in legal jeopardy. Having and posting photos of underage girls' private parts is a crime. In one impulsively cruel click of a mouse, a 14-year old girl who thought she was ""just kidding around"" found herself in serious trouble. The situation ended badly for all.
Could those girls have anticipated all of the trouble that was to come?
At nine and ten years of age, most kids are very aware of technology but still quite naïve about all of the hurtful ways in which it can be used. Well into their adolescence even, many kids remain oblivious to the legal consequences of their online actions. One of the most important things that adults can do to bring an end to cyberbullying is to teach kids about the risks of their online behavior and to give them skills to protect themselves from lasting harm. This kind of education should begin as soon as kids start using technology or spending time with others who do. Bear in mind that Hailey did not own a cell phone -- she merely attended a party with a friend who did. In this world, it is almost certain that waiting to talk about technology until kids have their own email addresses, smartphones, social media profiles and Facebook accounts is waiting way too long.

An entire year's worth of small moments missed because I kept putting them off for another day.,2015-01-05,FAMILY,"I was cleaning out my junk drawer, a thankless task that always reveals the less flattering aspects of my life I'd rather keep hidden. Projects neglected. Maintenance forgotten. Guilty pleasures stashed away. 
This time was no different. The first one I pulled out I didn't think too much about. Then there was another. And another. And another. AND another.
Five little bubble containers. There were five of the little bottles given out at birthday parties and stashed in holiday gift bags. There was a little red one topped with a snowman. There was a little yellow one with an Easter egg stamped in to the plastic. A turquoise one. A blue one. A green one. 
Every one of them was taken from pleading little hands and stashed away. ""It will make too big of a mess,"" I'd say as Griffin begged to be allowed to blow bubbles. ""You'll just spill it everywhere,"" my frowning reply. How many times had I stopped him as he tried to open the container? How many times had I talked him out of one of the easiest and purest of childhood joys?
I'd put them in the junk drawer with the intention of pulling them all out when it was time to blow bubbles. But when is it really time to blow bubbles? Never in my life have I penciled in ""blow bubbles"" on to my weekly schedule. ""Blow bubbles"" never makes a to-do list or an activities calendar -- at least not mine. Even when I create time in our schedule for ""play,"" it's the flashy activities of the season that get all the attention. We build a snowman. We run in the sprinklers. We fly a kite. 
Meanwhile, the bubbles were forgotten. An entire year's worth of small moments missed because I kept putting them off for another day. 
Well, not this year. 
This year, I resolve to blow more bubbles. 
These amazing little creatures that inhabit my life are so like bubbles themselves. Beautiful and slightly magical. A little messy. And oh-so-very temporary. Already I can feel them leaving me. Griffin will be in five-day-a-week preschool next year and then it's just a hop, skip, and a jump to kindergarten. Pop! Amos leaves behind another symbol of babyhood every day. Pop! Pop! Pop!
So, while they are still here, while they are still little, I'm going to soak it all up. It is so easy to get busy and forget that my children aren't just passengers as I run errands and complete projects. Often, I tell myself they are the reason I try so hard. I want to make money to buy them the things they need. I want to create a house they love being in. I want to be a person they can admire. And as important as all that is, they are not only a source of must-do's in my life. They are also the source of joy. But joy doesn't just come from scheduled activities. In my experience, I feel it most profoundly when I stop to enjoy those everyday moments that come and go so quickly. 
Like blowing bubbles in the middle of breakfast or on the way to the mailbox or while we're waiting for Daddy to get home.
Plus, bubbles make those moments so very easy. I don't know why, for so long, I saw blowing bubbles as a messy chore. There is no prep. There are no special outfits. The thin film of soap left behind just makes my next cleanup that much easier. I only have to pull out one of these tiny little containers and watch Amos's eyes fill with glee as Griffin giggles and smiles. 
And I try to soak it all up before these moments are gone.
Pop!

Josh Gaines, known online as Josh Darnit, is back with another “Exact Instructions Challenge” with his family. This time, he asked them to teach him how to make ramen.
The funny dad tried to follow his kids’ steps, but ended up getting dry noodles everywhere and pouring hot water directly on the ramen package. Needless to say, the kids were frustrated.
Gaines told HuffPost the noodles came from fans who sent the family snacks after watching their last exact instructions challenge video. 
“They sent us dried almond fish, hard boiled quail eggs, dehydrated squid, seaweed, plus the noodles they wanted us to do an exact instructions challenge with,” he said.
Despite driving his kids bananas, Gaines was a good sport. After his daughter offered some decent instructions on making the noodles, they still were crunchy and the seasoning wasn’t spread throughout, but Gaines ate them anyway.

In their efforts to cure what they see as a moral crisis infecting our nation, the anti-choice movement has historically thrown their power, money, and influence behind their two favorite antidotes to abortion: abstinence-only education and adoption. In any era when reproductive rights are being rolled back, as they are now, feminists need to get stronger and clearer about where we stand and what we’re fighting for. We all know, both from data and from common sense, that abstinence education is not only a failure but wildly detrimental to the health and safety of young people. But there doesn’t yet seem to be a broader understanding, even in the mainstream feminist and pro-choice movements, that promoting adoption has its problems too.
Mainstream feminism ― feminism by and for middle and upper-middle-class white women ― has historically gotten behind adoption. Feminists have supported the rights of single people and same-gendered families to adopt, the rights of adoptive families in contested adoptions, and policies intended to get children into adoptive homes faster. What’s missing from mainstream feminism is any explicit support for families of origin: the parents who have to lose their children, the families that must be dismantled in order for adoptive families to be built.
When I was growing up, my parents always told me how brave and smart my birth mother was. How she loved me so much that she made the selfless choice to give me up because she wanted me to have a better life ― because as an unwed 17-year-old, a high school senior, she knew she couldn’t be a good parent to me. She had made this choice, they said, selflessly and graciously, with the support of everyone around her, so that I could have the life I truly deserved. My parents did not invent this language, of course; it was given to them by adoption professionals, adoption books, and support groups, and they repeated it, lovingly, insistently, until we all believed it was true. Like so many adoptees, however, the truths of my beginnings are infinitely more complicated, more painful, and have nothing whatsoever to do with choice.
After finding my family of origin in my early twenties, I was able to piece together a more accurate, nuanced story of my beginnings. A story of a white, working-class girl who benefitted from racial privilege, but lacked any real financial resources or power of her own. A terrified girl. A girl who was pressured, demonized, and ostracized, by her own family and community. A girl who was told by loved ones and professionals that she was unfit to be a mother because she was young and unmarried, because she wouldn’t be able to give me the things I needed, like food or love or a moral compass. Though she wanted to keep me, her parents sent her away to one of those homes where they hid pregnant girls and shamed them into compliance — the kind of place people say didn’t exist after Roe v. Wade. Except this was 1978, half a decade after people who could get pregnant had theoretically won the ability to make more uninhibited choices about whether or not to become parents. My mother, in reality, did not have the ability to make a real, authentic choice. And many pregnant people still do not have this ability. Because a choice made in the absence of other choices has nothing to do with choice.
The fact is, most people who relinquish their children for adoption or have their children taken away from them, both in the U.S. and internationally, do so as a result of economic and racial injustice. In a recent study published by The Donaldson Adoption Institute, only a third of first mothers (often the preferred term instead of “birth mothers”) who were interviewed reported that the decision to relinquish their parental rights was largely based on their own wishes. The number one reason first mothers relinquish their parental rights, according to the DAI report, is lack of financial resources (82%), followed by the absence of social support, and isolation. In addition, most cases of children removed from their families by state intervention and adopted through foster care are reported as cases of neglect, which are typically a result of poverty and the classist and racist biases embedded in the fabric of the child welfare system that deem poor, mostly Black and brown parents as immoral and unfit.
In the case of an unwanted pregnancy, a pregnant person seeking options counseling is ideally given thorough, unbiased, non-judgmental information about their three options: abortion, adoption, and parenting. If a person is even considering adoption, they are typically referred to a local adoption agency by their health-care provider, or they find one on their own. Unfortunately, according to the National Pro-Choice Adoption Collaborative, over 95% of adoption agencies in this country are religiously affiliated. You likely won’t be surprised to hear that adoption professionals are often not giving thorough information about abortion as an option in their counseling practices ― 40% of the mothers in the DAI study said it was never mentioned. But they’re also not presenting parenthood as a viable option, either.
According to the DAI study, most first mothers interviewed reported little to no access to information about parenting from adoption professionals. And yet, the vast majority ― 87% of first mothers in the study ― said their preferred option was in fact to parent their child. It’s just that no one ever told them they had a right to do so, or offered resources to help. Many first mothers report they were already considered “birth mothers” the minute they walked through the agency doors, instead of pregnant people contemplating their options, and that the professionals they worked with unequivocally considered a positive outcome to be a signed and sealed adoption. And these are just some of your standard, run-of-the-mill American adoption agencies; we haven’t even talked about the often criminally coercive crisis pregnancy centers which routinely pressure vulnerable people into relinquishing their children. Or the fact that many private adoptions are facilitated through lawyers as solely financial and legal transactions with zero social services attached to help anyone through this life-altering experience.
As reproductive rights are rolled back, timelines in which people can legally get abortions, should they have the resources and power to access them, are shrinking. This means more people could be left to decide between adoption and parenting as their only viable options. If already abysmal social services are also being rolled back, parenting becomes less of an option. And if adoption is being promoted by the very people who are rolling back our rights, what kind of promotion, what kind of agencies, and what kinds of counseling do we really think will be at the forefront of these efforts?
Here’s a truth that can be hard to hear: Adoption is a trauma. The separation of parents and children, the dismantling of families, even at birth, is very often traumatic and can result in enormous amounts of suffering and lifelong consequences for first parents and adoptees, as well as the families and communities to which they belong. The majority of first parents surveyed say they were never truthfully informed about the potential for trauma, to themselves or their children. They are often told they might feel a little sad for a while and then they’ll get over it — but many don’t. And many parents say they regret their decision, even if they feel like it was probably the right one to make at the time.
Here’s an even harder truth: The adoption industry is a business. It generates billions of dollars each year and requires other people’s children in order to stay profitable.
Here’s the toughest truth yet: Those children are almost always the children of poor and working class people, people of color, native and indigenous people, and young people. The people who adopt them, who directly benefit from the economic and racial oppression of these groups, are most often middle and upper-middle-class people and are primarily white.
The mainstream feminist movement has been, by and large, pro-adoption and has resisted an explicitly intersectional position on the inequities and injustices that typically bring adoptive families together. There are many reasons for this, but here are the two I think about the most:
  Mainstream feminism has historically assumed that the decision to relinquish a child for adoption is a choice that people make freely, and that the people who choose it do so because they don’t believe in abortion.   Mainstream white feminists are part of the primary demographic that stands to benefit the most from adoption.  
There will likely always be children who need to be adopted into loving families and held tightly by those families, their communities, and high quality support services across a lifetime. But if, as feminists, we believe that all people should have the ability to make informed and supported choices about becoming parents or not, then we should work to make these instances rare. That means, of course, there will be fewer adoptable children, but we must understand that families are not interchangeable and that the desire to become a parent through adoption does not make anyone entitled to someone else’s child. As it stands in this country, market forces in adoption, coupled with racist and classist state interventions and a reductive societal narrative that sees adoption as a fairy-tale ending where everybody wins, mean that people who have class and race privilege will continue to build their own families through the constrained choices, coercion, and loss of those who do not. This is a feminist issue.
The Reproductive Justice movement, pioneered and led by Black feminists and women of color, teaches us that all people should have “the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities.” If we think about adoption through this lens, and in particular, the right to parent the children we have, we see that we must ask something very different of mainstream feminism. Committing ourselves to reproductive justice, to human rights, demands that we fight for the economic and racial justice to ensure all pregnant people are able to make informed, authentic decisions for themselves, and that families who want to stay together have the autonomy and support necessary to do so.
I want to challenge feminist organizations and activists to incorporate an intersectional understanding of and position on adoption as part of their reproductive platforms. Read adoptee and first parent experiences. Listen to adoptee scholars, writers, activists, and artists. Listen to families who have been disrupted or broken through state intervention. Have the hard conversations. From the Women’s March to Planned Parenthood to local grassroots organizing, there is much room for complexity, nuance, and growth around this issue. Feminists have a responsibility to take this on.

When we are flying, I do my best to keep the chaos to a minimum, but chances are I'm more bothered by my child's crying than the guy across the row from me is.",2015-02-11,FAMILY,"This has got to stop. I remember seeing that first picture go viral. You know the one where the parents put together a small package of goodies for other passengers who ""had"" to share the plane with their baby? It included a note apologizing in advance for their baby being on the flight. I thought that first note was cute, but something just didn't sit right with me. 

As time went on, I started seeing more and more of these notes popping up on the Internet. Last week, my friend and fellow blogger Derek received one of these pre-apology packages on a flight he took (it's the picture above). I finally realized why these bug me so much. I am not of the opinion that parents should have to apologize for bringing their kids places, including on planes. Newsflash: People are actually allowed to travel with their families, and even their (gasp!) babies. Sometimes parents and babies even need to use planes. The last time I checked, leaving your baby home alone isn't good for the kid, and you might just end up in jail as well. The alternative is taking the baby on the flight with you. Although for some parents, this might seem worse than jail.
I know. Sometimes babies cry, poop, make loud noises, or throw food at you. So do other people who travel by plane -- so get over it. Invest in some earplugs or a good pair of headphones. Maybe you have never traveled with your own kids before. It is similar to trying to corral a spider monkey who has just mainlined three cups of espresso. Sounds fun, right? I have three children of my own, and not once have I thought, ""Hey, maybe I should drop everything, write a pre-apology note, and put together a gift bag for people on my flight."" My wife and I are usually too busy stressing out about packing for five people, dividing up carry-on responsibilities, and getting through security without losing track of a kid. 
However, if this practice of pre-apology packets must continue, then there are some other passengers I want presents from long before I expect a parent to hand me a gift bag. 
I want an apology package from the lady who fully reclines her seat directly into my kneecaps for the entire flight. How about a little something from the guy who goes comatose next to me the moment the plane leaves the ground? It takes a contortionist just to slip by him to use the bathroom. While we're at it, how about a present from the foul-smelling passenger? You know, the person who either takes a bath in perfume or carries on the meal that you can smell from the front of the plane. Whatever the source of their odor, they are oblivious to the other passengers passing out around them.
Maybe what I'm suggesting is a bit ridiculous, but so is having to pre-apologize for bringing my baby on a plane. So let's just stop with the apology notes and gift bags from parents, and also the judging looks from other passengers. The next time a baby is crying, remember that maybe your habits are just as annoying to the person next to you as that baby is to you. Perhaps you might even go the extra mile and offer some encouragement to the weary parents. They are probably just wondering how they will survive the flight. Give a friendly smile, or even some kind words. 
The truth of the matter is that my baby has just as much right to be on a plane as any adult. When we are flying, I do my best to keep the chaos to a minimum, but chances are I'm more bothered by my child's crying than the guy across the row from me is. If you want a noise-free flight, maybe you should pony up the money to rent your own private plane.
If my baby does lose it, I will put all my energy, and whatever time is left in the flight, toward calming him down and making sure it doesn't happen again. All most parents ask for is a little understanding and an extra measure of patience from others. I know many passengers are more than willing to offer this. This bit of kindness can do wonders to refresh an exhausted parent who is in the middle of his or her stressful family ""adventure."" 
So the next time I'm flying, I plan to cut other parents some slack -- and I want to see the same from you. However, if you are one of those other passengers I mentioned, I expect my pre-apology packet as soon as I see you board.

Siegel, M.D., ContributorNew York Times Bestselling Author, Neuropsychiatrist, Mindsigh...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-series-on-parenting-with-the-brain-in-mind_b_6924506.html,"As a parent, you can learn the kinds of communication patterns that will make the growth of your child's brain optimized.",2015-03-24,FAMILY,"When we become parents, we want the best for our children. Fortunately, the scientific understanding of how children develop within families has grown to the point where we can now state what the essential aspects of healthy development are. In this series of entries, I will offer you ways of understanding the science of parenting so that you can both understand the ideas and apply the principles in ways that can make your parenting more effective and more enjoyable.
The science we will be drawing upon comes from connecting all the various divisions of science together into one framework of understanding. That approach is called ""interpersonal neurobiology,"" and I am proud to be the founding editor of the professional series of books that focus on this field. Instead of referring to the research and academic articles, here I will instead offer you the ""take home"" lessons that emerge from this synthesis of science. If you are interested in more of the science, I recommend the university textbook I wrote, The Developing Mind: How relationships and the brain interact to shape who we are, Second Edition (2012). If you enjoy just the scientific ideas themselves, without the references to the research itself, then try Pocket Guide to Interpersonal Neurobiology: An integrative handbook of the mind (2012). 
For our exploration of parenting, lets begin with several foundational notions. The first is that the child will develop based on both information in her genes and experiences she has in her life. 
Genes contain information that guides the growth of the cells of the body, including the basic cells of the brain, the neurons. How neurons link to each other in synaptic connections shapes the brain's structure. And this synaptic structure shapes how mental processes -- like emotions, thoughts, memories and behavioral control -- will be created. In this way, our genetic legacy we inherit from both parents shapes, in part, who we become and what our temperament is. 
But experience also plays a direct role in how the neurons in the brain unfold, therefore also shaping how the mind functions. Experience can be defined as how energy and information stream through our lives -- within our nervous system, including the brain, and between ourselves and other people and the larger world around us. Experience is energy flow. And we now know that all information rides upon patterns of energy flow, like the shapes of these words entering your eye. Photons come from the squiggles that are the words, hit the back of your eye, stimulate firing in your optic nerve, shape firing patterns in your visual cortex and then spread around to the linguistic centers and other regions to help create your experience of reading this entry. All of that is ""experience."" 
Experience means that neurons are firing and becoming active. And when neurons fire together, they can wire together. The location and the timing of that firing in the brain depends on the type of experience that is unfolding. And neuronal firing can activate genes so that proteins are produced and new connections among the firing neurons are established.
Here is the amazing thing: Communication is how we share energy and information flow with each other. How you communicate with your child shapes patterns in your child's brain and therefore can shape how the structure of his brain develops. Since relationships are the ways we communicate with each other, this means that relationships not only activate the brain, they shape the anatomical development of brain structure.
Here is the great news about this: As a parent, you can learn the kinds of communication patterns that will make the growth of your child's brain optimized. And it's not so hard to learn! The simple reality of parenting and brain development is that communication that is ""integrative"" stimulates the growth of ""integrative"" fibers in your child's brain. Let's unpack that simple statement.
After examining tens of thousands of studies, it became clear that a simple principle of healthy living emerged. When we link the different aspects of our lives, we create something called integration. Integration is the linkage of differentiated parts of a system. For example, in your brain, you have a different left and right side. When the two sides can be specialized, or develop in unique ways, that is what we mean by differentiated. And then when we link these two differentiated parts -- when they are allowed to be unique and specialized but then brought into connection -- we create an integrated whole. 
So, integration is not the same as blending together and making differences disappear. And integration is not the same as just having different things exist, but not be connected. When we link differentiated parts, we create the integration that enables ""the whole to be greater than the sum of its parts."" 
When a system is integrated, it functions optimally.
When a system is not integrated, it tends toward either chaos or rigidity, and sometimes even both at the same time.
But when a system, whether it is a brain or a family, is integrated, it has a sense of harmony. It is the most flexible, adaptive, energized and stable. So like a river, the central flow of integration is harmony; the two banks are chaos and rigidity. Chaos in a family might be when emotions are exploding out of control or when intrusive memories make it hard to hear what others are saying. Rigidity might be when people feel depleted or demoralized, depressed and lacking in vitality. These examples of chaos or rigidity can last for minutes or hours, and sometimes even days, weeks or months. When they are present, they suggest that the system is not integrated.
For a parent, this view suggests that you can learn how to detect chaos and rigidity in your family and do something to create the differentiation and linkage that will make your family more integrated. And over time, the more integration you create with your child in your communication, the more integrated her brain will become. Integrative communication is when you honor differences and promote compassionate linkages. You let go of your fixed, rigid expectations and come to see your child for who he actually is, rather than try to make him only what you want him to be. If he is shy and reserved but you wanted an outgoing social child, you accept him for who he is and support him developing from where he is coming from, not from your disappointment in him. And when integration happens like that, your child will ""feel felt"" by you, feel understood and accepted, and can become the best him that he can become. That is created because your accepting his unique qualities and encouraging him to find his own inner strength will cultivate integration in his brain. 
Integration in the brain is the basis for resilience.
When different areas of the brain, like left or right or up and down, are then linked, optimal integration is created. This whole brain integration in turn creates optimal self-regulation and children develop emotional intelligence, social skills, attentional focus, behavioral flexibility, compassion and creativity. Not bad? If you want to begin first with integrating yourself, I wrote a book with Mary Hartzell that we'll explore next month called Parenting from the Inside Out: How a deeper self-understanding can help you raise children who thrive that teaches you how to do just that. And if you want to see how to apply these ideas of integration to your child directly, I wrote with Tina Bryson the book, The Whole-Brain Child , that teaches you how to do that too. We'll discuss that also in future entries. 
So that's our starting point! I look forward to connecting with you more in our future entries! Thanks for reading!

626,PARENTS,Is Your Boy Bully Potential? 5 Ways to Avoid,"Dr. Peggy Drexler, ContributorAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholar",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-your-boy-bully-potenti_b_6382152.html,"Boys of parents who encourage high standards and moral courage have an easier time thinking independently and standing up for what they believe in. And that can be as simple as being brave yourself: After all, you are the best role model for your son.",2014-12-26,FAMILY,"*Quentin, three-and-a-half, was happily darting around the playground, like usual, when out of nowhere another little boy kicked him in the shins. Quentin looked stunned, like he couldn't believe what had just happened. But he didn't kick back. First, he cried for a few minutes -- not unusual for a small child. But then he collected himself and walked right up to the boy and said calmly but with emotion. ""I do not like what you did. I would not kick you -- you should never kick, and that's the truth!""
We have a lot to learn from him Quentin. He's one example of a stable, independent, caring boy. But it's possible for all parents to raise morally-grounded boys. 
Parents, instilling morals and values come from one place and that is YOU. 
So:
1. Let him be him. 
Accept your child for who he is, rather than trying to mold him into your vision of who you think he should be. By allowing your child his own space to move beyond you and establish his own sense of identity, you open him up to a world of possibilities and give him the chance to live up to his potential. Expand -- rather than constrict -- your child's life by not imposing your own fears or limitations on him.
When I was a new, inexperienced mother I sent my small son, to a preschool in which ALL the two-year-olds were expected to shake hands with the woman who ran school as they arrived. My son refused to shake hands although occasionally he would try to slip her a ""high five."" Rather than question the demands the school was placing on its preschoolers -- or let my son be himself -- I initially assumed I had done something wrong.
2. Encourage independence... 
Do this by letting your child do whatever he can by himself, from sounding out letters to pouring a cup of juice to carrying his dishes to the sink. Help facilitate the process for your boy, but don't do the task for him. One mom I met made clean up easier for her three boys by storing little dustpans and brooms under each sink including their play area. 
Encourage responsibility by having your child set -- and then live up to -- his own goals and expectations. Through this, he will consciously examine and develop his own morals and values.
3. ...but make him feel like a part of the team. 
Instill responsibility and moral strength in your boy by making him an active and engaged member of the household. Expect him to do his share of the chores and other age-appropriate duties. By the time he was 6, Quentin was already earning his allowance by pulling sheets off the bed, helping with the laundry, setting the table, bagging the paper for recycling, and washing the salad for dinner. His mom said, ""We told him, everybody works in this family. Nobody gets to sit and be waited on."" And, in fact, Quentin liked having jobs that were his. Give your boy the ability to feel like he has a role, and is an important part of the team.
4. Enforce boundaries. 
Parents whose style can be described as both involved and considered raise reflective, conscious, centered boys with a sense of identity and moral fiber. That means enforcing firm limits and sticking to clear boundaries, but without harshness. Let him know what's right -- and what's not -- when it comes to the treatment of other family members, their friends, and strangers. Help him negotiate family decisions while expressing a broad range of feelings. Do this by talking to, and with, your boy using emotional and empathic language, and discussing morality as it relates to broader social situations. One parent told their kids, ""you are my emissaries,"" keeping them in line by making it clear they represented not just themselves, but their Mom as well, out in the world.
In my observations, boys of parents who encourage high standards and moral courage have an easier time thinking independently and standing up for what they believe in. And that can be as simple as being brave yourself: After all, you are the best role model for your son.
5. Make a commitment to non-sexist parenting. 
We've been raised in a society where mother-son closeness is approached with suspicion. But I learned that a mother's ability to connect with her son -- including letting him know how she was feeling, acknowledging her own mistakes, and treating his feelings with respect -- helps him extend that sense of connection and closeness to others. In the case of boys, the son may grow up with great respect and openness, and to be the sort of openhearted man women are purported to want to marry.
Eight-year-old Mac was extremely close to his best friend, Alec. After playing rough and tough out in the backyard, they'd come inside and read a book side by side and just talk. When Alec transferred to another school, Mac said he was lonely. Mac's mother took her son's sadness seriously, and encouraged him to express his feelings. She gave him the gift of caring and insight; in turn, he gave that back more easily to the people in his family and his schoolmates.

The next, I sigh, my body softens, and I could not be happier. Literally. The highs are so high, they completely dissolve the lows.",2014-08-20,FAMILY,"Parenting kinda sucks. 
And it's also the best thing ever. Often at exactly the same time.  This morning, for example, I was tired and in no mood for usual. That's what Noah and I call our morning ritual of playing a game or drawing a picture together on the couch after he wakes up. I was even less in the mood for Gwen to be under-slept and grumpy and for Benji to be 3 years old and in tears if I sliced his French toast in the wrong direction. Which I did. So this morning sucked.  And it was also miraculous. Gwen was in the bathroom with Noah, brushing his hair. I was standing in the kitchen checking email on my iPhone while Benji finished his breakfast at the kitchen table. I watched as he ate. He's at the stage of being exactly the size of a small Ewok. He even moves like one and he has an Ewok's focus and attention. He was totally absorbed in the work of eating his breakfast. First his French toast. Then, with a don't mind if I do glance, he moved his French toast plate out of the way and swapped in his bowl of oatmeal.  Benji now attends a nursery program two mornings a week. Last week, his teacher taught him to lean over his oatmeal bowl during snack so that he'll drip into the bowl and not onto his sweater. So this morning he sits up a bit straighter to get some height and bends over the bowl to avoid spilling. The way he leans forward with his tiny body, so intentional, jutting his neck out to drip into the bowl, is so cute, I am swooning. Sometimes the love is almost too much to hold. For a split second, my knees go weak; I'm a preteen girl at a Justin Bieber concert.  One minute I am stressed and miserable. The next, I sigh, my body softens, and I could not be happier. Literally. The highs are so high, they completely dissolve the lows.  And what's the alternative, anyway? What did I do that was so great when I actually had time? Would I rather be sitting on the couch watching a movie? Going to a yoga class? Sleeping in? No. Of course not. Okay, yes. Yes, I would.  But not really. As New York magazine concluded in their famous 2010 article, ""All Joy and No Fun,"" day to day, parents are less happy and more stressed, but in the long run they feel a deep sense of purpose and are more satisfied.  So having kids exposes you to transcendent moments of love, connection and happiness, but day to day, everyone is stressed, no one is sleeping, and there hasn't been sex in weeks or even months. This is why it is not a good time to make big life decisions.  I have a little rule for myself. Before I ram the car in front of me for driving below the speed limit, I ask myself, ""Have I slept less than seven consecutive hours, eaten six brownies, or had a fight with Gwen?"" If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then I give the driver a second chance before he meets the front end of my Corolla.  The same must be true for our partners.  We must advocate for our needs, but also give them time and space. And we must accept a certain amount of chaos and discord. Bottom line, I don't think couples with small children should be allowed to divorce. With no time to connect, lacking sleep and always feeling overwhelmed, parents of very small children, it seems to me, are not of sound mind to make such a life-changing decision. (Unless they are. Sometimes divorce, I suppose, is the only option. Obviously if there is abuse. Or if partners realize that they are truly incompatible.)  But otherwise, the person you married will likely return in a few years when the kids are older, and a divorce would screw all that up.  After Gwen gave birth, she changed from Anne of Green Gables to Beowolf. (I think it's been long enough now that I can joke about this. Right, honey? Honey?) And I don't really blame her; years of not sleeping and putting your own needs third will do that to a person.  But then, like the Hulk returning to Bruce Banner, slowly, over time, she returned. One morning she woke up, blinked a few times and said, ""Whoa, where have I been?"" And that was it; my Gwen was back. God forbid we had divorced; I'd have missed out on a lifetime of loving her.

628,PARENTS,"When It Comes to Parenting, You Gotta Have Faith","Tammy Leigh Kahn, ContributorTechnology Entrepreneur",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/when-it-comes-to-parenting-you-gotta-have-faith_b_7070174.html,"What if we replace guilt with faith? Faith that we can exist in a world where we work hard, take care of our kids but also take care of ourselves and trust that they will be ok.",2015-04-15,FAMILY,"Let me start this piece by saying I am not a researcher, nor am I child psychologist. What I am is a working mother of a 5-year-old boy.
Recently, there was a study that came out that suggested that parenting time doesn't matter in a child's ultimate success in life. It didn't seem to add up to me, and while it seemed like a bit of a relief that the hours I spend away from my child aren't affecting him, I knew there was probably something wrong. The word ""Duh!"" comes to mind...
Justin Wolfer, journalist for The New York Times dug deeper, and he found out what I had felt must be the case: The study is skewed, so you're not getting off the hook for spending time with your kid. (Nor do most parents want to, but we are tired, we are overworked, and we are burning it at both ends...)
It got me thinking about the choices we have to make as parents, and how difficult it can sometimes be. Is spending time with my kiddo important? Absolutely, and for a long time I thought work-life balance meant that I work, and I leave time for my kid. But I've been learning more recently that there's a third part, that I think, we as parents are inclined to neglect... for the best possible reasons too -- because we love our kids so damn much. That third part is our own happiness. Outside of work and outside of being a parent, finding joy in our life that is not tied directly to our children. 
The reason, I believe, parents wanted the skewed study to be true comes from fear, and ultimately, guilt. I'm no exception... I have guilt for the business trips, for working and missing the karate classes, for.... not always being there. And that's before I even factor in taking any time for myself.
So, I started thinking, what if we replace guilt with faith?  
Faith that we can exist in a world where we work hard, take care of our kids but also take care of ourselves and trust that they will be ok. I put this out to friends, co-workers, anyone who would answer. I was immediately struck by how it resonated with so many people -- single dads, single moms, divorced couples, happily married folks. All of them with one thing in common: they want their kids to thrive, but they would love to have a life in the process, and all pretty much agree that they would be better parents if they did. One person I spoke with summed it up simply and beautifully:
""The best gift i can give my child is showing him what a happy person looks like.""
I'm reminded of the expression ""do what I say not what I do."" I want my child to grow up with a healthy sense that he matters in this world, so what would I be showing him if I didn't find a way to take care of myself, and show him that I matter as well? This is hard because we want to protect them... But kids are insightful -- they know if we are phoning it in. They know if we are faking it. 
 (Creating moments with my son: The Annual Easter Egg Hunt)
So, how do we balance it all? Perhaps the question is better phrased like this:
How do we give our kids the best of ourselves during the times that we are there?  To me, it's a matter of quality. It's so easy to be there without actually being present. We live in a world of distractions, cell phones, computers, and good lord even now our watches are becoming devices connected to the digital world, so it can be very difficult to unplug enough to be there. I believe that one hour of true quality time is better than four hours of half-assed, cell-phone-attached-to-my-hand time, so I try everyday to be mindful of this.
It's about love.
As I typed this article on a train from Boston to NYC, I saw a mother sitting with her 16-year-old son. I decided to break the rules of train travel and talk to the person across from me, so put the question to her that I had already put out to so many people, just to see what a complete stranger would say to me. Once she realized I wasn't a lunatic but was actually making pleasant conversation on Amtrak, she thought about it, and her response was brilliant. I believe is a fitting conclusion to this article.
She said that while she was fortunate to have a job that kept her close to home for most of her kids lives, she believes that the most important thing a child can feel is loved, and the more of it the better. Parents are great, she said, but if you can ever get the whole ""it takes a village"" thing going for your kids, they will be surrounded by so much love that they will absolutely thrive. So maybe that's it. Maybe we need to, as a society pull together more, help each other, and in that, perhaps we can also thrive ourselves and give our kids the best gift we can give them: showing them what a happy person looks like.

This was the only way you were able to watch 17 minutes of Dallas Buyers Club (and therefore be able to speak confidently about Matthew McConaughey's Oscar chances) and 42 minutes of the Sandra Bullock/Melissa McCarthy fun fest, The Heat (and never tell anyone you stayed in the drier an extra half hour because you were shamefully amused).
Before you hustle off for your next You Don't Know Jacques! session, be warned: This is a tale of two Sandra Bullocks. 
They'll be playing The Blind Side. Again. Just like they've been doing since it came out. And when it ends, front desk person will start up something that is 100 percent not the light, female buddy cop flick you wanted.

In an email sent by the White House Wednesday, ""Back to the Future"" actor Michael J. Fox encouraged greater awareness of Parkinson's disease and urged Americans to participate in a series of online conversations dedicated to medical research and other scientific topics.
""Call me an optimist, but I believe that by 2045 we’ll find the cures we seek -- especially because of all the smart, passionate people working to make it happen,"" Fox wrote.

632,POLITICS,#4 Not Our Finest Hour: Why Is Liberal America Falling So Far Short?,"Andy Schmookler, ContributorAward-winning author of What We're Up Against, former...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/-4-not-our-finest-hour-wh_b_5893502.html,"In countless ways, the political force that has arisen on the right has moved this nation toward tyranny and cruelty and serfdom. Why has Liberal America in these times shown so little of the spirit of America's heroic forebears?",2014-09-30,POLITICS,"Summary: We in Liberal America are now embattled. America has been in kindred battles before, and on those occasions to which we look to see our finest American ideals expressed and embodied, great American leaders have shown the way: ""See the evil. Call it out. Press the battle."" But in this crisis, in this battle, Liberal America is falling far short of our nation's finest ideals. Why is that?
The American electorate is probably about to give more power to a party of traitors. 
This statement, though shocking, can be verified by these steps (many of which are substantiated here):
  The Republican Party (""the Party of No"") has chosen to prevent anything from being accomplished.
 To choose across-the-board obstructionism is to knowingly hurt the nation. 
 The Republicans' motivation for obstructionism is to regain power.
 To sacrifice the good of the country to gain greater power over it is to betray the nation.
 The dictionary definition of ""traitor"" is ""a person who betrays a friend, country, principle..."" 
 Most pollsters say that, in the upcoming elections, this ""Party of No"" will gain seats in the House and the Senate. 
What's wrong with America that a political party can act in such a disgraceful way and profit from it? 
Something must be amiss with those who will vote for so demonstrably traitorous a party. 
But something is also wrong with the part of the American body politic that opposes the Republicans -- i.e. Liberal America.
Compare how Liberal America is dealing with this destructive force with what Americans, through their greatest leaders, have done in their finest hours: the nation's founding, the Civil War, and the World War against fascism. 
In all three crises, the leaders we regard as heroes understood the evil they were up against, called it out, and fought for values they held sacred.
The Declaration of Independence spends most of its words decrying King George III's ""repeated injuries and usurpations"" which they saw as working toward ""the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States."" The document ended by declaring such a tyrant ""unfit to be the ruler of a free people."" Just government, our Founders declared, requires ""the consent of the governed."" They argued on the basis of the ""self-evident"" truth ""that all men are created equal, [and] that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights..."" 
They understood that declaring these rights would require them to fight, which is why they conclude the document by mutually pledging ""to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.""
We see the same willingness to fight for sacred values in Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln rose to the presidency on his opposition to slavery. He framed that opposition in terms of the same values on this basis of which our Founders declared independence: that ""all men are created equal,"" and that ""no man is good enough to govern another man, without that other's consent.""
Lincoln saw the conflict over slavery in fundamental moral terms: ""Slavery is founded in the selfishness of man's nature -- opposition to it, in his love of justice. These principles are an eternal antagonism."" ""If slavery is not wrong,"" Lincoln said, ""nothing is wrong."" 
Lincoln did not want war. But to keep slavery from expanding -- and to preserve the Union -- he was ready to fight.
If Abraham Lincoln is ranked by historians as our greatest president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt is ranked second. FDR presided over two great national crises: the Great Depression and World War II. Running for a second term, FDR called out ""the forces of selfishness and of lust for power."" In his State of the Union speech after America's entry into the Second World War, FDR characterized the conflict in terms that Lincoln and the Founders would have recognized: ""We are fighting, as our fathers have fought, to uphold the doctrine that all men are equal in the sight of God."" The other side, he said, is fighting to to destroy ""this deep belief and create a world... of tyranny and cruelty and serfdom."" 
President Roosevelt shrank from neither battle: ""I welcome their hatred"" he said of anti-democratic forces at home. And against the forces of cruel fascism abroad, he brought the power of the United States to bear as quickly as public opinion and events would allow.
See the evil. Call it out. Press the battle. That's what America's heroes have done. 
But that theme has been missing, or woefully weak, with President Obama and in Liberal America more generally, even though the same basic values are at stake today as in those earlier crises. 
The forms of ""the consent of the governed"" remain. But never in U.S. history have so many been deceived about the true nature of the political force they are supporting. (Government based on misinformed consent is hardly just.) 
The idea of equality remains, but the Republican Party has labored -- the Citizens United decision being their most obvious success -- to widen inequality of power in our supposedly democratic process. In countless ways, the political force that has arisen on the right has moved this nation toward tyranny and cruelty and serfdom.
Why has Liberal America in these times shown so little of the spirit of America's heroic forebears?

634,POLITICS,Mayor Apologizes For Citing WWII Japanese Internment Camps In Rejecting Refugees,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roanoke-mayor-internment-camps_us_564f7128e4b0258edb316857,He said he had no idea his comments would go viral.,2015-11-20,POLITICS,"Roanoke Mayor David Bowers (D) apologized Friday for praising the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, saying he had no idea so many people would notice his statement.
""I apologize to all those offended by my remarks,"" Bowers said at a special meeting of the Roanoke City Council. ""No one else is to be blamed but me.""
Bowers' troubles started Wednesday, when he came out against aiding Syrian refugees in the wake of the Paris attacks. He said all assistance should cease ""until these serious hostilities and atrocities end, or at the very least until regarded as under control by U.S. authorities, and normalcy is restored."" 
""I'm reminded that President Franklin D. Roosevelt felt compelled to sequester Japanese foreign nationals after the bombing of Pearl Harbor,"" he added, ""and it appears that the threat of harm to America from ISIS is now just as real and serious as that from our enemies then.""
Bowers quickly faced national criticism, perhaps most vocally from within his own party. 
Rep. Mike Honda (D-Calif.), who lived in an internment camp, and Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz put out a joint statement saying that ""his rhetoric has no place in our party."" Bowers also lost his spot on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's Virginia Leadership Council. 
In his apology Friday, Bowers said his comments were ""a personal political view"" issued ""in a statement on mayor's office stationery"" and resisted calls for his resignation.
""I anticipated that the statement might receive some coverage in the Roanoke Valley, but I did not in any way anticipate that it would trend internationally over the Internet,"" he said.
""It's just not in my heart to be racist or bigoted,"" he added. ""My statement was intended to be respectful -- was intended to be respectful -- measured and moderate in tone and substance, but it fell short obviously.""
In the wake of the Paris attacks, a growing number of U.S. politicians have called for the United States to impose tighter restrictions -- or close its doors completely -- to refugees fleeing war-torn Syria. Their concerns center around the fear that terrorists could pose as refugees and enter the country, even though none of the Paris attackers have so far been identified as Syrian.

Ted Cruz (R) and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) seemed homophobic and had failed to adequately address questions about their stances on LGBTQ issues.
Page confronted Cruz at the Iowa State Fair last month and asked him why he wouldn't stand up against discrimination toward LGBTQ individuals. Cruz responded by telling Page that Americans shouldn't be forced to do things that were against their religious beliefs. The Republican presidential hopeful also tried to pivot away from domestic LGBTQ issues and asked why the Obama administration wasn't doing more to stand up for gay people killed in Iran or by ISIS.
Even though Cruz said that he was ""happy to answer [her] question, but not to have a back-and-forth debate,” Page -- who came out as gay last year -- said that the Texas senator's answers weren't satisfactory.
""I’ve seen multiple videos and read multiple quotes of Ted Cruz discussing gay issues, as well as Mike Huckabee, and it goes exactly as you’d expect. They don’t answer the question,"" she told The Daily Beast in an interview published Saturday. ""They say you’re cutting them off when you try to ask the same question again because they’re not answering it, because the reality is that they might be homophobic people. To me, it seems like they’re homophobic people.""
Page said that the GOP was ignoring public support in its own party for same-sex marriage. In May polls, a record high percentage of Americans expressed support for gay marriage, though that support did differ among party lines. While a majority of Democrats and independents supported same-sex marriage in a May Gallup poll, just 37 percent of Republicans in the Gallup poll were inclined to support it.
""We live in a culture where even the majority of young Republicans are in favor of same-sex marriage -- and I mean Republican constituents, not the people running for president,"" Page said. ""I don’t know what to say other than it went exactly as expected. It just goes to ISIS and Iran and who knows where.""

636,POLITICS,Afghanistan: The Gateway Drug For Three Administrations,"Tom Engelhardt, ContributorEditor, TomDispatch.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/afghanistan-the-gateway-drug-for-three-administrations_us_5a091767e4b05673aa5a2d60,"Cross-posted with TomDispatch.com As you read “Into the Afghan Abyss (Again)” by historian Alfred McCoy, author most recently",2017-11-13,POLITICS,"Cross-posted with TomDispatch.com
As you read “Into the Afghan Abyss (Again)” by historian Alfred McCoy, author most recently of In the Shadows of the American Century: The Rise and Decline of U.S. Global Power, think of Afghanistan as the gateway drug for three Washington administrations. Within weeks of the 9/11 attacks, George W. Bush and his top officials had launched their invasion of that country and soon knocked off the Taliban (rather than simply going after Osama bin Laden and his followers). That “victory,” however ephemeral, acted as the policy equivalent of a drug high for the president and his crew of geopolitical dreamers who promptly turned their attention to Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and nailing down the rest of the oil heartlands of the planet. (And you know just how well that went in mission-accomplished terms.) 
In 2009-2010, Afghanistan (“the right war”) would prove the gateway drug for Barack Obama as he surged in 30,000 troops, along with mini-surges of contractors, CIA agents, Special Forces soldiers, and others. Before he was done, from Libya to Iraq, the Afghan War would be the least of his problems. 
And finally, of course, there’s Donald Trump, who, in the years leading up to his election victory, spoke or tweeted as if he might take a different approach to Afghanistan, but then surrounded himself with three generals from America’s losing wars and once again decided to do the usual Afghan thing. Now, he, too, is hooked and, from Niger to Somalia and beyond, the results are already coming in. 
Though seldom thought of that way (except perhaps by McCoy), Afghanistan is not just the longest war in American history but possibly the longest opium war in anyone’s history. And sixteen years later, here’s one thing we can take for granted about what’s likely to happen: in the end, it never goes well. If we know less than we should about how badly it’s going right now, part of that can be explained by the policies of those most deeply hooked on the war. When things go badly for them, they turn off the information spigot, as in 2015 when the American command in Afghanistan cut off all public release of material on “U.S.-taxpayer-funded efforts to build, train, equip, and sustain the Afghan National Security Forces.” That was, of course, at the point when almost $65 billion had already been poured into training and equipping those forces and they were failing nationwide. 
Since then, we know that Afghan police and military casualties have soared, desertions have risen, “ghost soldiers” fill many units (with their commanders and others skimming off their salaries), and the Taliban has gained control of ever more of the country. In response, the U.S. command there has again “classified and restricted once-public information regarding the state of Afghan security forces, including ‘casualties, personnel strength, attrition, capability assessments, and operational readiness of equipment.’”
And so it goes in America’s drug war in South Asia. Someday, the high will truly wear off and then who knows where we’ll be. In the meantime, read McCoy and think about what this repetitive version of war making means so many years later.

637,POLITICS,Paul Ryan Endorses Donald Trump,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-endorses-donald-trump_us_57508404e4b0eb20fa0d34fe,So much for holding out on that.,2016-06-02,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON -- In an unceremonious op-ed in his local paper, Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.) ended his dithering on the presumptive GOP presidential nominee and said he would vote for Donald Trump in November.
Ryan, who had been holding out on endorsing Trump, said the focus of his conversations with the real estate mogul were on the House's policy agenda.
""Through these conversations, I feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve people’s lives,"" Ryan writes, 666 words into an 806-word op-ed in the GazetteXtra. ""That’s why I’ll be voting for him this fall.""
Ryan says one person he knows won't support his agenda is Hillary Clinton.
""A Clinton White House would mean four more years of liberal cronyism and a government more out for itself than the people it serves,"" Ryan writes. ""Quite simply, she represents all that our agenda aims to fix.""
There was speculation last week that Ryan might declare support for Trump. But he told reporters soon after those stories broke that he wasn't any closer to an endorsement.
A few days away from the Capitol seem to have changed that for the Wisconsin Republican.
Ryan had previously denounced Trump for his proposed ban on Muslims, the businessman's weak effort to distance himself from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and the violence at Trump’s rallies.
He then appeared on CNN on May 5, two days after Trump had effectively wrapped up the nomination, and told Jake Tapper that he couldn’t endorse Trump “at this point.”
“This is the party of Lincoln, of Reagan, of Jack Kemp,” Ryan said at the time. “And we don’t always nominate a Lincoln and a Reagan every four years, but we hope that our nominee aspires to be Lincoln- and Reagan-esque.”
Ryan said he wanted to see Trump unify the Republican Party and run a campaign that will allow Americans to ""have something that they're proud to support and proud to be a part of.""
Two days after Trump went before the press and bashed journalists for questioning whether he had actually donated the $6 million he said he raised for veterans, Ryan apparently decided Trump had changed his tone enough to earn his endorsement.
He writes in the op-ed published Thursday that he’s spent most of his adult life pursuing ways to help “protect the ‘American Idea’ — the notion that the condition of one’s birth does not determine the outcome of one’s life.”
Ryan says the first step in that is putting ideas on paper and having a real debate. “And with the Obama presidency nearing an end, we have a real opportunity to get big things done the next four years,” he says.
He goes on to preview an agenda that House Republicans will start rolling out next week.
“To enact these ideas, we need a Republican president willing to sign them into law,” Ryan writes. “That’s why, when he sealed the nomination, I could not offer my support for Donald Trump before discussing policies and basic principles.""
Ryan says he held out on his endorsement to help unite Republicans.
“And if we’re going to unite, it has to be over ideas,” he continues.
Trump himself has been cagey about what ideas he actually endorses, recently seeming to flip-flop on a pledge that he wouldn’t touch Social Security.
But Republicans such as Ryan seem satisfied with whatever it is Trump stands for on this given day.
Still, Ryan’s endorsement does come with some political distance. Ryan says it’s “no secret” that he and Trump have differences.
“I won’t pretend otherwise,” Ryan says. “And when I feel the need to, I’ll continue to speak my mind.”
“But,” Ryan continues, “the reality is, on the issues that make up our agenda, we have more common ground than disagreement.”

638,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Eviscerates Donald Trump In Her Best Speech Yet,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-donald-trump_us_57508150e4b0eb20fa0d31f9,"She called his foreign policy ""dangerously incoherent"" and said he was ""temperamentally unfit"" to serve as president.",2016-06-02,POLITICS,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton characterized Donald Trump's approach to the world as “dangerously incoherent” on Thursday in a scorching speech about national security and foreign policy in San Diego. 
Clinton made the case that a Trump administration would pursue a risky and unpredictable foreign policy agenda, one that would threaten the United States’ relationships with its allies. 
“Donald Trump’s ideas aren’t just different, they are dangerously incoherent,” she said. “They’re not even really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies. He is not just unprepared, he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility.” 
The election, Clinton added, presented “a choice between a fearful America that’s less secure and less engaged with the world and a strong, confident America that leads to keep our country safe and our economy growing.” 
Clinton had a lot of material to get through. She recited some of Trump’s past statements on foreign policy, provoking laughter from the audience when she noted that he said he understands Russia because he held the Miss Universe pageant there. She also mentioned his past support for increased nuclear proliferation, taking out the families of terrorists and defaulting on the national debt, and mocked his remark that his primary consultant on foreign policy issues is himself, because he has a “very good brain.”
She ridiculed him for saying that climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese and criticized his statement that he prefers prisoners of war who weren’t captured, like Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was. 
“This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes, because it’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because someone got under his very thin skin,” Clinton said. “We cannot put the security of our children and grandchildren in Donald Trump’s hands, we cannot let him roll the dice with America.” 
Clinton noted that Trump has praised leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un, declaring he has a “bizarre fascination with dictators and strongmen.” 
“I will leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants,” she said.
She also criticized Trump for his suggestion that the United States should scale back its involvement in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
""If Donald gets his way, they’ll be celebrating in the Kremlin,"" she said. ""We cannot let that happen.""
Clinton had to balance the temptation to spend her entire speech mocking Trump with her desire to appear presidential, which is perhaps why she spoke in front of a backdrop of American flags in San Diego, a city that has a strong connection to the military. 
She already has an edge against Trump when it comes to national security. A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 56 percent of Americans believe she would be better at handling foreign policy, compared to 29 percent who thought Trump would be better. She also led Trump by 10 points on the question of who would be a better commander-in-chief. 
She noted that her tenure as secretary of state gives her the type of foreign policy experience Trump lacks, mentioning her work to advance agreements to fight climate change, a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, a nuclear weapons reduction deal with Russia and sanctions against Iran. She also pointed out that she was in the Situation Room with President Barack Obama debating whether to initiate the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. 
“I’m not new to this work, and I’m proud to run on my record, because I think the choice before the American people in this election is clear,” she said. “Making Donald Trump commander-in-chief would be a historic mistake.” 
Trump has attempted to walk back some of his past statements while simultaneously arguing that Clinton is misrepresenting them. On Wednesday, for instance, he claimed that he had never said Japan should have nuclear weapons, though he said exactly that, arguing that Japan would be better off if it had nuclear weapons to defend itself against North Korea. 
The reality television star and presumptive GOP nominee frequently calls Clinton's judgment into question by noting that she supported the United States’ invasion of Iraq and intervention in Libya, even though he supported both of those endeavors as well. His claim that he was prophetically opposed to the Iraq War “from the very beginning” has been thoroughly debunked by numerous news and fact-checking outlets.
Trump didn't respond substantively to Clinton's remarks, but tweeted that she didn't look presidential.
While Clinton’s speech made it seem like the general election has already begun, she is spending the next five days campaigning in California, where Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) threatens to embarrass her in what polling suggests is a tight race ahead of the state’s June 7 presidential primary.
Sanders said in a statement Thursday afternoon that while he agreed with Clinton that Trump's foreign policy ideas ""are incredibly reckless and irresponsible,"" he wanted to remind voters that Clinton voted for the war in Iraq, ""the worst foreign policy blunder in modern American history,"" and supported regime change in Libya, ""without thinking through the consequences."" 
""We need a foreign policy based on building coalitions and making certain that the brave American men and women in our military do not get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the Middle East,"" Sanders said. ""That's what I will fight for as president.""
Clinton is only about 70 delegates away from reaching the 2,383 she needs to secure the Democratic nomination, if one counts the pledged and super delegates already supporting her campaign.
 This story has been updated with a statement from Sen. Bernie Sanders.

639,POLITICS,A Former Medellin Cartel Official Has Been A DEA Informant For 27 Years. Now He Wants Out.,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/carlos-toro-dea-informant_n_7019466.html,"After a career on the front lines of the drug war, Carlos Toro is making the biggest gamble of his life.",2015-04-09,POLITICS,"Carlos Toro, seen at his Miami home in 1982, has been on both sides of the drug war, first as a Medellín cartel member and later as a confidential DEA informant. (Photo courtesy of Carlos Toro)
“You're lying to me,"" the man said. Carlos Toro took a gulp of wine and tried to maintain his composure. For years, he had dreaded hearing those words.
It was February 2011, and Toro, who was then 61, had come to this upscale steakhouse in Madrid expecting a casual meal between two friends with business to discuss. His companion was a South American diplomat and high-level cocaine trafficker eager to break into the European drug market, where a kilo purchased for less than $1,000 wholesale back home could sell for more than $40,000 on the street. Toro was a onetime top official in the Colombia-based Medellín cartel, which dominated the global cocaine market in the 1970s and '80s.
In his sharply tailored blazer and slacks, a shock of thinning, gray hair atop his head, Toro certainly looked the part of a high-rolling cartel boss. He made up for his short and slightly sagging frame with a confident, easygoing charm. He had offered to facilitate a partnership with a Spanish airline employee who could supposedly transport drugs between South America and Europe aboard commercial planes.
Over the previous two years, Toro and the diplomat had shared many dinners like this one. They had exchanged intimate details about their personal lives, and Toro had even met the man's young son. Everything Toro told him, though, had been a lie.
For well over two decades, Toro had been a confidential informant for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration -- and a very effective one at that. But now the diplomat had stumbled across a piece of incriminating evidence: Toro's airline contact wasn't real. When the diplomat analyzed their email correspondence, he discovered that the messages from Toro and the airline employee originated from the same IP address. If the airline contact really was a Spaniard living in Barcelona, why did he appear to be with Toro in the United States, sending emails from Toro's computer?
""What are you talking about?"" Toro replied, trying to sound confused. The man stood up. ""Who are you working for?"" he snarled. ""Are you working for the DEA?""
The restaurant seemed to come to a standstill, and Toro began to panic. Feigning outrage at the accusation, he stormed off to the bathroom and frantically called the U.S. embassy, hoping to reach his DEA handler.
But before Toro could get his supervisor on the line, someone grabbed his jacket collar. Toro turned and swung at his assailant's face. It was the diplomat, and the blow sent him staggering backwards to the floor. Just then, another patron walked in, preventing a brawl. Toro's target picked himself up, and they awkwardly returned to their table. 
The diplomat demanded to see Toro's cell phone. Knowing his call log would show his recent attempt to contact the DEA, Toro refused, challenging his companion to turn over his phone instead. When he did, Toro grabbed both phones, slammed them on the tile floor and stomped them to pieces. ""I don't trust you. I don't want to work with you. You doubted me. I don't have to do this. I came all the way from the United States to help you,"" he shouted. ""This is outrageous.""
Every customer and employee in the establishment was now following the commotion. People stood up, craning their necks to watch the drama unfold. Servers hurried over to defuse the situation. The diplomat, who had no desire for a spectacle, finally left the restaurant.
Toro apologized to the manager, paid the bill, cleaned up the shattered cell phones and headed for the exit. But before he reached the street, he hesitated. What would happen when he walked out the door? Was he about to be gunned down by a drive-by assassin -- or worse, tossed into a car trunk and taken off to be tortured?
Toro took a deep breath. It was after 1 a.m., and the lingering smell of grilled meat was now infused with the acrid odor of cleaning supplies. He pushed through the doors and found the diplomat waiting for him on a metal bench outside.
For a moment, Toro wondered if the diplomat was planning to pull the trigger himself. But his tantrum had apparently been effective. The man seemed almost apologetic, acknowledging that he may have overreacted. Perhaps the airline contact was actually the DEA snitch, he suggested.
Toro bid the diplomat a cold good-night and walked swiftly to his hotel, making sure he wasn't being followed. When he made contact with his DEA handler, he was ordered to extract immediately. Toro got on the first flight out of Madrid. Within a few hours, he had arrived safely in Lisbon.
Soon, he'd be back in the U.S., awaiting his next assignment.
Confidential informants are the lifeblood of the DEA, and Toro is what agents would characterize as a ""good asset."" He has served the DEA for 27 years. His intelligence-gathering has helped take down arms dealers, money launderers and narcotraffickers across the globe, including legendary figures such as Medellín cartel kingpin Carlos Lehder and Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. Toro testified against Noriega in federal court. And in 2010, the DEA, citing his contributions to those cases, gave him an award for lifetime achievement. He is one of the most productive DEA assets ever to come forward and tell his story.
Toro's escapades in narcotrafficking often sound fantastical. This is, after all, a man who regularly lies for a living. But Toro spoke to The Huffington Post extensively over the course of several months. He provided numerous documents to support his account, including emails, photos and DEA incident reports detailing the Madrid episode and others. The following story has been based largely on those sources. (The DEA denied repeated requests for comment and typically does not speak publicly about specific informants.)
For Toro, going public in this manner comes with obvious risks. But he feels that he has no other choice. Now 65, he has grown tired of facing down dangerous criminals. He is no longer in good health, too old to square off with would-be assassins or make quick getaways down darkened streets. He wants to retire and live out his remaining years with his family in the United States -- his wife of 35 years, Mariana; their son and daughter; a grandson. (The name of Toro's wife has been changed to protect her identity.)
The DEA, however, has a different idea. For the last five years, the agency has issued Toro a temporary immigration document that requires him to assist in active investigations. If he stops snitching, however, his immigration status will lapse. That could mean deportation to Colombia, Toro's country of birth, where he fears he'd be assassinated by the former cartel associates he once helped put behind bars.
In 2012, Alejandro Bernal Madrigal, a former member of the Medellín cartel, was murdered in Colombia just a month after returning home. He had served time in a U.S. prison for trafficking cocaine, but had bargained down his sentence in exchange for testimony against a top cartel financier. Colombian authorities believe it was a revenge killing.
To avoid a similar fate, Toro has asked the DEA to help him obtain U.S. citizenship or legal permanent residence, allowing him to avoid deportation and access the federal benefits he's paid into over the course of his life. But he said the DEA has refused to change the terms of their arrangement. For years, Toro told himself that this was a partnership of equals. Now, he's come to realize that despite his record of success and years of risking his life, to the DEA he is merely a useful idiot.
Toro's situation conforms to the experience of many other DEA informants, according to criminal justice experts and former agents. There are an estimated 4,000 such operatives working for the agency at any given time, according to a 2005 report by the Department of Justice. ""Sources make you or break you,"" said Finn Selander, a former DEA special agent and a member of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, which opposes the war on drugs. ""They are everything for an agent's career.""
According to former undercover agent Michael Levine, agents come under enormous pressure to obtain results, and they lean on their sources heavily. ""Agents are only interested in one thing, and that is numbers: What can you do for me? Who can you get for me? What kind of headlines can you get? What kind of cases? How far can I go with you?"" said Levine, who spent 25 years with the DEA. 
When a DEA agent has leverage over an informant, Selander said, ""for lack of a more politically correct way of saying it, you've got that person by the balls."" He added that agents often view their sources as ""dirtbags"" and have no qualms about exploiting them. 
It's a situation in which the government holds all the cards, said Alexandra Natapoff, a professor at Loyola Law School and an expert on informants in the criminal justice system. ""If you've committed a crime, then you're on your own,"" she said. Agents may benefit greatly from a source's information, but there are no legal protections for the informants themselves. In dealings with the federal government, Natapoff said, ""those individuals often fare very badly.""

Toro was on his cell phone when he opened the door to his Washington, D.C., hotel room on an overcast January afternoon and ushered me in. ""DEA,"" he whispered loudly, pointing to his phone. He placed it on the desk and switched on the speaker, as if to show me there was actually someone on the other end.
When he finished the call, Toro extended his hand, flashing a disarming smile. He had flown in earlier that morning to tell me his life story in person. He was dressed in a blue zip-up sweater and skinny jeans -- an outfit he jokingly referred to as his ""drug dealer clothes."" Over the next three-and-a-half hours, he paced the slate gray carpet almost maniacally as he painted a detailed portrait of his life. He spoke quickly and assuredly, often without pause -- a regular habit of his. It was easy to see how he had made a career out of getting people to trust him.
Toro was born in 1949 in the city of Armenia, in the heart of the coffee-growing Andes region of Colombia. His family was wealthy. His father had been a pioneer in the broadcasting business, founding one of the nation's first private radio stations.
As a child, Toro recalled, he developed a close relationship with a family friend named Carlos Lehder. They were born just days apart, but shared little in terms of personality. Lehder was a rebellious youth who would go on to become one of the most powerful members of the Medellín cartel. Toro was personable and loyal but always more reserved, a trait he said was a function of his Christian upbringing. As a child, Lehder lived with Toro's family for a few months. In the mid-1960s, however, he left for the United States with his mother.
Toro also traveled to the U.S. in 1967 to attend high school in Hartford, Connecticut, where he could learn English and get an American education. He attended Emerson College in Boston, and during the summers toured with Campus Crusade for Christ and interned for Pat Robertson and the Christian Broadcasting Network. He eventually left school to join CBN and travel the world as a cameraman, before moving to New York in the mid-1970s.
Back in the U.S., Lehder took every opportunity to try to lure his friend away from the straight-and-narrow lifestyle. Toro recalled meeting with Lehder on several occasions, including at two separate parties at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York. In 1978, as America’s cocaine binge was in full swing, he visited Lehder in the hotel's presidential suite.
""He's got 20 prostitutes, there's a kilo of cocaine on the center table, and a bunch of friends and everybody is having a party,"" Toro said. ""We were there for three days, I don't even know.""
Lehder explained to Toro his grand vision for a new Colombia, controlled by the cartel and its ever-expanding cocaine empire. Lehder was on top of the world, making $2 million a week and entertaining foreign dignitaries, prime ministers and presidents. He'd even bought an island in the Bahamas, which the cartel would soon be using as a staging ground for cocaine shipments into the States.
Toro visited the Caribbean compound a few times a year in the late '70s and described it as an enclave overflowing with sex and drugs, guarded by a small army of men with Uzi submachine guns and packs of attack dogs. Each time he'd go, Lehder would insist that Toro join the cartel, but Toro remained wary of his friend's criminal enterprises.
In 1980, Toro married Mariana, a Colombian-American born and raised in Miami. Their first child was born in 1981. Shortly thereafter, the family moved from New York to Tamarac, Florida, where Toro managed a janitorial services company. Yet he couldn't deny that he was drawn to the perks of working for the cartel.
One day in 1983, Alvaro Triana, another childhood friend then in charge of the cartel's finances in Florida, showed up with an offer from Lehder. ""You will never, never be exposed to the drugs. You'll never touch the drugs. We need you as a PR man. You're the perfect person to do public relations,"" Toro recalled being told by Triana, a bulbous man with a mop of curly red hair and a fondness for whiskey. ""We're having problems finding landing strips to refuel our airplanes, recruiting pilots, training pilots, buying airplanes, repairing airplanes.""
The offer would bring Toro a fortune -- and all, he convinced himself, without having to get his hands dirty. Still, Toro didn't want to tell his wife he was getting involved in the cocaine trade that was then terrorizing large swaths of South Florida. Instead, he claimed that they were setting up a scheme to sell contraband luxury French goods, like perfume and lingerie. He said they would have both legal and physical protection, and that they would be moved into a brand-new, villa-style home in Boca Raton and given whatever kind of car they wanted to drive. Toro took a sabbatical from his cleaning business, and within a few weeks, he was working for the cartel.
Over the next few years, Toro's role in the organization expanded. He coordinated logistics for cocaine smuggling operations, arranging flight paths, cutting deals with foreign leaders and paying pilots and couriers. (Years later, he described his responsibilities and the internal workings of the Medellín cartel in a 2000 interview with PBS's ""Frontline."")
Throughout the mid-'80s, Toro regularly saw $10 million a week flow through the attic of his home. He also purchased a .38-caliber revolver, which he carried under his jacket.
One day while Toro was out, Mariana unzipped one of the army-green duffel bags lying on the attic floor. It was full of rubber-banded rolls of hundred-dollar bills -- a total of $1.2 million in cash. Mariana had suspected her husband was involved in something more serious than selling stolen Chanel No. 5. When she confronted him, he promised the work was only temporary.
Toro claims the situation left him desensitized to wealth. He was being paid handsomely and everything he could want was at his fingertips, so he never felt the need to save. He had planned to retire after a couple of years but never put money aside, unwisely assuming it would always be available to him.
Respect for the chain of command was a central tenet of the Medellín cartel. So in 1985, when Toro found out that Triana wasn't paying pilots on time, he was faced with a hard decision: go over Triana’s head or risk losing key links in their supply chain. Toro decided to make sure the pilots were paid immediately. He contacted the cartel's financial backers in Colombia, who gave him $7 million to distribute. It was the latest episode in an already escalating feud between Toro and Triana, and perhaps Toro should have known better. Triana was volatile, insecure and impulsive -- not the sort of man you wanted to antagonize.
The next afternoon, Triana showed up at Toro's house looking disheveled and cradling a nearly empty bottle of whiskey. ""Come out, you son of a bitch,"" Toro remembered Triana yelling from his front yard. Triana continued to hurl insults at Toro as they took the argument down the street to Triana's house. In the living room, Triana sank into a recliner and gave Toro an ultimatum: He had 24 hours to leave the Boca Raton house and return the cartel's property.
Toro accused Triana of stealing the money meant for the pilots and threatened to go to the cartel bosses with the allegation. Triana exploded. ""I'm gonna kill you!"" he screamed, reaching down and pulling an Uzi from beneath his armchair. Toro grabbed his revolver and fired three times, hitting Triana in the chin and the groin and sending him slumping to the floor. The third shot hit the ceiling. ""I don't know how I did it,"" Toro recalled. ""I wasn't looking.""
Triana was alive and conscious but losing blood fast. The hospital was out of the question: Triana was living in the U.S. under a fake identity. Taking him to the emergency room would have put the entire Florida-based cartel operation in jeopardy. Toro called a former business partner and asked him to send over his son, a medical student. The young man dressed Triana's wounds and gave him a morphine injection, while Toro tracked down a cartel pilot to fly Triana back to Colombia for more extensive treatment. In the middle of the night, Triana was loaded onto a small plane and secreted out of the country.
Toro called Lehder to tell him what had happened, expecting that his old friend would understand. ""You shot one of my men?"" Toro remembered Lehder saying. ""You're dead.""
As a DEA informant, Toro (center, in the 1980s) gathered intelligence that helped take down such legendary figures as cartel kingpin Carlos Lehder (left) and Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega (right). (Lehder and Noriega photos: AP; Toro photo courtesy of Carlos Toro) 
Toro and his family fled back to Tamarac. One morning a few months later, the cartel apparently caught up with him. In a parking lot a few miles from his house, police discovered the body of a young woman, a small-time cocaine dealer Toro had known, in the trunk of a car. She had been stabbed more than 15 times, and her head had been cut off. Toro said he believes she was killed by a cartel hit man and dumped near his house to frame him.
Police arrested Toro for the murder, but with no real evidence to link him to the girl's death, the charges were dismissed. During his 12-hour interrogation, however, Toro let slip that he'd helped the Medellín cartel buy fuel for its planes. That gave the local district attorney a charge that could stick: conspiracy to traffic cocaine. If convicted, Toro would face a 15-year mandatory minimum prison sentence.
Convincing a jury of his innocence seemed like a long shot. Toro had in fact been a party to a massive criminal enterprise. It didn't help that the drug violence sweeping Florida had made many people suspicious of Colombians. An innocent Colombian stood little chance in front of a Florida jury at that time. A guilty one with a taped confession had even less.
Toro's lawyer brokered an alternative: Toro could become an informant for the DEA. If he provided substantial assistance to the agency within 90 days, he could plead no contest to the conspiracy charge and remain a free man, with his criminal record sealed. 
If Toro didn't already have a price on his head, he knew that working for the feds would surely earn him one. But 15 years in prison would have meant losing his family, including his two young children. It also didn't hurt that the deal would allow him to exact revenge on his former cartel associates who had turned their backs on him.
Toro's first order of business was to begin identifying cartel assets -- account numbers, stash houses, residences, banks and other properties that had been used to facilitate their drug operation. His handler was Michael McManus, a young, ambitious DEA special agent cutting his teeth in the drug war then raging in Florida. Toro was productive, and when his three months of service were up, he could have walked away from the DEA for good. In hindsight, he should have. Instead, he made a decision that would define the rest of his life.
""Deep inside, I felt that the more I contributed to the DEA, the more the government would appreciate what I do, and I could re-establish my life as a private citizen,"" Toro said, taking a break from his patrolling of the hotel room to sit on the bed across from me. ""I knew I screwed up, and I felt the need to atone and pay back, and to this day I feel that way.""
Toro agreed to expand his role with the DEA and became drawn, almost obsessively, to the work. Going undercover provided many of the same things that had led him to join the cartel: an adrenaline rush, a lavish lifestyle, a feeling of importance.
""It's fun to be a drug dealer with a permit -- to be a drug dealer legally,"" Toro said. ""I leave my humble apartment in Miami to go the next day and sleep at the presidential suite in Paris in a Hyatt, and I go and rent a car that costs me $800 a day to drive around Paris, and I have a watch that is a $5,000 Rolex.""
Over the next few years, Toro contributed intelligence to investigations that would eventually lead to the arrests and extraditions of Lehder in 1987 and Triana in 1988, as well as a number of other cartel members and their allies in the U.S., the Caribbean and Latin America. As rumors of Toro's involvement in these cases trickled back to Colombia, he became a pariah in his country of birth, and his relatives received death threats. Toro, Mariana and their children spent almost two years in the Witness Protection Program, living in the U.S. under assumed identities, moving from city to city to prevent possible exposure. Tired of the constant upheaval, Toro and his family voluntarily left the program in 1988, against the advice of his supervisors.
When not pursuing cases, Toro took a number of civilian jobs to supplement his wife's income as a medical assistant. Over the years, he scanned mail for the U.S. Postal Service, sold appliances at Sears, handled credit and collections for Microsoft, worked as a repo man for Ford and translated for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The lure of his DEA gigs -- for which he was paid only minimally -- always superseded his other commitments, however, and his family suffered as a result. ""Financial instability defined our lives,"" Toro's son, now 30, told The Huffington Post. 
Mariana said that the DEA knew it had effective control over her husband and didn't hesitate to take advantage of it. ""Carlos would find a job and he gets into the rhythm of having regular employment, and then the DEA would entice him with this thing that by his nature he likes,"" Mariana said. ""In my mind he likes that adrenaline, that dual persona -- that persona that lies within him. He doesn't want to be the 9-to-5 and the boring life and the mundane -- he doesn't want that. A lot of times he took the jobs for that reason, because he got bored.""

By 2006, the adrenaline rush was starting to wear off. Toro was 56 years old, and he'd spent the past two decades at the beck and call of the DEA. With an eye on retirement, he took a job in Costa Rica as a credit and collections manager with Hewlett Packard. He and Mariana traveled there together. He saw the two-and-a-half year contract as a chance to finally step away from DEA work and ease their money troubles.
Less than a year later, however, Toro flew to Chicago to attend a work conference. As he went through passport control at O'Hare International Airport, security stopped him and took him to a room for a secondary inspection. With the passage of the Patriot Act, any known member of a drug cartel was classified as a terrorist. Toro's criminal record had been unsealed, and he had been declared inadmissible -- never again permitted back into the country.
""The agent told me I had two choices,"" Toro recalled. ""You leave the country today under your own will to the country of origin, to Costa Rica -- you pay for your ticket -- or we have to take you into custody and you'll go through deportation hearings and you'll be shipped to Colombia. I knew I couldn't go to Colombia, because I'd be dead.""
Distraught, Toro returned to Costa Rica. When his contract with Hewlett Packard expired in 2009, he was given 30 days to vacate the country. Now he was a man without a home. Toro still couldn't believe he was being locked out of the U.S., a nation he'd lived in and served for so long.
The DEA finally offered him a lifeline, asking him to gather intelligence on a drug-trafficking scheme in South America. Toro dusted off his second identity as a drug trafficker and moved to a new base in Peru.
""I thought, 'If I go back to DEA, this will be solved. I'll be able to come back to the United States very soon,'"" Toro said. ""It sounded so simple that after working for a few months they would reverse the inadmissibility or that they would make an exception, because it didn't make sense that I wouldn't be admitted to a country that I worked for.""
But relief came only when one of Toro's targets summoned him to an important meeting in the U.S., forcing the DEA to devise a solution. In 2010, Toro re-entered the country for the first time in nearly four years with an I-512 form that granted him legal status for a year, contingent upon his continued service to the federal government. (Toro provided a copy of his most recent I-512 forms to The Huffington Post.) He moved back in with his wife, where he could be close to his son and grandson.
Now, the DEA's control over Toro was complete. Every three months, the Department of Homeland Security would conduct an audit to make sure he was still active in an investigation, and the DEA would assess his productivity annually before sponsoring him for another year. If the agency determined he was no longer valuable, his immigration status would be revoked and he could be deported to Colombia.
This type of exploitation is standard practice in the DEA and other law enforcement agencies, according to former agents and criminal justice experts. An informant's immigration status is particularly easy to take advantage of. ""The leverage the immigration status gives the government is immense,"" said Loyola Law’s Natapoff, ""so we have seen in recent years more stories coming to light of the government using that leverage in ways that really do hang informants out to dry.""
Levine, the former undercover DEA agent, said it's extremely common for informants like Toro to feel that they've been abused by the process, sometimes rightly and sometimes wrongly. But he also suggested that Toro was foolish to assume any amount of hard work and dedication could earn him special treatment. ""Once you get caught up in that world, you're on your own. The rule is that there are no rules,"" he said. ""That's a dirty, wormy, rat-eat-rat world.""
In March 2014, Toro finally had a wake-up call. Then 64, he was told by an oncologist in Miami that he needed immediate surgery to remove a baseball-sized tumor from his prostate -- a $5,000 procedure. Toro had no savings, no benefits and no health insurance. “I told the DEA, and they said, 'Sorry, we can't help you.' I was dying and they didn't care,"" Toro said. He claimed that a DEA contact even told him at one point to ""stop whining.""
Toro turned to McManus, the man who had first brought him to the DEA nearly 30 years earlier. Propelled in part by the successful cases he'd worked with Toro, McManus had moved up the ranks of the agency, eventually becoming chief of operations for Mexico and Central America before retiring in 2004. In one of the highlights of his career, he took down George Jung, the drug trafficker portrayed by Johnny Depp in the 2001 film ""Blow."" He is now a highly sought-after public speaker and an unofficial spokesman for the DEA. 
When Toro reached out to him, McManus lent him the $5,000. McManus denied requests for comment.

Today, Toro lives with his wife in a small one-bedroom apartment. Mariana supports both of them on her modest salary as an administrator at a medical supply company. Without legal status, Toro can't get a job or health insurance. He has no pension and no way to contribute to the rent. When his driver's license expires later this year, he has no way to legally renew it.
""Many people got promoted because of what my husband did,"" Mariana said. ""What did Carlos get out of it? What did my family get out of it?""
In 2010, the U.S. government gave Toro a ""lifetime achievement"" award and a check for $80,000 -- about $3,000 for each year of work. It was the only significant money he ever made as an informant. But what Toro really wants is a permanent resolution to his immigration problems and an end to his DEA servitude.
With the government's support, Toro could secure a visa or green card. That would allow him to eventually apply for Medicare and retire in the U.S. with the Social Security benefits he has earned over his years as a civilian employee. 
In effect, he is asking the DEA to do the right thing. But while Toro claimed he's been treated well by some agents over the years, Natapoff said the overall relationship between the DEA and its informants is not based on fairness. ""The whole world of informant use is built on fuzzy ethics, the toleration of hypocrisy, inequitable treatment and often coercion,"" she said. ""So that is a tricky world to ask people to do the right thing.""
Toro said the DEA recently warned him against going public with his story and claimed the agency would get him a visa, eventually. But the agency's process could take years, and he would still be required to work as an informant. At his age and with his health continuing to decline, he said he can't continue to wait indefinitely or jet around the globe chasing bad guys. He simply wants out of the devil's bargain he made with the DEA some three decades ago.
""I am not denying that I was at fault by working for the cartel,"" Toro said. “I feel not that I deserve a medal, not that I should be compensated with money ... but that I should be recognized only as a human being who has made a huge mistake, and that I made it up over and over and over.""

Greenberg, Scholar in Residence at The Daniel Gould Center of Conflict Resolution at Stanford Law School. ****************************************** 1.Ten weeks ago, in early October, as war crimes and mass atrocities against civilians in Aleppo intensified, humanitarian organizations and individuals of conscience called out in warning.  A global coalition of 223 civil society organizations, including Amnesty International, Care International, Human Rights Watch, International Rescue Committee, Oxfam, Physicians for Human Rights, Save the Children, and the Syrian Relief Network issued a joint statement:
""The UN Security Council has failed Syrians. In almost six years of conflict, close to half a million people have been killed and eleven million have been forced to leave their homes. Most recently, the Syrian and Russian governments and their allies have carried out unlawful attacks on eastern Aleppo with scant regard for some 250,000 civilians trapped there. Armed opposition groups have also fired mortars and other projectiles into civilian neighbourhoods of western Aleppo, though according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 'indiscriminate airstrikes across the eastern part of the city by Government forces and their allies are responsible for the overwhelming majority of civilian casualties.' Efforts to stop these atrocities and hold those responsible to account have been blocked repeatedly by Russia, which continues to misuse its veto power in the Security Council.""
The organizations ""urgently call upon UN member states to step in and request an Emergency Special Session of the UN General Assembly to demand an end to all unlawful attacks in Aleppo and elsewhere in Syria, and immediate and unhindered humanitarian access so that life-saving aid can reach all those in need."" https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/12/01/uniting-peace-syria-global-civil-society-appeal-un-member-states
Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy for Syria, warned that ""the whole of eastern Aleppo could be destroyed by Christmas if the 'cruel, constant' Russian-backed bombing continues."" The scale of human tragedy in the besieged areas of Aleppo was already overwhelming, and it could become much worse. He called on the world to avert ""another Srebrenica, another Rwanda."" https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/06/aleppo-could-be-destroyed-by-christmas-warns-un-envoy-for-syria Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights, condemned the slaughter, and demanded accountability from its perpetrators.
He said that ""crimes of historic proportions"" were committed, and that """"Indiscriminate airstrikes across the eastern part of the city by government forces and their allies are responsible for the overwhelming majority of civilian casualties."" http://www.npr.org/2016/12/17/505893462/they-said-never-again Specifically, Zeid called for Russia and Syria to be charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity, including the bombardment of civilians in Aleppo. A referral to the International Criminal Court, he said, ""would be more than justified given the rampant and deeply shocking impunity that has characterized the conflict and the magnitude of the crimes that have been committed..."" 
As reported by Reuters, ""Zeid said Syria's government and its allies attacked targets protected by international law, including medical units, aid workers and water-pumping stations. He said that dropping indiscriminate incendiary weapons in heavily populated areas was particularly concerning, as well as being banned by a treaty that Russia is bound by. He compared Aleppo to the World War Two battles of Warsaw and Stalingrad and the attack on Dresden, and said calling the enemy a 'terrorist organization' was not an excuse to ignore the laws of war."" http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-zeid-idUSKCN1240RU
Religious figures also spoke out, including the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. ""What is being done is evil both in the strict theological sense and in the general sense. It is demonic. It's the absolute contempt for the human spirit. For the dignity of the human being. It's the brushing aside of the poor and the weak and the fragile in a way that is as bad as anything we've seen in the last century. It compares with some of the great atrocities of the last century. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/violence-aleppo-demonic-archbishop-of-canterbury-syria-rome-justin-welby-a7349606.html
Dr. Ahmad Tarakji, President of the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) said, ""It is important to face down the worst of humanity, look it straight in the eyes and refuse to blink. But we are closing our eyes to what is happening in Aleppo. If we are to not act now in the face of such depravity and disregard for basic norms - when will we ever?"" https://www.savethechildren.net/article/un-general-assembly-must-urgently-unite-peace-syria-humanitarian-catastrophe-unfolds-aleppo
British MP Andrew Mitchell spoke out, on the floor of the House of Commons: ""What Russia is doing to the United Nations is precisely what Italy and Germany did to the League of Nations in the 1930s. And they are doing to Aleppo precisely what the Nazis did to Guernica in the Spanish civil war."" https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/oct/12/picasso-guernica-aleppo-syria U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry put it simply: ""The Assad regime is actually carrying out nothing short of a massacre."" http://www.npr.org/2016/12/17/505893462/they-said-never-again
2.Clarifying the analogies:
Human beings use historical analogies to help us understand that world-historical events are taking place in the present moment; to help us comprehend the significance and meaning of these events in a deeper context; to help us assess more accurately their moral gravity; and to help us find the correct political and ethical response.
There are three sets of analogies here. It is important to differentiate them, and reflect on each. 
The first set refers to aggression by Italy and Germany in the 1930s - including the 1935 Italian invasion of Abyssinia (Ethiopia), Hitler's 1936 military occupation of the Rhineland in 1936, the German and Italian intervention to support Franco against the republicans in the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), and Hitler's occupation of the Czech Sudetenland in 1938 and the entire nation of Czechoslovakia the following year -- and the failure of the League of Nations to take action to prevent these illegal and grave violations of international peace and stability, or to punish Italy and Germany after those violations occurred. Blame for this failure can be assigned to the League's member states, especially Britain and France and its leaders, whose cowardice in the face of criminal aggression was clothed in the rhetoric of ""non-intervention."" But the greatest blame for this failure must be assigned to the United States. This is because the U.S. Senate, under the control of an ""anti-globalist"" Republican party, refused even to join the League, thus ensuring its fatal weakness. 
The second set of historical analogies - Guernica, Warsaw, Stalingrad, Dresden - refers to the indiscriminate aerial bombardment of civilian populations in urban areas, an atrocity and crime of war. Dresden is included in this list, as it should be. We must not forget that the United States and the U.K. perpetrated mass murder from the air during World War II no less than the Axis powers, culminating in the fire-bombing of Tokyo and the use of nuclear weapons on civilian populations in Japanese cities. Each military force conducted indiscriminate bombing of enemy civilians, a category of war crime that was deliberately left out of the Nuremberg charter to ensure that no decision-maker, neither from Nazi Germany nor from any Allied power, would be held accountable.
Nevertheless, we remember. 
We remember Tokyo, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We remember that the U.S. dropped a far greater tonnage of explosives in Indochina from 1964 to 1973 than during all of World War II, including over 2 million tons of ordnance over Laos in 580,000 bombing missions -- the equivalent of one planeload every 8 minutes, 24 hours a day, for 9 years - and least 270 million cluster bomblets, killing 50,000 Laotians since 1964 (and 20,000 since 1973, after the war ended). http://legaciesofwar.org/resources/cluster-bomb-fact-sheet/
We remember the 1937 bombing Guernica because one individual, Pablo Picasso, indelibly portrayed the abject criminality of the German Luftwaffe and the Italian fascist Aviazione Legionaria in human terms. Poland can never forget the 1939 and 1944 bombing raids by the Luftwaffe on Warsaw, leveling the city and killing many thousands of its inhabitants. Hundreds of bombing sorties by the Luftwaffe over Stalingrad, combined with relentless attacks by Nazi troops in the city's streets, killed more than a million Russians there. Annihilation of civilian populations was not a collateral effect of Hitler's policy. Annihilation was Hitler's policy. 
In January 2016, in a press conference in which he stood next to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced Russian policy in Syria: ""to fight them until their complete annihilation."" https://www.rt.com/news/329591-syria-isis-lavrov-kerry/ Mr. Lavrov was referring specifically to ISIS and the Nusra Front. But the Russians were less nuanced and deceptive in subsequent months, as they prepared for the final onslaught on Aleppo's civilian neighborhoods. As described in an October 26 statement to the United Nations Security Council by Stephen O'Brien, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs:
""The leaflets which have been dropped on eastern Aleppo by Syrian and Russian aircrafts operating in that area make the intention chillingly clear. They read 'This is your last hope.... Save yourselves. If you do not leave these areas urgently, you will be annihilated' and they end by saying 'You know that everyone has given up on you. They left you alone to face your doom and nobody will give you any help'. And it is clear that the aircraft which drop the bombs, the generals who give the orders and the politicians who have designed the strategy intend to make good on that horrific promise.""
As indeed they have done.
The third set of analogies includes Srebrenica and Rwanda. In these places mass murder was committed in cold blood. Executions were carried out by bullets to the head in the first case, and machetes in the second, while the international community watched and did nothing. According to the UN Human Rights Office, civilians in Aleppo were killed in summary executions as Syrian and Russian soldiers and mercenaries went house to house in the final phase of Assad's offensive against the besieged city. How many Russians took part in these executions? We don't know the answer. According to a Wall Street Journal news report published on December 16 (""Russian Special Forces Seen as Key to Aleppo Victory"") reports: ""On Sunday, the weekly state news program Vesti Nedeli offered a rare glimpse of Russians in combat, airing footage of Russian special operators in Syria. ""Russian special forces have been in Aleppo for a number of weeks, where they've taken on a combat role,"" said Ruslan Pukhov, the head of Moscow-based defense think tank CAST."" http://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-special-forces-seen-as-key-to-aleppo-victory-1481884200 In addition to the men, women and children killed by Russian bombs, how many civilians were slaughtered by Syrian and Russian militias? We don't know the answer to this question either.
A week ago, UN published evidence of at least 82 victims, but the killings have continued and perhaps escalated over in the subsequent days. http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=21024&LangID=E#sthash.KMWaL70K.dpuf Whatever the number, these people were executed in cold blood.
Yesterday the UN envoy to Syria estimated that 50,000 men, women and children remain in eastern Aleppo. David Milliband, President of the International Rescue Committee, warned that these civilians face ""sheer terror. And that is the only way to describe this because people are fleeing from appalling bombardment, and house-to-house murder that's being documented by the UN, and they don't know if it's going to follow them from Aleppo to Idlib [the Syrian city to which refugees from Aleppo are fleeing]."" http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/aleppo-syria-civilians-massacre-assad-david-miliband-a7481241.html
In retrospect, UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura was correct in his assessment ten weeks ago: the annihilation of Aleppo was accomplished before Christmas. The UN Human Rights Commissioner's call for a referral to the International Criminal Court to investigate and prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity has gone unheeded - because Russia has a veto power over any such referral. For the same reason the Security Council has been neutered. The Russians have been proven correct: civilians trapped in Aleppo were annihilated, as promised, and their assessment of the world's response was also vindicated. Everyone gave up on them, leaving them alone to face their doom, ""and nobody will give you any help."" Three days ago Syrian President Assad appeared on state television to celebrate the ""liberation"" of Aleppo. ""Driving the last 'terrorists' out was 'history in the making', and 'greater than the word 'congratulations', he said."" http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/aleppo-conflict-assad-ceasefire-syria-civil-war-a7477491.html
Will we remember the Aleppo as we remember Guernica? Thus far we don't have a 21st century Picasso to capture the victims' agony in a way that captures the world's moral imagination with comparable force. The brushing aside of the poor and the weak and the fragile continues unabated, in Syria and throughout the world. Millions of Syrian refugees and internally displaced men, women and children have been abandoned.
The U.S. President-elect has promised to prevent any of them from finding refuge in our country, no matter what our obligations under international law. In a recent interview on Russian media, in the wake of Aleppo's destruction, Syrian President Bashir Assad said that Donald Trump will be a ""naturally ally"" of his regime, and Putin's - presuming that he acts according to pronouncements he made during the campaign. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/syria-bashar-al-assad-donald-trump-russias-natural-ally-putin-a7474786.html
According to analysis in the November 15, 2016 Washington Post: ""Assad's government is exulting over Trump's election because of his pledges to join forces with Russia against the Islamic State and Syrian rebels, according to Bassam Abu Abdullah, a professor at Damascus University who supports Assad. The expectation in Damascus now is that Washington will sever support for Syrian rebels, join in bombing them alongside Russia and perhaps restore diplomatic relations with Assad, he said.""
We pray that President Assad and Professor Bassam Abu Abdullah are incorrect in their predictions.
3.The silence of the good people: the ""wintertime soldiers of conscience"". Of course we will never forget the famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech delivered by Martin Luther King, Jr. in front of the Lincoln Memorial on August 28, 1963, at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. But it is the speech delivered just before King's speech that haunts us most powerfully to this day. It was given by Rabbi Joachim Prinz, and this is the paragraph we remember most:
""When I was the rabbi of the Jewish community in Berlin under the Hitler regime, I learned many things. The most important thing that I learned under those tragic circumstances was that bigotry and hatred are not the most urgent problem. The most urgent, the most disgraceful, the most shameful and the most tragic problem is silence. A great people which had created a great civilization had become a nation of silent onlookers. They remained silent in the face of hate, in the face of brutality and in the face of mass murder. America must not become a nation of onlookers. America must not remain silent."" http://www.joachimprinz.com/civilrights.htm
Rabbi Prinz was speaking directly about the persistence of Jim Crow segregation throughout the former Confederate states. But his warning has a far deeper resonance. 
His call to conscience demands that we remember Dresden as we remember Guernica. We must remember Srebrenica, and we must also remember instances when U.S. forces perpetrated mass murder against foreign civilians. On April 23, 1971, three years after Rabbi Prinz's plea at the March on Washington, a young Vietnam veteran could no longer remain silent about what he had witnessed and experienced during his service overseas. In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he spoke out in protest against the moral atrocities perpetrated against civilians in that war, and against silence of good Americans in the face of war crimes committed in their name. The name of the veteran was John Kerry. Here is an excerpt from his testimony on that day:
""I would like to talk on behalf of all those veterans and say that several months ago in Detroit we had an investigation at which over 150 honorably discharged, and many very highly decorated, veterans testified to war crimes committed in Southeast Asia. These were not isolated incidents but crimes committed on a day-to-day basis with the full awareness of officers at all levels of command. It is impossible to describe to you exactly what did happen in Detroit - the emotions in the room and the feelings of the men who were reliving their experiences in Vietnam. They relived the absolute horror of what this country, in a sense, made them do.""
""They told stories that at times they had personally raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages in fashion reminiscent of Ghengis Khan, shot cattle and dogs for fun, poisoned food stocks, and generally ravaged the countryside of South Vietnam in addition to the normal ravage of war and the normal and very particular ravaging which is done by the applied bombing power of this country.""
""We call this investigation the Winter Soldier Investigation. The term Winter Soldier is a play on words of Thomas Paine's in 1776 when he spoke of the Sunshine Patriots and summertime soldiers who deserted at Valley Forge because the going was rough.""
""We who have come here to Washington have come here because we feel we have to be winter soldiers now. We could come back to this country, we could be quiet, we could hold our silence, we could not tell what went on in Vietnam, but we feel because of what threatens this country, not the reds, but the crimes which we are committing that threaten it, that we have to speak out...."" http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/sixties/HTML_docs/Resources/Primary/Manifestos/VVAW_Kerry_Senate.htm l The most terrible such crime was the massacre by U.S. troops of Vietnamese women and children in the hamlet of My Lai, South Vietnam. Calley was prosecuted, convicted and released before his sentence had been completed. But his superior officers were never held accountable for creating the environment in which Calley's actions were understood to be permissible. 
4.Facing down evil We were reminded of the My Lai massacre yesterday when we read the New York Times obituary of Larry Colburn, a Vietnam-era veteran and American hero who died earlier this past week. According to the Times, ""Colburn, was the last surviving member of a three-man helicopter crew that was ordered to hover over My Lai on Saturday morning, March 16, 1968, to identify enemy positions by drawing Vietcong fire."" But there was no enemy fire, because there were no Vietcong soldiers in the hamlet. Only women and children, shot in cold blood or being herded into an irrigation ditch to be executed there. Colburn and his colleagues watched from above as their fellow platoon members systematically murdered the villagers. 
In a 2010 PBS interview, Colburn described what happened next. Hugh Thompson, the helicopter pilot, notified his superiors. ""[Thompson] got on the radio and just said, 'This isn't right, these are civilians, there's people killing civilians down here."" But Thompson's superior officers didn't care. ""And that's when he decided to intervene. He said, 'We've got to do something about this, are you with me?' And we said, 'Yes.'"" 
The Times obituary continues: 
""Mr. Thompson confronted the officer in command of the rampaging platoon, Lt. William L. Calley, but was rebuffed. He then positioned the helicopter between the troops and the surviving villagers and faced off against another lieutenant. Mr. Thompson ordered Mr. Colburn to fire his M-60 machine gun at any soldiers who tried to inflict further harm.
""'Y'all cover me!"" Mr. Thompson was quoted as saying. ""If these bastards open up on me or these people, you open up on them. Promise me!'""
""'You got it boss,' Mr. Colburn replied. 'Consider it done.'"" 
""Mr. Thompson, Mr. Colburn and Glenn Andreotta, the copter's crew chief, found about 10 villagers cowering in a makeshift bomb shelter and coaxed them out, then had them flown to safety by two Huey gunships. They found an 8-year old boy clinging to his mother's corpse in an irrigation ditch and plucked him by the back of his shirt and delivered him to a nun in a nearby hospital.
""Crucially, they reported what they had witnessed to headquarters, which ordered a cease-fire. By then, as many as 500 villagers had been killed...
""In 1998, thirty years after the massacre, Mr. Thompson and Mr. Colburn were awarded the Soldier's Medal, which is granted for life-saving bravery not involving direct contact with an enemy.
""'It is my solemn wish that we all never forget the tragedy and brutality of war,' Mr. Colburn said at the ceremony, held at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. 'I would like to quote Gen. Douglas MacArthur: 'The soldier, be he friend or foe, is charged with the protection of the weak and the unarmed. It is his very existence for being.'
""... The two men returned to My Lai that year, meeting some of the villagers they had rescued and dedicating an elementary school. On the flight home, Mr. Colburn recalled, he turned to Mr. Thompson and said, 'It was so good to see all those little kids smiling again, not having to worry about being blown up, not having to look over their shoulders all the time, just being able to be kids.'
""Mr. Thompson died of cancer in 2006 at 62.
Two years later, on the 40th anniversary of the massacre, Mr. Colburn returned to Vietnam and was reunited with Do Ba, who as a boy had been rescued by Mr. Colburn from an irrigation ditch.""
Lest we forget: Morality and Conscience reminds us that ""WE are the ones we've been waiting for""!

641,POLITICS,Friday Talking Points -- Selenofriggatriskaidekaphobics Unite!,"Chris Weigant, ContributorPolitical writer and blogger at ChrisWeigant.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/friday-talking-points_b_5493984.html,"Iraq is self-destructing. This led the Wall Street Journal to call for a few airstrikes and some American paratroopers to fix the problem, because we all know how well that turned out the last time, right?",2014-06-14,POLITICS,"I have to begin this week by apologizing for the irreverent nature of that title, but then how often do you get a chance to coin a cool word like ""selenofriggatriskaidekaphobia""? 
The proper answer is that the chance won't come again until 2049, which explains why we couldn't resist. The word is a mashup of two phobias, the fear of a full moon (selenophobia) and the fear of Friday the 13th (friggatriskaidekaphobia, not to be confused with fear of the number 13, which is just triskaidekaphobia, of course). The rare occurrence of a full moon on a Friday the 13th won't happen again for another 35 years, so today's pretty much it for this generation of selenofriggatriskaidekaphobics, at least. But enough of this looney etymological fun, let's get on with a week chock-full of political happenings, shall we?
Hillary Clinton apparently has a new book out, as anyone within sight of a television learned this week. This would have been the big story this week, except a whole bunch of other stuff happened which overshadowed Hillary's book tour. By week's end, the Clinton news had even moved on to astonishment that Chelsea Clinton was being paid a whopping $600,000 a year to produce the occasional puff piece for NBC News. Nice work, if you can get it, eh?
Another story which faded fast was the Bowe Bergdahl saga, even though his girlfriend released his handwritten journals to the Washington Post, which gave a glimpse inside his troubled mind.
An amendment to weaken ""trucker fatigue"" standards for professional truck drivers was debated in the Senate, mere days before Tracy Morgan's limo was hit by a trucker who had reportedly been awake for more than 24 hours. This was indeed an ironic twist of fate, but we refuse to make cheap jokes about an accident which killed one of Morgan's friends.
The Drug Enforcement Agency, according to a new report, has been intentionally hindering research on marijuana for four decades, which should come as a surprise to nobody. The key takeaway from the story:
[The new report] also criticizes the agency for creating a ""regulatory Catch-22"" by arguing there is not enough scientific evidence to support rescheduling marijuana while simultaneously impeding the research that would produce such evidence.A spokesperson at the DEA declined to comment on the report.
In Nevada, ""None of these candidates"" won the Democratic primary election for the nomination to run against the well-liked governor, Brian Sandoval. This is partly due to the fact that Sandoval is likely to win re-election no matter who runs against him, but it's still pretty funny for ""none of the above"" to win an election (due to Nevada's quirky ballots, which always include this option).
President Obama is visiting an Indian reservation today (the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Nation), becoming only the third president in American history ever to do so (Clinton did so in 1999, and F.D.R. was the first). From the story, which most of the media is likely to ignore:
Obama is making his first visit as president to an Indian reservation, where he will tout the strides his administration has made with Native Americans, unveil new education and economic measures aimed at Native Americans and speak of the difficult work that remains to pull many tribal members out of crippling poverty and endemic unemployment.Many tribal leaders say Obama has done more in six years for Native Americans than all of his predecessors combined. The administration has given land back to tribes, worked one-on-one with tribal governments and is cracking down on crime in Indian Country. ""The best thing that's happened to Indian Country has been President Obama being elected,"" said Dave Archambault II, chairman of Standing Rock.
In other Native American news, a television ad called ""Proud To Be"" was run during a basketball championship game which featured many Native Americans stating what they are proud to be called. The ad ends with: ""Native Americans call themselves many things. The one thing they don't..."" which then shows a picture of a Washington Redskins football helmet. You can see the full two-minute version of this powerful ad in the story at Huffington Post.
In international news, Iraq is self-destructing. This led the Wall Street Journal to call for a few airstrikes and some American paratroopers to fix the problem, because we all know how well that turned out the last time, right? The Maliki government has dug its own grave, and now it is about to lie in it. Obama, thankfully, stated that there would be no new American boots on the ground any time soon.
OK, what else? What's that? Something about Virginia? Oh, right! This week marked the 47th anniversary of the Loving v. Virginia Supreme Court case which threw out all the racist miscegenation laws that still remained on the books, and allowed people to get married no matter what their skin color. Certainly a milestone to celebrate!
I am kidding, of course, because there were two big stories out of Virginia this week, and they were both pretty stunning. First there was the Democratic state senator who was bribed into quitting by state Republicans, so that his daughter could be confirmed as a judge and also so he could get a plum job on the state tobacco board. When the story broke, Phillip Puckett hastily withdrew his name for consideration from the tobacco gig, but the upshot is that the Virginia state senate went from a 20-20 political split to 20-19.
Even a story about such naked political bribery was quickly overshadowed, however, by the first House Majority Leader ever (since the position was created in 1899, mind you) to lose his primary election. Yes, Eric Cantor's days haunting the halls of the Capitol are indeed now numbered. Since so much has already been written about this political earthquake, we'll just summarize the high points quickly.
The immediate reaction was one of shock and surprise. The reason for Cantor's loss was endlessly theorized over (including the possible ""Cooter effect"" -- the most amusing theory yet), but the emerging conventional wisdom was that it was due to Cantor's all-but-non-existent support for immigration reform. Upon closer examination, this was likely not the core reason for his defeat, but that's not going to matter to House Republicans, who are likely to avoid voting on any immigration bill until pork barrels grow wings (or at least until 2017). Even though an actual supporter of immigration reform (Senator Lindsey Graham) handily won his own primary against multiple Tea Partiers.
Cantor immediately announced his resignation as Majority Leader, effective next month. The vote to replace him will take place next Thursday, Speaker John Boehner announced. The jockeying for the number two position in the House began immediately, but a funny thing happened on the way to the Tea Party -- the man in the number three position looks likely to take over from Cantor, even though he is even more centrist than Cantor ever was. Several candidates more acceptable to the Tea Partiers put their names forward, and then hastily withdrew (after counting noses). First to bow out was Jeb Hensarling, followed by fellow Texan Pete Sessions. Today, Raul Labrador from Idaho announced he's in the running, but it's looking like Californian Kevin McCarthy may already have enough votes to win next week. The entire scramble has reminded many of a high school class president election -- nothing more than a ferocious bout of gladhandling and backslapping to win a popularity contest.
We've got almost a full week before the (secret ballot) votes are counted, so who knows what will happen next in this fast-moving story? Stay tuned!
President Obama deserves at least an Honorable Mention for his visit to the Standing Rock Sioux Nation, especially considering this is only the third such visit ever.
Attorney General Eric Holder also deserves an Honorable Mention, for officially supporting a proposal by the U.S. Sentencing Commission to lessen the sentences of low-level drug offenders currently in federal prisons (making sentencing reform retroactive, in other words). Holder continues to show that he has had a true change of heart on the whole War On Drugs issue, and for that he deserves credit.
But we're going to hand the Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week to Senator Elizabeth Warren, for getting very close to passing a bill which would reform student loans. Her bill ultimately failed to clear the filibuster hurdle by a vote of 56-38, but this really should be read as 57-37 (Harry Reid had to vote ""no"" so that the bill can be reintroduced later, for technical reasons). Three Republicans crossed the aisle and voted with Democrats, meaning the bill could pass if only three more follow suit. While the loss was a disappointment, the closeness of the vote was impressive enough for her to win this week's MIDOTW award.
[Congratulate Senator Elizabeth Warren on her Senate contact page, to let her know you appreciate her efforts.]
There were, unfortunately, a number of candidates for Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week this week. The weirdest one can't even really be called a Democrat, since he obviously is trying to game the election system -- he ran and lost several races in Arizona as a Republican, and then decided not only to reregister as a Democrat but to actually change his name to ""Cesar Chavez."" The grandson of the more-famous bearer of that name is suing to get this guy off the Democratic primary ballot. ""Chavez"" (né Scott Fistler) deserves at least a (Dis-)Honorable Mention, no matter what party he really hails from.
A group of Rhode Island state senators deserve a group (Dis-)Honorable Mention, for acting like Republicans this week. They're pushing a bill that would block any local laws which raise the minimum wage -- an action normally taken by Republicans to pre-empt more progressive city laws from taking effect.
Debbie Wasserman Schultz, normally a quite progressive politician, deserves her own (Dis-)Honorable Mention this week for coming out against a proposed medical marijuana ballot initiative in her home state of Florida. The reaction from Americans for Safe Access, and from a guy described as ""one of the state's major Democratic donors"" was swift:
A 30-second ASA ad stated that Wasserman Schultz ""thinks it's okay for medical marijuana patients to go to federal prison.""[John] Morgan, whose family members have used marijuana for debilitating pain, said he raised $250,000 for Wasserman Schultz at his home a couple of years ago. ""I will never let her come to my house again for a huge fundraiser,"" Morgan said.
Let this be a warning to Democrats everywhere -- the people are leading on this issue. This is one major method successfully used by gay rights supporters to get Democrats on board -- withholding previously-generous donations to politicians. Democrats, please take note.
But the Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week just has to go to Virginia state senator (ex-senator, now) Phillip P. Puckett, the guy who was bribed by Republicans to quit his elected position for nothing more than a job offer and a vote on his daughter's judicial future. Even if he had reaped these rewards, it would likely not have been illegal under Virginia's lax political ethics laws, but that's immaterial. Whether the law says so or not, such a deal would have been unethical by pretty much any standard. He should truly be ashamed of himself, and he has clearly earned this week's MDDOTW award.
[Phillip Puckett is now a private citizen, and it is our standing policy not to provide contact information for such people, sorry.]
Volume 308 (6/13/14)
Quite the mixed bag this week, for our talking points. We could have written seven of these just on the Cantor upset alone, but decided that would have been too unseemly. Instead, we limited our Cantor glee to only two, because other things were indeed happening this week that need pointing out.
As always, these are offered up for Democrats everywhere to freely use, whether during a television interview or around your workplace's water cooler. In other words, these are for everyone from high-ranking politicians to the selenofriggatriskaidekaphobics among us!
 Congress can act fast!
This is worth pointing out -- because it disproves a piece of conventional inside-the-Beltway wisdom.
""For all the talk of divided government, polarization, and gridlock, Congress can actually act pretty fast when it is motivated by shame. Although the media didn't take much note of it, both the House and the Senate are quickly moving to put a bill on President Obama's desk which will bring much-needed reforms to the Department of Veterans Affairs. These reforms have, in fact, been necessary for years now, but Congress refused to act. But in the bright light of the recent scandal, Congress acted with blinding speed to enact major reforms to the V.A. system. The vote in the Senate was 93-3 and it passed the House unanimously. Please remember this the next time anyone tells you Congress can't get anything done in a timely fashion. Because when the media effectively turns the spotlight on shameful situations, Congress can act with surprising speed.""
 Hope the steaks were worth it, Eric
This was the most amusing aspect of the Cantor dethroning.
""Eric Cantor's campaign spent almost as much just on steak dinners alone as his opponent spent in total to beat him. There's a lesson in here for fat-cat politicians everywhere: just having a campaign chest full of millions of dollars does not guarantee you an election victory. Eric Cantor spent something like $173 for every vote he got, while his opponent spent less than six bucks per vote. Maybe Cantor should have just bought a steak dinner for every voter in his district -- it probably would have been a cheaper campaign, that way. I sure hope those were tasty steaks, Eric!""
 Tea Party failure
This falls into the category of ""rubbing it in,"" but it's been that kind of week, hasn't it?
""A Tea Partier took down the number two Republican in the House leadership, but in the race to replace him it looks like an Establishment Republican who is to Cantor's left is going to get the job. So the Tea Party got rid of one insufficiently pure leader, but they don't seem to be able to muster the strength to replace him with one of their own. Instead, what they're getting is someone even less pure (by their standard). Not exactly an overwhelming victory for the Tea Party, was it?""
 Obama moves on student loans
While Elizabeth Warren's bill failed, Obama did what he could.
""President Obama introduced new student loan rules which will save money for over five million students. That is an impressive accomplishment, to be sure. But during the same week, the Republicans in the Senate blocked more important reforms to the student loan program, for unfathomable reasons. Obama acted as he did because Republicans won't let Congress move forward on the issue. Voters in families across the country should take note, because it is obvious that Democrats are fighting to reduce the burden of student loans while Republicans are fighting for American students to pay more money in interest to the government. Every mom and dad should remember this when they enter the voting booth this November.""
 So much for being deficit hawks, eh?
This one hasn't gotten nearly the attention it should.
""Republicans in the House voted this week to add tens of billions of dollars to the deficit and to the national debt. Oh, sure, they talk a good line about how they're 'deficit hawks,' but then they turn right around and extend tax breaks without paying for a dime of it. Republicans insist loudly whenever Democrats propose any budget measure that 'it must be paid for!' but the reality is that they are just fine with extending tax breaks without even attempting to pay for it. In other words, Republicans are allowed to do all the deficit spending they want, while Democrats have to pay for every dime of every proposal -- including even emergency aid packages. The stench of hypocrisy was thick over Republican House members this week, and everyone should remember this the next time you hear any Republican crying crocodile tears over the deficit, in the future.""
 Pork is good!
Speaking of the stench of Republican hypocrisy...
""I see that Trent Lott has cut a very interesting ad for Thad Cochran's primary runoff campaign. In it, Lott begs the voters of Mississippi to remember all that wonderful pork-barrel spending that Cochran brings home -- and in which he freely admits that federal spending is a good thing because it equals 'jobs.' After hearing Republicans decrying earmarks and pork and federal spending for years and years, it is simply astounding that Trent Lott -- who is now a powerful lobbyist, I should mention -- thinks that the message to win over voters is: 'more pork!' I mean, do these guys ever listen to themselves?""
 War on genitalia?
Finally, in the ""War On Women"" category, we have a doozy to close with this week.
""I see that conservative radio personality Mark Levin thinks he has the answer to the Republicans' dismal record on women. He confidently advises the Republican Party how they can win elections. Not only is the advice bad, since he is saying 'ignore women voters,' but the way he put it was downright offensive. According to Levin, Republicans should, and I quote, 'stop chasing ethnic groups, stop chasing genitalia.' Wow. Addressing the issues that women voters care about is 'chasing genitalia'? Really? No wonder Republicans have such problems convincing women to vote for them, if this is their attitude.""

Donald Trump Jr. tweeted a photo of himself poolside giving two thumbs up and sporting a bright green T-shirt reading “Very Fake News.” Looks about right.
Then there was the explanation that turned everything upside down. “I’m going to have to buy 5-10,000 of these to pass around to our buddies in the #MSM. In the meantime I’ll model it for them,” he tweeted.
You’re no model, one reader tweeted back.
The wearing of the shirt was not apparently sparked by a gripe about a specific mainstream media story that stuck the Trumps — yet again — as “fake news.” But America’s mainstream media are pretty much a constant target of the family, Breitbart News and, ah, Russia Today.

Eighty-nine percent of all Americans who voted say they feel like they made the right choice in the presidential election, while just 3 percent regret their votes. Another 8 percent are unsure. 
Ninety-one percent of people who report having voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton, and 95 percent of those who report having voted for Republican Donald Trump, say they feel as though they made the right choice.
  A majority of those who didn’t make it out to the polls, meanwhile, say they don’t regret their decision not to vote, although more than one-quarter wish they had done so.  
Sixty percent of Americans who didn’t vote say they don’t mind not having done so, while 27 percent say they wish they had cast a ballot. Given a do-over, 27 percent of nonvoters say they’d choose Clinton, and 19 percent say they’d choose Trump. Sixteen percent say they’d pick someone else, and 38 percent maintain that they still wouldn’t vote.
Asked to choose from a list of reasons for why they stayed home, those who regret not voting were most likely to say it was because they weren’t registered. Very few ― just over 10 percent of those who regret not voting, or about 1 percent of the nation as a whole ― say that they stayed home because they didn’t think the race was close enough for their vote to matter. 
The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Nov. 15-17 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.

644,POLITICS,Iraq's Sunnis Won't Fight ISIS for U.S.,"Peter Van Buren, ContributorAuthor of the forthcoming ""Hooper's War,"" ""Ghosts of Tom Joad:...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iraqs-sunnis-wont-fight-i_b_6067896.html,"Iraq's Sunnis won't fight ISIS for the U.S. says NIQASH, a non-profit media organization operating out of Berlin. Without Sunni support, America's war in Iraq cannot succeed. Here's why.",2014-11-03,POLITICS,"Iraq's Sunnis won't fight ISIS for the U.S. says NIQASH, a non-profit media organization operating out of Berlin. Without Sunni support, America's war in Iraq cannot succeed. Here's why.  Negotiations Fail
According to NIQASH, a source at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad said there have been secret negotiations between various Sunni Muslim armed factions, via Arab and Iraqi Kurdish intermediaries, for the past three months. At the request of U.S. diplomats and military personnel, Shia officials from the Iraqi government have also been meeting with the leaders of these groups in Erbil, Kurdistan and Amman, Jordan.
At the same time General John Allen, the Obama's appointed coordinator of U.S. efforts in Iraq, has been trying to contact the Sunni tribal leaders he worked with in Anbar during the previous war's ""Awakening."" ""But it was surprising,"" a NIQASH source reported, ""Most of General Allen's former allies refused to cooperate with us. And some of them are actually now living outside of Iraq because of the Iraqi government's policies.""
Oops. With some irony, America's failure to secure the 2006 Awakening caused those Sunnis sympathetic to America's aims to flee Shia persecution. Those ""good guys"" are thus not available in 2014 to help out America in the current war.
ISIS and the Sunnis
When ISIS first took control of Sunni areas in western Iraq, anger towards the Shia government in Baghdad caused many to see them as liberators from the Iraqi army. The army, along with paramilitary police from the Interior Ministry, had engaged in a multi-year campaign of beating, imprisoning and arresting Sunnis, to the point where many felt that Baghdad was occupying, not governing, the Sunni majority areas. For the Sunnis and ISIS, the Baghdad government was a common enemy, and a marriage of convenience formed.
Recent events in Baghdad do little to assuage Sunni fears. A recent report suggests the new Iraqi Prime Minister may nominate a Shia Badr Militia leader as Interior Minister. Since the Shias took control of Iraq following the American invasion of 2003, the Interior Ministry, which controls the police and the prisons, has been a prime tool of repression and punishment.
Still, cracks in the ISIS-Sunni relationship have started to form. Many of the Sunni groups, especially those led by former Baathists, are largely secular in nature, seeing their Sunni ties more as broadly cultural than strictly religious. ISIS' requests to pledge allegiance to its cause, coupled with demands to implement Sharia law, have created friction. Some internecine fighting has taken place. The U.S. has sought to exploit these issues to break the indigenous Sunnis away from ISIS, and ultimately to turn the Sunnis into American proxy boots on the ground as was done with the Kurds.
America's problem is that most Sunnis are fearful about cooperating via America with the Shia government in Baghdad. They fear history will repeat itself and the Americans and the Shia government will betray them, exactly as they betrayed them only a few years ago when the Awakening movement collapsed. Quite a pickle.
Sorry America
The Sunnis seem to be choosing a middle ground, one which does not serve America's interests. 
According to a 1920s Revolution Brigades (Sunni militia) leader, various militias came to the decision ""not to support the international coalition against ISIS. They also decided not to cooperate with ISIS either. If the [Iraqi] army or the [Shia] militias attack [Sunni] areas they control though, they will fight both groups.""
""We are against the acts of the hardline Islamic State. And we are also against bombed cars exploding randomly in Baghdad,"" Abu Samir al-Jumaili, one of the Sunni Mujahideen Army's leaders in the Anbar province, told NIQASH. ""However we are also opposed to the government's sectarian policies against Sunnis... In 2006 we cooperated with the government to expel al Qaeda from Sunni cities but the government did not keep its end of the bargain. They chased our leaders and arrested us... The ISIS group are terrorists but so are the Shia militias.""
History is a Witch
There is no way America can succeed in its goals in Iraq-- repel ISIS and keep the country together-- without the active participation of the Sunnis. It is very unlikely that that will happen. American strategy rests on the assumption that the Sunnis can be bribed and coerced into breaking with ISIS, no matter the shape of things in Baghdad. That's hard to imagine. As with al Qaeda in Iraq during the American occupation years, the Islamic State is Sunni muscle against a Shia government that, left to its own devices, would continue to marginalize, if not simply slaughter, them. Starting in 2006, U.S. officials did indeed bribe and coerce some Sunni tribal leaders into accepting arms and payments in return for fighting insurgent outfits, including al-Qaeda. That deal, then called the Anbar Awakening, came with assurances that the United States would always stand by them.
America didn't stand. Instead, it turned the program over to the Shia government and headed for the door marked exit. The Shias promptly reneged on the deal.
Once bitten, twice shy, so why, only a few years later, would the Sunnis go for what seems to be essentially the same bad deal? It appears they will not, and that by itself suggests the current Iraq war will end much the same as the previous one. It is foolish for America to expect otherwise.

Trump was disappointed with the rollout of Pence, and the reaction to him, on several levels. He was first piqued that the news leaked before he’d gotten around to telling the runners-up, Newt Gingrich and Chris Christie, about his choice. He then had second thoughts, postponed the announcement and spent Thursday night trying to find a way to back out of his choice, according to multiple news reports and the source close to Trump. 
Trump sees Pence as a politically safe but unexciting choice, the source said. When non-politicians fantasize about running for president, they delight in imagining the unorthodox, thrilling running mate they might choose. For Trump to have ended up paired with such a standard pol, after a year of violating every campaign norm in the book, must be a major letdown. 
Multiple sources say that Trump wants to name Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, as his attorney general, although knowing Trump, he could change his mind at any moment. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who plays a major role in the campaign, fought against Christie as a VP pick, as reported this week by HuffPost blogger Laura Goldman and later corroborated elsewhere.
Retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, whom Trump at one point floated as a potential VP, will surely be on the short list for defense secretary, unless of course Kid Rock makes himself available.

649,POLITICS,This Is What The Audience Looks Like At A Trump Event On African-American 'Concerns',Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-black-voters_us_57e2c70ce4b0e80b1b9fc038,Pretty darn white.,2016-09-21,POLITICS,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump continued his supposed outreach to African-American voters on Wednesday with a pair of events at a black church in Ohio.
The first function, which the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland Heights billed as a “meeting on African-American concerns,” featured Trump flanked by a few of his most prominent black supporters. Pastor Darrell Scott played host as a leader of the church. Legendary boxing promoter and convicted killer Don King introduced Trump, at one point dropping the N-word. The setting may have projected an air of diversity and inclusion, but it was a mostly white audience that sat and listened as Trump declared black communities can’t get “much worse” and that only he could “fix it.”
Trump then hurried to another room in the church to film a closed town hall, hosted by Fox News’ Sean Hannity. The cable news network described the gathering as a forum to “discuss the core issues and concerns surrounding African-Americans this 2016 election cycle.”
It’s not entirely clear what “surrounding African-Americans” means in this context, but a photo of the audience suggests the event itself was “surrounded” by white people.
The crowd certainly didn’t appear to reflect the church’s usual congregation or the general population of Cleveland Heights, which is 42.5 percent black, according to the most recent Census figures.
The Hannity special is scheduled to air Wednesday night at 10 p.m. 
By this point, the frequent lack of diversity at Trump’s events, and among his supporters more broadly, has been well documented. Like many Republican candidates, Trump has struggled to court people of color, especially African-Americans. His support among black voters has fallen as low as 0 percent in a few swing states, according to some polls.
Yet Trump has repeatedly made his pitch to black voters at campaign events attended almost exclusively by white people. Many now see this strategy as an attempt not to win over black voters, but to increase Trump’s palatability among white Republicans and independents who are concerned about Trump’s troubling record on race and his enthusiastic supporters in the white supremacist community. By making at least a perfunctory effort to woo black communities, Trump may be able to persuade some white people that he’s not racist at all.
Of course, just the idea that some Americans might be so easily convinced says a lot about how reluctant we still are as a nation to identify and confront racism in all its forms.

650,POLITICS,Surge In LLC Contributions Brings More Mystery About True Donors,"OpenSecrets Blog, ContributorPublished by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics an...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/surge-in-llc-contributions-brings-more-mystery-about_us_590222a7e4b00acb75f185a1,Donald Trump’s inaugural committee did well by almost any standard: Doubling the previous record for cash raised to fund,2017-04-27,POLITICS," by Ashley Balcerzak 
Donald Trump’s inaugural committee did well by almost any standard: Doubling the previous record for cash raised to fund festivities around a new president’s swearing-in, it took in contributions from every major sector of the economy, and from donors who had steered clear of his campaign prior to the election.
The committee also received about $10.6 million — or about 10 percent of its total raised — from roughly 60 limited liability companies, or LLCs — structures often set up by small businesses that provide favorable tax treatment while also protecting their owners’ assets.
But some exist mainly to mask people’s identities.
Names of many of the inaugural LLC donors are straightforward, like Altria Client Services LLC, which clearly is affiliated with the tobacco company. Others read like a can of alphabet soup just exploded: HFNWA LLC, which gave $1 million; BV-2 LLC, $350,000; HGI DB Fund LLC, $250,000; HGIM LLC Corporate, same amount; or HJK LLC, $100,000, to name a few.
OpenSecrets Blog and other news outlets tracked down the people behind some of these using state corporate records searches and similar sources. (Franklin Haney, Gordon Sondland, Chad Guidry and his brother Shane, and H.J. Kalikow were behind that batch of five.) But the individuals who control a handful of the others on the list — like BH Group, LLC, which contributed $1 million — haven’t been nailed down.
By comparison, President Barack Obama’s 2013 inaugural committee received funds from just six LLCs, none of which had mysterious backers; they gave a total of $496,750.
And inaugural committees aren’t the only recipients of surging LLC contributions — their donations to presidential campaigns and super PACs in 2016 also spiked: About 840 of them gave roughly $21 million in the last cycle — almost double the $12 million by 109 LLCs in 2012, the first presidential race after the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision.
Who is that man behind the curtain?
Exactly what LLCs can and can’t do in the political realm depends on how they file tax returns: as corporations, or not. If not, their revenues, losses and so on are included on the personal returns of the individual or partners who own the LLC.
Corporate LLCs and LLPs (limited liability partnerships) can’t donate directly to candidates; the noncorporate kind can, as long as they report the names of the individuals responsible for the donations. The contributions count toward an individual’s giving limits ($2,700 per candidate per election, but there’s no limit on gifts to super PACs.)
But many limited liability donations are reported with no names included. “LLC donations have created this whole new realm of transparency problems,” said Brendan Fischer, federal program director at the Campaign Legal Center. “They require minimal transparency and they are easy to set up, making them an appealing vehicle for a donor that doesn’t want his name attached.”
A donation could also cross the legal line by allowing foreign or corporate funds to flow into an election.
“A foreign national or a foreign individual or an agent could easily set up an LLC in Delaware, make a contribution and if the true source is not disclosed, the public would have no way of knowing,” Fischer noted.
LLCs gave about $828,000 to presidential campaign committees in 2016 — a modest sum given that the cost of the presidential election was an estimated $2.4 billion, and 26 candidates raised $1.5 billion, but way up from the $7,500 that these organizations gave to White House campaigns in the 2012 cycle. Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio) led the pack with $160,000, followed by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with $112,000 and Gov. Chris Christie (R-N.J.) with $110,000. Trump came in at No. 7 with $49,000. (In our analysis, we only included donations from entities with “LLC” or “LLP” in their names, which means we have certainly undercounted.)
But it is Trump’s LLC donations that have spurred the most queries from the Federal Election Commission, even though his haul from such companies was modest compared with that of other candidates. The agency wants to know whether around 140 LLC donations of $91,000 (about $52,000 of which went into Trump’s campaign committee) were legal. (This figure is larger than our count of Trump’s LLCs because it includes groups that are LLCs but don’t have those letters in their names.) In many cases, Trump didn’t report the partners’ names, as the rules require. 
One letter from the FEC highlighted a company with a headline-strewn past: Clean Energy Capital, LLC, which gave $1,000 to Trump’s Make America Great Again joint fundraising committee in early October. Two years earlier, it was a different agency, the SEC, that was interested in this Tuscon-based private equity fund and its CEO, Scott Brittenham, accusing them of misallocating funds. Brittenham and the fund settled the federal charges, paying roughly $2.2 million. The campaign reattributed the donation, $800 of which had been allocated to Trump’s campaign from the JFC, to Brittenham.
The campaign has fixed some of the other LLC donations flagged by the FEC, too. At least six were refunded because the campaign could not determine if they were legal or not. In some other cases, the campaign amended its FEC report to include partnership attributions. At least one query from the agency, concerning nine LLCs, is still awaiting a response, which is due by May 12.
“Our Committee has safeguards in place to ensure that all contributions are made by eligible contributors only,” wrote campaign treasurer Timothy Jost in September and November letters to the FEC.
Most of the LLC donor action was with outside spending groups. Former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Fla.) led the presidential pack with $6 million in such contributions to his super PAC, Right to Rise. He was followed by a fellow Florida Republican, Sen. Marco Rubio, with $5.5 million from LLC donors to Conservative Solutions, the super PAC dedicated to electing him; and Kasich, who saw $2.2 million in LLC donations to his super PAC, New Day for America.
Trump moved up, coming in at No. 4 with his groups getting $1.6 million from LLCs.
With some of these organizations, it takes quite a bit of digging to uncover the name of the human responsible for the contribution. For instance, MMWP12, LLC gave $500,000 to pro-Kasich super PAC New Day Independent Media Committee. The Center for Public Integrity reported the entity was incorporated in Montana the day before it made the big gift, and is linked to another LLC, K2M, that lists a former Kasich staff member, Paul Johannsen, as one of its officers. Another example: The New York Times identified the true source of the $250,000 from V3 231, LLC to pro-Cruz Stand for Principal PAC: Ben Nash, the CEO of PCS Wireless. And the AP uncovered the original donor behind a half-million-dollar donation from IGX LLC in Delaware (in which three such names are registered) to Rubio’s super PAC.to be self-described investor Andrew Duncan of Brooklyn, N.Y., .
Nobody was able to top the $11 million that Restore Our Future and other groups backing then-GOP nominee Mitt Romney scooped up from LLCs in 2012 — and which also triggered hunts for the real donors.
Overall, the number of LLCs actively contributing at the federal level and the amount they gave to super PACs (including non-presidential ones) shot up in 2016, with around 850 of them doling out almost $32.2 million. That’s compared to the approximately 290 LLCs giving $8 million in 2014 for the mid-year elections, and 310 LLCs donating $22 million in 2012.
Eight super PACs, with all but one supporting Republicans, received at least $1 million from LLCs last election. After the pro-Bush Right to Rise ($6 million) and pro-Rubio Conservative Solutions PAC ($5.5 million), the Congressional Leadership Fund, which is the super PAC offshoot of the National Republican Congressional Committee and works to elect GOP House candidates, was the third runner up, harvesting $2 million from these organizations.
Trump himself is no stranger to doing business via LLCs. The Wall Street Journal estimated almost half the income listed on his financial disclosure reports (at least $304 million) came from assets held in 96 LLCs, and he owns more than 500 in all. These entities are frequently used in the real estate industry, with each project being set up as its own LLC, protecting the LLC owner from liability for debts and bringing advantageous tax treatment. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and another real estate maven, included 204 LLCs on his personal financial disclosure.
Official inaction
LLC contributions were a hot topic at the beginning of 2016, with advocacy groups filing multiple complaints with the FEC saying the corporate names were hiding the true sources of the funds. One target: Children of Israel LLC, which donated $150,000 to a super PAC supporting GOP White House contender Mike Huckabee, $400,000 to a pro-Cruz outside group and $334,000 to the Republican National Committee.
The Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint against Children of Israel, alleging it was an illegal straw donor, and others against DE First Holdings, which gave $1 million to a liberal super PAC, Coalition for Progress, the day after it was incorporated, and Décor Services LLC, which gave $250,000 to a pro-Christie super PAC 16 days after it was formed. Another, IGX LLC, faced the same scrutiny after donating $500,000 to a pro-Rubio super PAC. The Associated Press reported the owner, Andrew Duncan, admitted to using the LLC to donate because “he was worried about reprisals.” The complaints are currently still pending, and the Campaign Legal Center has not heard back from the FEC.
(The Intercept reported after the complaint was filed that big donor Saul Fox was the man behind Children of Israel by analyzing an amended RNC filing.)
Separately, last month a federal court in Washington, D.C., rejected the FEC’s attempt to throw out a lawsuit by the Campaign Legal Center and Democracy 21 against the agency in connection with LLC contributions in the 2012 campaign cycle. The advocacy groups sued to force the FEC to investigate five cases involving LLC contributions to super PACs supporting Romney, Obama, and a group of Republicans; the agency had dropped the cases after failing to get the requisite four commissioners to vote to move forward.
“I think this huge increase you’re seeing from one presidential election cycle to another is largely due to the deadlocks on the FEC,” said Brett Kappel, partner at Akerman LLP, “because contributors learn that if they use an LLC it’s unlikely there will be any issues with the FEC, which has to have a four vote majority to do anything.”
In addition, says another close observer, the increase may foretell the next chapter in the post-Citizens United development of campaign finance strategy.
“When super PACs first started out contributors generally consisted of individuals, so this phase two maturation is where we see more businesses like LLCs that are closely held and controlled by individuals,” said Caleb Burns, a partner at Wiley Rien. “I think this is the middle of a trend, where ultimately we will have other businesses in the not so distant future, including public companies becoming bigger players as super PAC donors.”

651,POLITICS,Minnesota Woman Blamed For Al Franken's Fall Had Nothing To Do With It,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lindsey-port-al-franken-minnesota_us_5ab92abce4b054d118e59175,"Lindsey Port accused another man of harassment. But fellow Democrats say she ""softened the ground"" for Franken's resignation.",2018-03-27,POLITICS,"Lindsey Port, 35, doesn’t really know Al Franken. She met the Minnesota Democrat in passing at political events, but that’s about it. And she never even called on him to resign from the Senate after a number of other women accused him of sexual harassment.
But for some reason, she’s being blamed for his downfall.
Port has spoken out about sexual harassment. In November, as a Democratic candidate for the Minnesota state House, she and state Rep. Erin Maye Quade (D) accused state Sen. Dan Schoen (D) of harassing them. Schoen eventually stepped down, and Port became one of the most visible faces of the Me Too movement in Minnesota.
She initially received a flood of goodwill for speaking out. But the reaction changed when the Franken allegations surfaced.
Port’s willingness to call attention to sexual harassment went from being applauded to being questioned. Members of her own party said she had “softened the ground” for Franken’s resignation in early January, and some people even wondered if she was secretly a conservative operative who had planned to take down the popular senator all along.
On social media, Port saw comments that questioned her identity, motives and truthfulness.
This Facebook commenter above was right that it wasn’t just a “coincidence” that the Schoen and Franken scandals happened so close together ― but it’s not because there was a large GOP conspiracy to bring them down. The country was in the middle of the Me Too moment, when powerful men like Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer were facing a reckoning for their years of abuse, and more women were feeling emboldened to speak up.
That the backlash came from within her own community is particularly disheartening for Port.
“I honestly think the most frustrating part of it has been not only Democrats ― this is our team, these are the people who are supposed to be with us ― but it has been primarily women. There’s definitely a generational divide, 100 percent. But it has primarily been women pushing this,” she said of the criticism she’s faced.
Speaking out has cost Port financially. About a week after Franken’s resignation, she dropped her state legislative bid because donors began pulling their contributions, and she felt she couldn’t focus on the district and its priorities.
Port also co-operates a nonprofit, Blueprint Campaigns, that helps progressive individuals from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds run for office. The nonprofit also lost donations.
“We had $70,000 pulled the week that Al Franken said he was going to resign,” Port said. “In that same window, I also lost $6,000 from my own campaign.”
One person asked that her contribution to the campaign be returned. The rest of the unhappy donors, to both the campaign and the nonprofit, pulled their pledges. One donor told Port that she was “too controversial” to support at that time, as MinnPost reported. Port had never had any contributions taken back before.
Meredith Stacey, Port’s partner at Blueprint, said she also noticed that after the allegations against Franken broke, people weren’t reaching out or returning their phone calls quite as frequently. 
“Democratic donor doors are very shut to me right now,” Port said. As evidence, she noted that Ken Martin, the chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (the state’s version of the Democratic Party), unfriended her on Facebook ― an accusation that he denies. 
“God’s honest truth, I’ve never unfriended anyone,” Martin said. “So to be honest with you, I don’t even know how to do it.”
“I guess what I am concerned by is any kind of insinuation that me personally or the state party hasn’t stood by Lindsey. We’ve been very supportive of her in these efforts. We believe her,” he added. “We think that at the end of the day, if there’s any retaliation going on ― as I mentioned to her the other day ― I want to know about it. Because I will call those donors myself.”
Port said she hasn’t been able to get Martin on the phone to tell him about the problems she’s had and the donations that were pulled. She also said she’s asked him to raise money to replace the sums that Blueprint Campaigns lost, and he hasn’t followed up. 
Martin said that he hadn’t heard from Port about any request to help her raise money and that he has tried to be as helpful as possible in supporting her.
Feelings about the Franken scandal are still raw in Minnesota. The issue remains so divisive that a number of state Democrats were only willing to give their opinion about the situation off the record. 
The former senator’s Facebook page is filled with people saying how much they miss him:
  “I am still incredibly bitter that you were forced to resign. You were/are one of the good guys.”   “I hope you don’t retire from politics, Al Franken. There was no due process when you left. I thought it was premature.”  
State Rep. Erin Maye Quade has also heard the insinuations that she and Port were part of some grand conspiracy to oust Franken or that they’d put party members in a difficult position because after denouncing Schoen, Democrats then were forced to weigh in on Franken.
“I’m the one who gets harassed, and all of a sudden I face all the consequences,” Maye Quade said. “No matter who it is, it’s always about the fall of men and never about the women who were just trying to work and do their job and have to endure this over and over and over.” 
“I was more surprised about how much my story was never really about me after that,” the lawmaker added. “It was always about the men and their downfall.” 
Port and Maye Quade aren’t the only women who have faced the ire of Franken supporters. At least one major Democratic donor has said she’ll reconsider her support for senators who called for Franken to quit ― including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who was one of his toughest critics. (Recall that Port never actually urged Franken to resign.)
MinnPost first reported on Port’s decision to drop her state legislative bid because of the backlash she received after the Franken scandal. The story received surprisingly little pickup, especially compared to the attention her initial allegations against Schoen garnered.
But one person who did notice was Laura Flynn, a member of the advisory board for the Movement Voter Project, which raises funds for nonpartisan and progressive groups around the country that are mobilizing and doing voter engagement work. In February, Flynn mobilized other MVP donors and so far, they’ve raised $26,000 for Blueprint.
“Yes, this is a story about an individual woman facing backlash because of what she did, because of speaking out. ... But secondly, it’s a real question for the Democratic Party,” Flynn said. “If you’re going to turn on the most forward-thinking young people who can actually go out there and run grassroots campaigns and win elections ― it’s very clear here in Minnesota, we’re not going to be able to win the statehouse if we’re going to silence or quash those voices.”
Another person who has supported Port has been state Rep. Ilhan Omar (D), who made history in 2016 when she became the first Somali-American legislator in the country.
“I think that for women, we’ve always known what is at stake,” Omar said. “It’s really important for people to realize that once you take that step, yes, there are people who are going to be against you, but there are going to be people ― if not as much, but more ― who will stand by you, who will uplift you, who will celebrate you for living your truth, for being brave and for continuing to widen the door for other women to step through.”

652,POLITICS,Bill de Blasio Thinks He's Proved His Haters Wrong When It Comes To Pre-K,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/de-blasio-prek_us_58ff9edde4b0073d3e79fec0,The New York mayor plans to roll out free preschool for 3-year-olds.,2017-04-26,POLITICS,"When Bill de Blasio ran for New York City mayor in 2013, his plan to enact a universal preschool program for 4-year-olds was treated more like a lofty ideal than a workable promise. American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten suggested the goal was unrealistic, and called the proposal’s early iteration “non-serious.” Experts were skeptical that he could adequately overcome the obstacles to providing pre-K for so many children. 
Four years later, de Blasio has successfully implemented a Pre-K for All program that serves about 70,000 kids. But as he gears up to run for his second term, he has ambitious plans to expand the early education services offered to city families. On Monday, de Blasio announced plans for 3-K for All, a program that could roll out free pre-K for all the city’s 3-year-olds by 2021.
It’s a plan that is undoubtedly ambitious for the largest city in the country, and its scope stands out even among other progressive states and municipalities with preschool programs. Yet, unlike when de Blasio first proposed universal pre-K on the campaign trail, this proposal is getting taken seriously, he says. 
“When I first introduced pre-K, I can’t tell you how many people told me it was a pipe dream,” de Blasio told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. “The press was openly dismissive,” questioning where the money to pay for the plan would come from, and whether it could serve so many children so quickly, he said. 
This time around, neither “political insiders” nor “everyday people” seem flippant about the plan, “even if it’s going to take a lot of work and time.”
3-K for All will face obvious obstacles ― and it is rolling out at a slow, incremental pace compared to its Pre-K for All predecessor, which took two years. The city already struggled to find space for centers for 4-year-olds, and de Blasio predicts that it will have to “build early childhood centers from scratch” over the next few years. The state budget helped fund the first pre-K program, and the city will need significant funding commitments from the state and federal government to fully enact the new plan as well. 
The mayor is optimistic that the city’s efforts on this front will inspire people in both red and blue areas to continue to fight for young children on the local level. There are few indications that Donald Trump’s administration will prioritize early childhood education, and even when Barack Obama was president and pushed the issue, Congress didn’t pass funding for a nationwide pre-K program. Democratic and Republican voters both express support for the issue, though. 
“This is something happening to the grassroots and bubbling up all over the country,” said de Blasio. “What we do know is what happens locally, that’s the tangible reality. Local dynamics around the country add up to something.”
Pre-K for all has generally received successful marks, although it has not been without criticism. Preschool classrooms tend to be heavily segregated by race, similar to the city’s K-12 system. 
But overall it has succeeded in its goals of giving parents greater early childhood education options. This is a luxury that de Blasio did not have when his kids were growing up, and he worried about whether his kids would get a spot at the competitive preschool center near them. He says the experienced helped spur him to champion this issue. 
“I think there’s a real argument here that we got to create a less stressful environment for parents,” said de Blasio. “This is the march of history, and it’s about showing it can happen and work in places all over the country.”

The Republican National Committee will soon have a vacancy at the top of the party as current chairman Reince Priebus becomes White House chief of staff when Trump takes office on Jan. 20.
While Trump did not signal his support for McDaniel at the rally, two party officials said he is pushing for her. McDaniel is a niece of 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.
The Trump transition team had no immediate comment.
The officials said Trump appreciated the role McDaniel played in helping deliver the state of Michigan for him in the Nov. 8 election.
In a speech that preceded Trump’s remarks in Grand Rapids, McDaniel celebrated the end to a vote recount effort in Michigan by Green Party candidate Jill Stein.
“The recount in Michigan is over. The election is over. Our next president is Donald J. Trump,” she said. “Winning once was nice. But winning twice was huge.”
In his remarks, Trump expressed gratitude to Michigan voters for helping him win the presidency.
“We’re in your debt and we will never let you down,” he said.
Until this year, Michigan had not voted Republican since 1988. Trump won the Midwestern state by little more than 10,000 votes, and the state’s 16 electoral votes were critical to his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.
The Republican National Committee’s 168 elected members will choose their next chair at a meeting in mid-January, but they will be influenced by Trump’s view on who should head the party.
Another popular choice among party regulars is Matt Pinnell, the former chairman of the Oklahoma Republican Party.

They are giving giant ISPs like Verizon and Comcast the power to control what we can see and do online with new fees, throttling, and censorship. This will ruin the fundamentally open nature of the internet. This fight isn’t over, though. There is still a clear path to victory.
The organizations behind Battle For The Net are launching a new campaign to demand that Congress step in and restore net neutrality via the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The CRA lets elected officials in Congress overrule actions taken by Federal agencies like the FCC. And it’s different from a normal bill because it only requires a simple majority in the Senate and House to pass. 
There’s some poetic justice in it, since it’s the same procedure that ISP-backed lawmakers used to gut Internet privacy protections earlier this year. 
Given the level of public backlash and polls showing that 83% of voters from across the political spectrum oppose the FCC’s plan, and given that several Republicans have already started to publicly criticize the FCC vote, we have a real chance of making this happen.
But it won’t be easy. And it can only happen within 60 legislative days of the order going into effect.

655,POLITICS,North Carolina Board Of Elections Extends Voting Hours In Eight Durham County Precincts,Julia Craven and Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-voting-hours-extension_us_58224574e4b0e80b02cd81a2,Voting advocates sought to keep polling places open after technical issues.,2016-11-09,POLITICS,"DURHAM, N.C. ― The North Carolina State Board of Elections decided Tuesday evening to extend voting times for an hour in two Durham County precincts following technical issues. Six other precincts will have their hours extended based on exactly how many minutes voters were unable to cast ballots. 
The Cole Mill and Bethesda Ruritan precincts received 60-minute extensions. Creekside Elementary School and Glenn Elementary School precincts received an extra 45 minutes, Forest Hills Clubhouse and Greater Emmanuel Temple of Grace received an extra 30 minutes, McMannen United Methodist Church received 25 minutes, and Neal Middle School will stay open just 20 minutes longer.
After check-in machines at some polling sites in Durham County experienced glitches earlier on Tuesday, the board of elections ordered the county to transition to paper poll books for voter check-in. As the board noted, the electronic malfunction caused a delay with voter check-in, not with the ballots themselves, since all voters in Durham vote by paper ballot.
The glitches caused concerns throughout the county ― especially after the Bethesda Ruritan club precinct ran out of authorization-to-vote forms and had to delay voting for a short period of time. 
Robby Mook, the campaign manager for Hillary for America, urged the state board of elections to extend voting hours. North Carolina’s NAACP also called on the county to fix the problem and extend hours.
“We demand that they fix this glitch,” said Rev. Dr. William Barber, president of North Carolina NAACP, in a statement. “There were no glitches in early voting. Why now and why in a heavy black voting area?”
Thirty-seven percent of Durham County’s registered voters are black, according to CNN. 
The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a voting rights advocacy group, said in a press call on Tuesday morning that it had received calls from voters who feared there may not be enough paper ballots and that some voters were receiving provisional ballots.
But Samuel Gedman, the deputy director of elections for Durham County, said that won’t be an issue. 
“There’s an emergency paper process that we can go to in case there’s a power outage or some other problem with the building,” Gedman told The Huffington Post. “What we didn’t anticipate was going for the full day. What we’re doing now is just running supplies to make sure they have enough paper material to last them through the day.”
Voting rights group Democracy North Carolina filed a lawsuit in Wake County asking a state judge to take these delays into account and keep polling precincts open in at least five locations until 9 p.m. 
The lawsuit alleged that “many voters will lose their right to vote in this election” if the state board of elections is not compelled to extend voting hours until that time.
The court in Wake County denied the request to extend voting hours later Tuesday evening. 
In a statement, Allison Riggs, an attorney who helped bring the lawsuit, lamented the ruling.
“There is no good reason to close these polling places without giving people who were turned away the ability to return and cast their vote,” she said. “It is unacceptable to have Election Day ruined by technical problems.”

656,POLITICS,Republicans Could Protect Dreamers If They Wanted To. But Will They?,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republians-dreamers-daca_us_59acb953e4b0dfaafcf1255c,They're in a bind.,2017-09-04,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― Republican lawmakers who have said they sympathize with young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children will now get the chance to prove it. 
President Donald Trump has decided to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, with a six-month delay on enforcement, Politico and Reuters reported on Sunday evening. An official announcement is expected on Tuesday with further details. 
Ending the program would mean nearly 800,000 so-called “Dreamers” who have been in the U.S. since they were children would eventually lose two-year work permits and be at risk for deportation. 
Trump’s decision puts Republicans in a bind. Many of them have said they think something should be done to help Dreamers, and some pro-immigration-reform Republicans have joined Democrats to push for legislation.
But most Republicans ― including party leaders in the House and Senate ― have repeatedly voted to block legislation that would allow young undocumented immigrants to stay in the country. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) hasn’t allowed votes on bills that would allow legal status for Dreamers, and his predecessor, former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), let a comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013 die in the House.
Ryan and other GOP members now say they’re ready for legislation. But the question will be whether they’re willing to break from the past and work with Democrats to make it happen. Doing so could invite primary challenges from the right.
Ryan said on Friday that he had urged Trump not to end DACA because he believed Congress should pass a bill to protect Dreamers. 
“There are people in limbo,” Ryan said on the radio station WCLO in Janesville, Wisconsin. “These are kids that know no other country, who were brought here by their parents and don’t know another home, and so I really do believe there needs to be a legislative solution, that’s one that we’re working on.”
Others similarly urged Trump not to end the program, which he is expected to announce Tuesday ― the deadline set for him by 10 state attorneys general who threatened legal action if he did not terminate DACA by that date.
Speaking about Dreamers, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) told The Washington Examiner Sunday evening “we ought to take care of them,” and it wasn’t their fault they had come to the country illegally.
“In any legislative fix, I would like to see them receive a green card,” he said. “We ought to recognize that giving them legal status has two problems. First, it creates a whole new class of people who will then be eligible for a green card and citizenship ― namely, the extended family members of those who will receive legal status who can, through chain migration, get legal status themselves.”
Cotton added such a program would also encourage more illegal immigration, a problem he said could be fixed by passing an immigration bill he and Trump both back that would make it more difficult to come to the U.S. legally. That bill would face heavy opposition from Democrats and some Republicans because it would slash legal immigration numbers. He also called for expanding E-Verify, a government system employers can use to verify the identity of job applicants.
On Friday, Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery (R), announced he would not take part in the legal challenge to DACA as he’d promised and called for legislation on Dreamers. Slatery encouraged senators to support the Dream Act, a bill that would provide a path to legal status for undocumented young people who came to the country as children, or legislation like it.
The Dream Act currently has bipartisan sponsors in both the House and Senate, but a majority of Republicans have opposed past efforts to get it through Congress since it was first introduced in 2001.
Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) also urged Trump not to end DACA.
“It is right for there to be consequences for those who intentionally entered this country illegally,” he said in a statement. “However, we as Americans do not hold children legally accountable for the actions of their parents.”
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said in a Monday statement he supported seeking a legislative solution to the plight of Dreamers, should Trump give Congress a six-month window to act.
“I have always believed DACA was presidential overreach. However, I equally understand the plight of Dream Act kids who ― for all practical purposes ― know no country other than America,” said Graham. 
Some Republicans are also pushing for the Recognizing America’s Children Act, or RAC Act, which they’re calling a conservative answer to the Dream Act. It similarly would allow Dreamers to receive legal status and eventually become eligible for citizenship, but would have narrower eligibility requirements. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) plans to introduce the bill in the Senate in the coming weeks; Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), a moderate member, has already introduced it in the House. It also has backing outside Congress: Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) came out in support of the bill last week. 
There are GOP members who would likely support legislation for Dreamers as standalone bills, without other conditions. But most have said they would only vote on bills that help undocumented immigrants if Congress first addresses border security or enforcement measures ― if they would vote for them at all. 
Democrats have previously supported bills coupling border security and enforcement with legal status for undocumented immigrants. But they’d likely only go so far ― Democratic leaders have dismissed an idea floated by the White House to protect Dreamers in exchange for slashing legal immigration numbers, funding Trump’s border wall and increasing other deportation efforts. 
Democrats have argued Dreamers shouldn’t be used as a bargaining chip, and young undocumented immigrant activists agree. That means Democrats and advocates may eventually be forced into a bind of their own over whether to sell out other immigrants to protect Dreamers. 
Standalone bills that support Dreamers could likely get enough support to pass, but that would probably require a large number of Democratic votes and a smaller proportion of Republicans. Ryan and McConnell would have to bring those bills for a vote for it to happen. Whether they want to remains to be seen. 
For all of the Republican opposition to DACA, it has saved them for five years from having to actually do anything to support the Dreamers they say should be helped. That might be why some of them didn’t want Trump to end it.
This story has been updated to include a comment from Sen. Lindsey Graham.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that House Speaker Paul Ryan did not allow a House vote on an immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013. In fact, that decision was made by his predecessor, John Boehner.

Global growth will barely be above three percent this year and unemployment is set to rise again.
Historic levels of unemployment that are already surpassing 200 million underpin a new risk as we face the very real possibility that these numbers are actually structural unemployment. 
Many European governments talk of large unemployment numbers as a ""new normal."" It should come as no surprise therefore that 68 percent of citizens in the ITUC Global Poll 2014 think governments are doing a bad job at tackling unemployment.
There is little recognition that this complacency from governments is about abandoning ambitions for full employment and building cumulative marginalization of both young people entering the jobs market and women and migrant workers with barely a foot in the formal economy today.
Then there is the desperation of the informal sector with no rules, no social protection and no minimum wages -- this is 40 percent of the global workforce and growing.
This complacency by governments who are cowed by big business and big finance means a cocktail of increasing inequality, joblessness and informality with little or no change in the volatility of the financial sector as serious financial regulation gets pushed into the medium term at best.
As the global labor movement meets in Berlin at the 3rd ITUC World Congress, we have some messages for entrenched business interests.
We will not abandon the next generation or their children. The dignity of work, decent work, is non-negotiable, and if governments can't or won't work to lift investment in infrastructure, the green economy and the care economy, then we will put our democracies to work and stand with our communities to change the economic model.
This has to be in the interests of sensible business when our global polling shows that one in two people have direct or family experience with unemployment and 82 percent of people say their wages have fallen behind the cost of living or remained stagnant.
And when nearly half of the world's population think it is unlikely that their children will find a decent job, this is not optimistic for cohesive communities or demand as the lifeblood of growth.
It has been extraordinary to see the governments in crisis countries go to war on their own workers -- collective bargaining slashed, wages attacked, jobs lost and severance pay and social protection eroded.
Despite the injustice of this, the total sum of the economy shrunk by these measures has had global impact and growth declined in in BRICS countries last year.
Is it any wonder that 78 percent of people think the economic system favors the wealthy? 
The trust in government all over the world has eroded. People know that governments are increasingly in the grip of corporate power.
When we see the global footprint of the American Chamber of Commerce -- they are everywhere peddling the impoverished demands of the anti-union American corporate model.
Moldova is probably the poorest nation in Europe, but the American Chamber is there and threatened capital flight if the government introduced a minimum wage. 
Their members refused join the global accord with IndustriALL and UNI in Bangladesh after the tragedy of Rana Plaza. 
And in the slave state of Qatar, they support the unspeakable actions of a government and blame workers themselves for the extraordinary number of worker deaths. These are workers who are forced to live in squalor, with poor food and who work long hours in extreme heat in a police state -- workers who are trapped in Qatar.
And now with trade agreements like the TPP, we are at risk of seeing the insidious investor state dispute mechanisms -- ISDS -- which allow corporations to sue government for so-called lost profit if they change regulation, improve workers' rights, if they protect and advance quality public services, if they protect the environment -- if they simply govern in the interest of their people.
I recently heard America's Goldman Sachs say American democracy was the ""best money can buy"". If you look at the amount of investment in the financial lobby at the European level and the influence of the global footprint of the American corporate model, the danger of the ""corporate parliament"" is spreading.
The world has to change, power needs to re-balanced and unions plan to give this a nudge on three major fronts.
We will see slavery ended. Slave states like Qatar, the wealthiest country in the world, cannot suck business and governments into their vortex with the mighty dollar such that they collectively remain silent about workers enslaved for the benefit of the rich.
We cannot sit back and watch workers in countries like Cambodia shot and jailed by government decree with support of local governments for striking to gain a minimum living wage of just $160 a month. Similarly, in Bangladesh, Indonesia and other countries, we cannot accept poverty wages in the supply chains of global corporations. For a few cents extra on garments or a few dollars extra on electronics all workers could earn a minimum wage on which they can live with dignity. We aim to see just that.
And there are no jobs on a dead planet. If our governments won't accept their responsibility to negotiate a treaty that will stabilise the climate, we will mobilise. The science is clear and we are out of time. We need to see industrial transformation now with a reduction in admissions and universal access to breakthrough technologies. 
We need to see a just transition with necessary finance to support vulnerable nations and vulnerable communities. 
There are jobs in climate justice, jobs for our children and grandchildren. Responsible business: it is time to step up -- because the profit takers in your midst are putting your sustainability and ours at risk.
The ITUC represents the largest global democratic community, and workers and their families expect better. We expect better of governments, and we oppose the corporate bullies that are driving inequality in their own interests. 
We are the voice of opposition, and we are the voice of progress. We share a common set of values that are founded in peace, democracy, rights, sustainability and social justice.
We are committed to building the power of workers to see these values centre stage.

658,POLITICS,"In An Award Show That Was So Much About Politics, Donald Trump Barely Came Up",Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-golden-globes_us_5a538a2ae4b0efe47ebb01ba,"At the Golden Globes, it was striking that the president was mostly a nonentity — unlike during last year’s ceremony, when he loomed large.",2018-01-08,POLITICS,"WASHINGTON ― Sunday night’s Golden Globe Awards was bound to feature political moments, with attendees turning the spotlight to sexual harassment and gender inequality in the workplace, both in society at large and within their own industry.
The theme prevailed throughout the night, both on the red carpet and during the ceremony itself, though with mixed results. 
Many Hollywood icons in attendance had previously not missed a chance to make pointed political remarks. One of the night’s nominated movies, “The Post,” was produced as a direct response to the president of the United States. So it was striking that Donald Trump was mostly a nonentity — unlike during last year’s Globes, when, on the eve of his inauguration, the president-elect loomed large.
That night, Meryl Streep memorably turned her speech accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award, the Globes’ equivalent of a lifetime achievement award, into a searing critique of Trump, which drew a response from him the following morning. Calls for diversity and inclusion and other references to Trump’s divisiveness came up during other winners’ speeches.
Fast forward one year, and Trump barely came up during Sunday’s ceremony — even though in so many ways, the #MeToo movement includes the president, who has been accused of sexual harassment or assault by more than a dozen women, bragged on tape about groping women, and unleashed a cascade of sexist and misogynistic attacks against his female opponent during the 2016 election. His victory inspired a groundswell activism by women, fueled by their rage.
Yet on Sunday, there were just a sprinkling of moments that seemed to pertain to the president, such as pledges to support the free press. 
“We know the press is under siege these days,” Oprah Winfrey, this year’s Cecil B. DeMille honoree, said in her speech. “We also know it’s the insatiable dedication to uncovering the absolute truth that keeps us from turning a blind eye to corruption and to injustice, to tyrants and victims, and secrets and lies. I value the press more than ever before.”
Meher Tatna, the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), announced that the group would donate $1 million each to the Committee to Protect Journalists and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
Thanking the HFPA while accepting her award for Best Actress in a Drama, Frances McDormand quipped, “Let’s face it, they managed to elect a female president. I’m just saying.”
The most direct references to Trump came during host Seth Meyers’ opening monologue.
Meyers recalled how instead of Trump, actor Seth Rogen used to be “the guy making trouble with North Korea,” referring to the regime objecting to Rogen’s controversial 2014 movie “The Interview.” 
“Simpler times,” Meyers said wistfully.
“Give it up for the Hollywood Foreign Press, a string of three words that could not have been better designed to infuriate our president,” Meyers continued, similar to a comment Streep made last year. “The only name that would make him angrier would be the Hillary Mexico Salad Association.”
Meyers also looked back on his infamous roast of Trump at the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Dinner, which the then-reality television star attended while promoting his unfounded conspiracy that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.
“In 2011, I told some jokes about our current president at the White House Correspondents Dinner, jokes about how he was unqualified to be president. Some have said that night convinced him to run,” he said. 
Turning to Winfrey, Meyers continued: “So if that’s true, I just want to say: Oprah, you will never be president! You do not have what it takes!”
He then told Tom Hanks that he would “never be vice president,” joking that the everyman actor is “too mean and unrelatable.”
“Now we just wait and see,” Meyers said.
Coincidentally, Winfrey’s rousing speech later in the night drew speculation that she could indeed run for president in 2020.
But others pushed back, noting that the lesson of the Trump era may not be to encourage a celebrity to launch a political career.

LOS ANGELES, Feb 15 (Reuters) - As the story of a little-known British World War Two code breaker gears up for the Oscars as one of the top nominees, ""The Imitation Game"" has found a larger cause to fight for the rights of persecuted gay men.
Nominated for eight Oscars on Feb. 22, ""The Imitation Game"" tells the story of mathematician Alan Turing, who worked with a secret group of government cryptologists during World War Two to break Nazi Germany's wartime code and saved countless lives.
Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, went uncredited for his work and instead was persecuted on charges of homosexuality, a crime in 1952, and died a broken man in 1954. He was posthumously pardoned in 2013 by Britain's Queen Elizabeth.
The film, distributed by The Weinstein Co, has sparked off a petition by the Human Rights Campaign, an organizing advocating for equal rights for the LGBT community, to pardon some 49,000 homosexual men charged under Britain's gross indecency law that was repealed in 2003.
It has attracted more than 330,000 signatures including Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley, who plays female mathematician Joan Clarke, as well as notable CEOs including Google's Eric Schmidt and Yahoo's Marissa Mayer.
""Alan's own treatment by history had been so unfair,"" said Graham Moore, Oscar-nominated for his ""Imitation Game"" script.
""We always hoped we could create a dialog around these issues of the treatment of gay men in society, about the historical persecution reaped upon them, and getting to be a part of these kinds of conversations is even more important.""
Made for a budget of $33 million, according to BoxOffice.com, ""The Imitation Game"" has grossed more than $155 million worldwide since its November release.
It earned Oscar nods for Cumberbatch, Knightley, director Morten Tyldum and the coveted best picture prize, where it will contend against frontrunners ""Birdman"" and ""Boyhood.""
Tyldum, the Norwegian director of 2011's ""Headhunters,"" said while Scandinavian filmmakers such as himself hone their talents on American genre films, they bring a fresh esthetic for underdogs such as Turing to Hollywood films.
""We're very skeptical of people who are too perfect. We like flawed people,"" Tyldum said. ""The more shaded, flawed characters that are struggling, I think there's something very relatable about that.""
Much of the film focuses on Cumberbatch's portrayal of Turing's nuances, vulnerabilities and strengths as an outcast among his peers.
Both Tyldum and Moore, who won best adapted screenplay at Saturday's Writers Guild Awards, faced initial concerns from film financiers that a film about an unknown historical figure who commits suicide would be marketable to audiences.
""I love when people say 'Imitation Game' is such a crowd pleaser,"" Tyldum said. ""Yes, it's a crowd pleaser but the guy kills himself. We've achieved something, it's a beautiful challenge.""
Moore said he relished the challenge of making ""an unmakeable project.""
""The whole goal of the film was to bring Alan Turing's story to a crowd that wouldn't otherwise have been exposed to his life and his work and his person.""

663,QUEER VOICES,Malaysian Newspaper Slammed For 'How To Spot A Gay' List,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/malaysia-newspaper-gay-list_us_5a81bb6ae4b08dfc93067b06,The article underscores the country's rigid stance on LGBTQ rights.,2018-02-12,VOICES,"A Malaysian newspaper has come under fire from activists after for a “how to spot a gay person” checklist it published last Friday. 
The Sinar Harian article said gay men like beards and mustaches, as well as wearing tight clothes to show off their “six pack” and going to the gym to check out other men rather than exercise, The Guardian reports. As for lesbians, they tend to hug each other, hold hands and belittle men. 
The article sparked instant controversy on social media and spotlighted Malaysia’s stance on LGBTQ rights. The Muslim-majority country has retained a colonial-era penal code that criminalizes sexual behaviors “against the order of nature,” which it defines as including homosexuality. 
Malaysian activist and social media personality Arwind Kumar blasted the article in a video that can be viewed below: 
“I’m not sure who wrote this article, but ... don’t try to be God. Take a step back down, take a seat back on your chair, do what you do and don’t do this, because there are much more important issues in this country that need to be addressed,” Kumar, who boasts more than 323,000 Facebook followers and 75,000 YouTube subscribers, said in the clip. 
He continued, “If you really want to educate society, then explain to them the traits of a pedophile, a molester, a murderer, a kidnapper ― those people who actually endanger the lives of another.” 
Others were similarly incensed by the article. 
Malaysia’s conservative views on LGBTQ rights have made headlines a number of times in recent years. Last spring, the release of Disney’s live-action “Beauty and the Beast” remake was delayed after director Bill Condon announced that the film would include a gay character ― LeFou, the goofy sidekick to villain Gaston ― for the first time in the company’s history.
Though Malaysian officials considered releasing an edited version of “Beauty and the Beast” with its “gay moments” removed, the movie arrived in theaters intact ― albeit with a 13-plus age rating. 
When Adam Lambert visited Kuala Lumpur as part of his Glam Nation Tour in 2010, the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party staged a series of protests outside of the concert, accusing the singer of promoting “gay culture” with “lewd dancing” in his performances. 
Lambert went ahead with the show, but agreed to “a few minor adjustments out of respect for the Malaysian government,” according to Billboard.

Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gallup-poll-older-gay-marriage_us_573f2c9de4b00e09e89ed37c,A Gallup poll found marriage equality support at an all-time high among the 65+ set.,2016-05-20,VOICES,"Nearly a year after the Supreme Court's historical ruling on marriage equality, support for same-sex marriage among Americans age 65 and older is at all-time high. 
A 2016 Gallup poll found that 53 percent of Americans 65 and older say they believe same-sex marriages should be recognized, with the same legal rights as traditional marriages. Although it's a 30-percent support drop from 18- to 29-year-olds, it's the first time since Gallup first polled on the issue in 1996 that the majority of older Americans said they think same-sex marriage should be fully legal.
Forty-two percent of the same demographic said they supported same-sex marriage in 2014, up from 14 percent in January 1996. 
The rise in support among older Americans is consistent with the statistics across the board. The poll, which was based on telephone interviews conducted earlier this month with 1,025 adults, found that 61 percent of Americans said they supported same-sex marriages, a slight increase from 60 percent last year. 
Gallup analyst Justin McCarthy said he believed that the strong support for same-sex marriage across the U.S. will have a major impact on the 2016 presidential election. 
""Americans' heightened approval of gay marriage this year makes the issue a fairly straightforward one for the remaining Democratic presidential candidates,"" he wrote. ""Not only do the vast majority of fellow Democrats agree with their stance, but they also have little to fear on the issue from the general electorate.""
While Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump has a checkered history with the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, McCarthy believes that his party's ""tapering opposition"" to marriage equality makes it ""an ideal climate"" for the GOP frontrunner. 
Pointing to Trump's recent attendance at a same-sex wedding, he wrote, ""This is a marked departure from his former primary rival, Ted Cruz, who said he'd never attend a gay wedding if invited.""

Gordon, who broke boundaries in 2014 as the first openly gay player in the NCAA, told Asbury Park Press, “I didn’t get a fair shot to show what I could do” in the NBA, claiming that “it was without a doubt because of the fact that I’m gay.” He also revealed that he hadn’t received a single tryout with an NBA team. 
“Nobody was calling,” he said. “Even after I went to the (Las Vegas) combine in July, I still didn’t get any feedback.”
Gordon, who transferred to Seton Hall, became the first openly gay player to participate in the NCAA’S March Madness. He told the paper that will now pursue a career as a San Francisco firefighter.
Gordon previously spoke out about the way that his sexuality has affected his career, saying that he encountered “blatant homophobia” in his attempt to transfer schools.
Homophobia continues to be a major issue in the sports world at large and while some progress has been made on some levels, the search for an openly gay sports superstar continues.

LOS ANGELES, Dec 31 (Reuters) - A gay Los Angeles couple plans to exchange wedding vows on a flower-covered float trundling through Pasadena during the nationally televised Tournament of Roses Parade on Wednesday, capping a momentous year for same-sex marriage in the United States.
The planned nuptials of Danny Leclair, 45, and Aubrey Loots, 42, who have been together for 12 years and own a chain of hair salons, will mark the first same-sex marriage on a Rose Parade float in the 125-year history of the annual event, organizers say.
But it won't be the only wedding ever to have been performed on one of the Rose Parade's flower petal-bedecked floats on national television.
Wednesday's planned ceremony was preceded by two heterosexual couples tying the knot during separate processions in 1989 and last year.
Leclair and Loots plan to make it official aboard a float shaped like a wedding cake coated in white coconut chips, accented with red kidney beans and festooned with 12,000 roses and other floral decorations, said Ged Kenslea, a spokesman for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.
The foundation is sponsoring the float to celebrate same-sex marriage and the role it can play in helping to reduce new HIV infections among gay men, he said.
Joining the couple for the parade will be a lesbian minister performing the ceremony and a lesbian couple, Sharon Raphael and Mina Meyer, who have been together 42 years and were legally married in California in 2008, Kenslea said.
He said the group planned to time the ceremony to be conducted at about 9:45 a.m. local time during the 15-second window during which that float is expected to pass before television cameras during the live parade broadcast.
Loots, who is originally from South Africa, and LeClair, a native of Canada, met at a Los Angeles nightclub and originally had planned for a relatively low-key wedding until the opportunity to exchange vows in the Rose Parade surfaced.
""For me, I was moved by the stand that the AIDS Healthcare Foundation was taking,"" Leclair told Reuters on Monday at a staging area where finishing touches were being added to the float in a large warehouse in Irwindale, east of Los Angeles.
Loots said he had been traveling when he got a message from his partner asking if he would want to get married on a Rose Parade float.
""I said, 'You're crazy! Of course, let's celebrate our love in front of the world,'"" he recounted, adding that the couple were also motivated by the chance to offer hope to same-sex couples who in most states are still denied marriage rights.
""Being on top of this cake floating down the road is truly for the men and women in the world that don't have these opportunities,"" he said.
Wednesday's event comes at a time of increasing momentum for the cause of gay marriage in the courts, at the ballot box and in statehouses across the United States.
As of this month, same-sex matrimony has been legally recognized in 18 states and the District of Columbia, with the tally more than doubling during the past year, due in most cases to litigation over the issue.
The trend has gained steam since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2013 that married same-sex couples are eligible for federal benefits, striking down a key part of the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act. (Writing and additional reporting by Steve Gorman; Editing by Eric Walsh)

John Fennell won’t be competing for Team USA at the Winter Olympics in February, after a freak accident in his World Cup qualifying run on Thursday ended his hopes.
The luger, who competed for Canada in the 2014 Olympics, had the fastest start of the day and was in eighth place headed to the final stretch when the runner on his sled snapped and fell off. Incredibly he still finished 21st, but only the top 15 qualify for Friday’s World Cup. That race will determine the U.S. Olympic team.
Fennell was one of five American men in contention for the country’s three Olympic spots, and he looked like a shoe-in for the final until the malfunction.
Fennell quickly took to social media to share his heartbreak:
 Heartbroken. Part of my sled broke off during my qualifying run, cutting my Olympic qualification. Seriously crushed to end like this. 
I can’t begin to imagine the emotions Fennell is feeling right now. It’s one thing to get beaten in competition, but to lose out on an opportunity because equipment broke is tough to take.
Fennell will forever be an Olympian — This doesn’t take that away from him. And his story and visibility have helped countless youth in sports accept their own selves.
Still, if you have a moment to give Fennell an e-hug, you can find him on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

What are the odds of a husband and wife both realizing they're gay at the same time without even talking to each other about it?,2013-05-04,VOICES,"Life sometimes presents the strangest coincidences. What are the odds of a husband and wife both realizing they're gay at the same time without even talking to each other about it?
In the spring of 2009, I experienced a profound personal epiphany, almost like Moses at the burning bush. For the first 50 years of my life, I had just assumed that I was sexually and romantically attracted to women. That meshed with my relatively conservative upbringing in a very conservative part of the country. I was born in a male body, so of course I assumed that I was male. I felt attraction to females, at least to some of them, so I went through the motions of being a straight man. I dated, starting around age 12, getting into allegedly romantic relationships with girls. But that spring in 2009, in a blinding, dramatic flash of personal insight, I realized that I'm actually attracted to men, and that changed everything!
Initially I was quite upset about it, and for about a day or two I was even willing to die if I could just die straight. I spent some time thinking about the revelation; I repeated the experience, with exactly the same result. I kept waking up every morning and finding that I was still gay. I began to think of the repercussions that would occur if I were to come out of the closet as gay. But after a few days I also began to see big advantages to this development. It would mean that I was free to act the feminine way that I had always wanted to act. (I had been forced to adopt a fairly masculine demeanor to fit into my ultra-conservative corner of the country.) Also, it would mean that my body's sexual response was perfectly normal and not as grossly aberrant as I had feared during some of my darker moments. Yes, there were a lot of advantages to this.
Ultimately, because of where I now live and work, I would encounter few problems in coming out. Sonoma County, about an hour from San Francisco in northern California, is a very open and accepting place for LGBT people, in stark contrast to the Midwest, where I grew up.
However, there was the sticky problem of my marriage. Cathy and I had been together for a total of 22 years and had a largely positive relationship. We loved and respected each other, and we supported each other through a lot of life's ups and downs. The physical side of our relationship had dwindled in recent years, but now it was obvious why, and now I took full responsibility; my body just wouldn't work that way anymore. What was I going to say to her? How could I possibly break this news to her?
A few days later, while I was stewing about this conundrum, the two of us were driving around, and she said, ""Let's stop and get something to eat. I need to talk to you."" I'm not sure what I was expecting, probably nothing really big. I had noticed that she'd gotten harder to live with over the previous months, so I thought that maybe she'd explain why. Or maybe she'd say something about our 12-year-old son.
""I'm really sorry,"" she said, biting her lip. I could tell that she was really nervous. Finally she said, ""I'm realizing I'm a lesbian.""
""What?! Get outta town!"" I exclaimed. I was dumbfounded. Then I dropped my own bombshell: ""I just figured out I'm gay!""
We both stared at each other in disbelief. Happy conversation followed, punctuated by laughter. We were both thankful to know that our news was not seen as bad by the other. I recall feeling very relieved. Since that conversation, we have stayed as close as we have always been as a married couple; we have been very supportive of each other. In some ways our paths have been very similar. I used to think that life was excruciatingly painful, but not anymore. Life is good now.
We've continued in support of each other, and we've even stayed legally married. We think it's funny that we're still married.
I think my feelings are predominately overwhelming feelings of relief. I can be me, who I really am, who I need to be, without causing serious pain to someone I love.
I think I do regret that it took me so long to see all this; it would have been nice to have figured it out sooner. That said, at least I figured it out. If we hadn't moved to the West Coast, I doubt any of this could have happened. I shudder to recall how painful my life was before coming out, and to imagine how bad my life could still be. I feel profound gratitude for at least being able to figure things out. Life used to be so painful, and I couldn't figure out why; now I know, and now it's better.
In the end I realized that I'm really a woman, a straight woman. The part about being attracted to men was correct; the assumption that I was a man was the error. I've begun my transition to living as a woman, and I am thoroughly, totally enjoying it.

I wanted to document my experience with becoming HIV-positive for a couple months, but had yet to find the words, or the cojones, to do so. Quite honestly, I wasn't sure I ever would. But here I sat, blurry eyed and bed-headed, feverishly regurgitating all of the words that came to me mid-snooze. 
I spent hours vacillating over whether I should share my story or not. Yes, I was scared of rejection. But I wasn't going to be afraid of being turned down by someone who was dumb enough to count me out before I even got in the ring. If being HIV-positive was going to cut my dating pool in half (as someone once told me it would), then those people were in the shallow end. I want someone that isn't afraid of the deep. 
And who knows, maybe some of my friends still wading around might venture into the deep end after reading it. 
As scared as I was of sharing my status, I couldn't imagine bearing the secret any longer. vulnerable as my story may make me seem, I was infinitely more vulnerable keeping it hidden. I had only disclosed my HIV status to a few people, but one of them had taken it upon his self to share my information with several others. I was outraged... panicked... and I wanted my power back. Damn it, I was going to get it. So I submitted my little story to a national publication.
Just one word... Panic.
A barrage of scenarios flooded my headspace. What if my ex-boyfriend sees it? Will my conservative family members say, ""I told you so?"" And worse, what if the next love I have yet to meet will no longer give me a chance?"" A cacophony of judgment grew steadily louder from people who were merely living in my imagination. The theoretical Greek chorus that often stops us from doing what we want to do.
Two words now... Screw them.
As gay men, we decided long ago that living out loud was the only way to truly respect ourselves. Yet so many HIV-positive individuals are forced to quietly murmur it under their breath, feeling guilt or shame that stems from prejudice within our own community.
So call me irresponsible or naïve, but I venture to guess that I was also in good company. My peers and I often held the belief that if we acted like straight people -- going on dates before sleeping together, protecting ourselves (almost) all of the time with the ultimate goal of a relationship -- things would all work out. 
 The old guard of gay activists experienced true horror, and were now hell-bent on carrying on the fear in hopes of finding a different outcome. For a period of time, this had impact. Unfortunately, this method is becoming less effective as more time passes. Indeed, a new approach to advocacy is needed.
I am tired of all of the fire and brimstone being touted from a generation disconnected from mine. I have my fair share of shortcomings, but I considered myself a pretty tough cookie to crack -- and I had crumbled. My generation was going to have to start baking with a new recipe.
The article was released. I looked closely, read the words, making sure I looked good in the picture, and finally closed my computer. Then I took a breath. For the first time since learning about my status, I felt clean.
I was just about to order my next self-congratulatory beer when I received the message that brought me to my knees.
""My first partner and I were together for just under 8 years before he passed away. He was positive and I maintained my negative status. He would tell me stories and show me pictures of his friends lost during the 80's and 90's. He was 24 years my senior and one thing he always made me promise was to protect myself no matter what, no matter who....
Reading your article, I couldn't help but cry. Then I went to his grave and read your story aloud... He would have been touched by it.... I still maintain my negative status today 5 years after losing him... But I just wanted to express myself and thoughts.... Thank you so much for sharing""
I felt unworthy of this man's story, but compelled to share it. This response wasn't intended for me. It was for those that have passed, but more importantly, for those who continue to experience heartache and sorrow from the loss of their loved ones. 
The stigma and fear attached to HIV may stem from fear of the unknown. But in the gay community, it stems from a fear of loss. The horrific stories aren't something from the past, they are living in the hearts and minds of many today. Older gay men reprimand my peers because they want to protect our hearts from the tragedies they have endured. Like any unruly child, however, we have a hard time listening.
I felt a sense of foolishness and stupidity for the words that I have written, but I knew they were authentic. Hopefully, my experience could bridge the gap between condemnation and conversation. Instead of preaching from the pulpit, maybe a new approach could work. 
As I stand outside of my second closet door, I realize that my fears of coming out positive stem from being scared not to love again consider myself the consummate clumsy romantic, and I admit that I was scared to lose that part of myself. Now, as I face the world sans mask, I can resume chasing after my next love song, because I am free to love myself again.

670,QUEER VOICES,A Mother's Personal Story About Her Trans Child and Public Bathrooms,"Janna Barkin, ContributorMom, trans ally, activist and consultant, yoga teacher, nature...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ill-go-with-you_b_8604466.html,"Our kid looked like he belonged in the men's room, but it is not okay in our society to take one's daughter into a men's room after a certain age. We were confused and so was our child.",2015-11-22,VOICES,"
How do you know which bathroom to use? 
For cisgender people this is a simple question to answer: You use the men's room if you're a man, and you use the women's room if you're a woman. (""Cisgender"" refers to people who identify with their birth sex.) But for transgender and other gender non-conforming individuals, just going into a public bathroom can be a challenging and even dangerous experience. 
There are many people who want to legislate which bathrooms people get to use. These bathroom police want laws that say a person's gender as recorded on their original birth certificate is the only basis for determining whether a person uses the men's room or the women's room. Such laws are discriminatory against transgender and gender non-conforming people. They also are a violation of privacy -- who's going to be checking?!
I am a mom to a transgender child. He is almost 18. His birth sex was female. (To be clear, I will use male pronouns for Amaya throughout this blog. Our family and community used female pronouns for Amaya until he asked us to switch at age 14.) His transition from female to male was gradual, starting when he was 3. He says his transition is ""complete for now."" 
When he was very young, bathroom trips with our little tomboy were easy. Either my husband or I could go into any bathroom with him. But as he got older, he began to look out of place in the women's room. 
In our culture it is acceptable for a parent to take a child of opposite gender into the restroom when they are very young. Tolerances shift around age 5 or 6, and certainly by age 9 children are expected to use the facilities that match their birth gender. Things can get tricky for children whose outward appearance or inner gender identity differs from the gender they were assigned at birth, and for their parents as well. 
Very early on, our ""girl"" looked out of place in the women's room. When I took Amaya to a restroom, it was clear many people were concerned. Some stared and whispered. I often noticed surprise and even shock on people's faces. I know they were thinking: there's a boy in the girls' room. I would even call out to my child, ""Hey girl, you can wash your hands over here,"" to subtly assure these people that everything was okay. I felt uncomfortable, to say the least. My child was well aware of the commotion and would hold my hand very tightly. 
My husband and I discussed our problem. Our kid looked like he belonged in the men's room, but it is not okay in our society to take one's daughter into a men's room after a certain age. We were confused and so was our child. 
Using the restroom at school caused anxiety that only increased as the years went by. Amaya would frequently have stomachaches. We realized he was not using the bathroom at school. When we spoke to the school about it, he was offered use of the office bathroom as an option. He didn't like doing that, as it made him ""different."" When he got older, he figured out that going during class made it less likely that there would be others in the bathroom. 
I remember the day Amaya took matters into his own hands. He was about 14, just beginning his transition, and we were on a family trip to New York. We were at a Broadway show and the bathroom lines at intermission were incredibly long. While standing in the line for the women's room, I looked over at the men's line and saw my husband -- and to my surprise, Amaya was in line just a few people ahead of him. Gabriel and I looked at each other in acknowledgment of what we were witnessing. This was our child affirming his gender as male. Amaya was looking forward and didn't notice us noticing him. 
No one else seemed to notice either. 
He had made a conscious decision to stand in that line. It was clear he felt more comfortable in the men's line. It was also clear that everybody else was also comfortable with him being in the men's line. Had my child been waiting in the women's line with me he would have only received confused looks and stares. Not one person in the men's line that day batted an eye.
Most individuals know instinctively which bathroom they feel is right for them, and they will choose the one that most closely corresponds to their gender identity. Denying a trans person the right to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity is an act of discrimination, one that can have devastating consequences. Social movements such as #wejustneedtopee and #Illgowithyou  have brought internet attention to the absurdity of laws that would force trans men into the women's room and vice versa. For photos click here.
Everyone goes. Everyone should feel safe when they do. 
It is a huge misconception that cisgender people are in danger from transgender, intersex, gender fluid, non-binary or other gender non-conforming people in public bathrooms. There is not one substantiated incidence of a trans person committing any type of crime against anyone in a public bathroom. In contrast, there are many documented incidents of violence against transgender people, especially trans women. Click here for the most recent statistics.
According to the National Center for Transgender Equality, only 17 states have laws that specifically prohibit discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation in public accommodations. Some cities and towns have similar municipal laws. It's a start but it is not enough. 
The Equality Act of 2015 is currently in Congress and supported by President Obama. This sweeping act would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to ban discrimination nationwide based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Please read about The Equality Act and consider contacting your local Congresspeople to encourage them to vote for it. Click here to view the document.

Until there is full protection under the law, if you are transgender or gender non-conforming and you feel unsafe using a public restroom I'll go with you.

Directed by Broadway veteran Andrew Keenan-Bolger, the video is intended as an informal thank you to supporters of Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS (BCEFA), which is dedicated to raising funds for HIV/AIDS-related causes across the U.S. 
Keenan-Bolger, who returns to Broadway next spring in the musical adaptation of ""Tuck Everlasting"" and is the co-creator of the theater-centric web series, ""Submissions Only,"" cited BCEFA's longtime support of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community as part of his incentive to helm the video. 
He was also instrumental in getting Creel on board for the project, which is the first live music video to be produced by BCEFA and features arrangements by music director Ted Arthur. 
""My joining in was simple,"" Creel told The Huffington Post in an email. ""Andrew called and said the words 'Broadway Cares,' and I just said, 'Yes!'"" 
He then added, ""What I love about being in the theater is the sense of family and belonging to a community that takes care of one another. We are made better by giving back.""
What a joy to see such warm sentiments expressed in music!

Indonesia has the world’s largest Muslim population but Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra, is the only province that enforces Islamic law and outlaws homosexuality.
Religious police and vigilantes in Aceh often raid homes and places of work and detain people on suspicion of engaging in homosexual activity.
Police in North Aceh district confirmed the raids and detentions of 12 transgender people after residents complained their children were being harassed, the national daily Kompas said.
“There were mothers who came crying to me, worried about their children,” said district police chief Ahmad Untung. “This is not right, and we hope this social disease can be resolved,” he told the paper.
The suspects were forced to cut their hair to look more “masculine” and were later released without charge, media said.
Rights group Amnesty International said the raid showed Aceh had become “an increasingly hostile place” for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community.
“The latest raids on beauty salons are just the latest example of the authorities arbitrarily targeting transgender people simply for who they are,” Usman Hamid of Amnesty International Indonesia said in a statement.
“Cutting the hair of those arrested to ‘make them masculine’ and forcing them to dress like men are forms of public shaming and amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, in contravention of Indonesia’s international obligations.”
Last year, the provincial and central governments drew international condemnation after authorities in Aceh tried two young men on charges of engaging in gay sex and then publicly caned them - the first such case in the country.
Indonesia’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community has drawn increasing hostility in recent years. Conservative groups and politicians have urged parliament to revise the national criminal code to criminalize same-sex relations.

674,QUEER VOICES,NFL Prospect Derrius Guice Says Team Asked Him If He Was Gay,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/derrius-guice-nfl-sexuality_us_5aa13dbae4b002df2c616f6e,"The former LSU running back said he was also asked if his mother ""sells herself.""",2018-03-08,VOICES,"The NFL is reportedly investigating claims that draft prospect Derrius Guice was asked about his sexuality in an interview. 
Guice, a former Lousiana State University running back, told SiriusXM NFL Radio Wednesday that a team at the NFL Scouting Combine asked him if he was gay. He also said they asked if his mother was a prostitute. 
“Some people are really trying to get in your head and test your reaction,” Guice said in the interview, according to USA Today. “I go in one room, and a team will ask me do I like men, just to see my reaction. I go in another room, they’ll try to bring up one of my family members or something and tell me, ‘Hey, I heard your mom sells herself. How do you feel about that?’”
The athlete didn’t specify which team asked him the questions, but said he was told to “come in prepared” for the combine. 
“You’re being watched and tested the whole time,” he said. 
Following Guice’s interview, NBC’s Pro Football Talk confirmed via a source with knowledge of the situation that the questions he referenced were indeed asked. 
The news was quickly denounced by the Human Rights Campaign. 
The Human Rights Campaign’s Ashland Johnson blasted the inquiries into Guice’s sexuality “as absurd and inappropriate” in a statement on the organization’s website. 
“Guice’s experience illustrates the risks faced by millions of LGBTQ people today in employment, athletics, housing and other areas of their lives,” Johnson, who is HRC’s director of public education and research, wrote.
A spokesman told Pro Football Talk that the NFL was “looking into the matter.”
“A question such as that is completely inappropriate and wholly contrary to league workplace policies,” NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Thursday. “The NFL and its clubs are committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all employees in a manner that is consistent with our commitment to diversity and inclusion, state and federal laws and the CBA.”
Unfortunately, Guice’s claims are not isolated. In 2016, New York Giants cornerback Eli Apple said the Atlanta Falcons asked him similar questions during an interview. 
“The Falcons coach, one of the coaches, was like, ‘So, do you like men?’ It was like the first thing he asked me,” Apple told Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia. “It was weird. I was just like, ‘No.’ He was like, ‘If you’re going to come to Atlanta, sometimes that’s how it is around here, you’re going to have to get used to it.’”
The Falcons’ head coach Dan Quinn later apologized to Apple, saying he’d spoken to the coach who interviewed the athlete and “explained to him how inappropriate and unprofessional this was.”
“This is not what the Atlanta Falcons are about,” Quinn said, “and it is not how we are going to conduct ourselves.”

To celebrate Valentine’s Day, GLAAD asked three of its campus ambassadors to recall their milestone smooches. In the video above, they describe experiences ranging from “very liberating” to “hilarious.” 
Rosemary Mulvey of New York’s Ithaca College says in the clip that her first kiss with another woman took place at a party.
“There was more to my identity than being bisexual or straight. I was actually a queer woman,” she says. “It was a pretty big wake-up call for me, because I realized that I really wasn’t happy in a relationship with a man.” 
The University of Washington’s Andre Menchavez felt similarly. 
“Being gay, for me, was always something that was seen as a question or a phase,” he says in the video. “But that first kiss really solidified that I was gay, and it made me comfortable with that label.” 
The average age for a first kiss among LGBTQ people is 17 years old, roughly two years later than heterosexual people, GLAAD points out. In other cases, young queer people may have been kissed someone before but find their first LGBTQ kiss to be a more important moment. 
“When their first LGBTQ kiss happens, it’s validation of all the time that went into feeling secure in their identity,” GLAAD officials wrote in a blog post. 
The video, released Wednesday, is part a new digital series called “amp” that is aimed at elevating LGBTQ youth voices.

The state Assembly passed Bill 2943 on Thursday. The legislation, which targets the practice of trying to change a person’s sexual orientation, now heads to the state Senate. If enacted, the bill would make “advertising, offering to engage in, or engaging in sexual orientation change efforts” to the list of fraudulent business practices already banned in California.
Assemblyman Evan Low, a leader of the legislature’s LGBT Caucus, proposed the bill.
“This is a very personal issue to me,” Low said before the vote on the Assembly floor. “This notion that we would accept as a legal practice that conversion therapy works is antithetical to my very existence in this body.”
Major mental health associations have thoroughly discredited conversion therapy. The American Psychological Association has said that attempts to change sexual orientation through therapy have “serious potential to harm young people.”
A 2012 law already bars mental health providers from attempting conversion therapy on minors, The Associated Press reported. Low’s bill seeks to offer consumer protections to adults who accuse people of defrauding them by advertising sexual orientation change efforts. 
Several Republican Assembly members were concerned that the bill would infringe upon the right to freedom of religion. They cited the ability of churches to sell books about conversion therapy, for example, or invite a therapist to speak about the subject at a church event. 
“This is a bill that would be overturned by a higher court on the grounds of the First Amendment,” Assemblyman Matthew Harper, a Republican, said.
Low said that the bill is limited to conversion therapy offered as a service in exchange for monetary compensation. He said it would not prevent people from speaking or writing on the subject, and it would not apply to the sale of books.
“You can still try to pray the gay away if you’d like, but it hasn’t proved to be effective,” said Assemblywoman Susan Talamantes Eggman, a Democrat who supports the bill. “To advertise that you can change someone’s orientation is simply that — fraudulent.”
The bill has the support of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the California Psychological Association, and civil rights groups like the Human Rights Campaign. Conservative religious rights groups, such as the California Family Council and the Alliance Defending Freedom, are opposing the legislation.
Low told California’s Assembly members on Thursday that he too had wondered if he could change his sexual orientation as a teenager. He said he ultimately suffered from depression and experienced suicidal thoughts.
“Growing up with so much hate, I too wanted to find out if I could be changed and if anything could work because of the societal pressures that we have,” he said during an emotional speech on the floor. “There is nothing wrong with me. There is nothing that needs to be changed.”
CORRECTION: A previous version of this story suggested incorrectly that Assembly member Evan Low was himself a survivor of conversion therapy.

678,QUEER VOICES,Is Denver The New San Francisco? Denver's PrideFest Makes You Think So,"Mark A. Thompson, ContributorA member of SATW and New York Travel Writers Association, Mark...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-denver-the-new-san-francisco-denvers-pridefest_us_5949bc8ce4b0710bea889a59,"Though Denver is the nation’s 19th most populous city, its annual PrideFest is the third largest Pride festival in the nation.",2017-06-21,VOICES,"It’s possible that Denver has become the 21st-century equivalent of San Francisco in the Sixties: a utopian vison where the default setting is a blissed-out optimism about the future.
Nearly 400,000 people attended this year’s Denver PrideFest, the city’s annual two-day celebration of Pride that transforms Denver’s Civic Center Park into a kaleidoscopic mash-up of Woodstock and Burning Man. For as far as the eye could see and the telephoto could capture, Denver’s vast Golden Triangle of culture was a sea of happy people surfing the chilled groove and cheering for entertainers who included Jennifer Holliday, Peppermint, and Chad Michaels. 
“I remember my first PrideFest and just being so overwhelmed by the spectrum of humanity and the rainbow of our community,” says deejay Alyson Calagna of Remix Your World who moved to Colorado six years ago. “From baby dykes to bears, the entire gamut of humanity and everyone so colorful and expressive and unique. It’s everything.”
One of the fastest-growing cities in the States, Denver is in the midst of another construction boom. According to the Denver Post, the city’s latest population surge, which commenced in the 1990s, has been driven by millennials who comprise more than half of new residents. 
“I wanted to see the sky, but I still wanted a city with a metropolitan feel,” says Calagna. “I’m originally from Louisiana and when I moved out here, it felt like home again. People are so friendly. You talk to strangers, the people in line at the grocery store. To have all that in a progressive city, I have just embraced this community more than any other place. It’s such a conscious city. A forward-thinking, conscious city.”
Colorado’s legalization of marijuana in 2014 has resulted in cannabis tourism, with Denver hosting a smorgasbord of recreational and medical cannabis dispensaries. To step into this world of edibles, topicals, extracts, concentrates, and proprietary strains is to recognize how quickly the blissed-out future has expanded.
Soon after I landed in Denver, I heard from several friends back East, millennials who texted “Why didn’t you tell me you were going to Denver? I love Denver”—which reminded me of the wanderlust inspired by San Francisco in the Seventies.
More than a thousand newcomers arrive in Denver each month, which has helped make Colorado the second-fastest growing state in the US. “We’re really glad you’re here, but just don’t stay too long,” joked the concierge at the Art Hotel. 
Regarding Denver’s welcoming spirit, Jayne Buck, Vice President of Tourism at Visit Denver, says, “It doesn’t matter if you’re a grandma or a twenty-something, the city is open to difference and new perspectives. What I hear most often from people who come here is, ‘I feel at home.’ In either 24 or 48 hours, they tell me, ‘I feel at home here.’ I think it starts from the Gold Rush, that sense of seeking an adventure, embarking on a new chapter, and then finding yourself in the process. You take on a new skill. It’s a place where people are encouraged and allowed to be themselves.”
Though Denver is the nation’s 19th most populous city, its annual PrideFest is the third largest Pride festival in the nation—which says a lot about Denver’s LGBT community. According to Rex Fuller, Vice President of the GLBT Community Center of Colorado, “Denver has a real live-and-let-live attitude; LGBT folks feel comfortable here. We held our first Pride event 42 years ago.”
“We appreciate the individuality of people,” says Buck. “We really embrace that—and the LGBT community is something that inspires all of us because of what they have had to overcome. I think it makes you want to be more accepting.”
PrideFest is the largest annual fundraiser for the Center, which has served the LGBT community since it opened in 1976. One hundred percent of PrideFest’s proceeds support the programs and services of the Center, a non-profit organization whose mission is to empower, engage, enrich, and advance the LGBT community of Colorado. 
As Fuller attests, “Denver is the largest metropolitan area in this part of the country, so we serve as a hub for rural areas of Colorado and neighboring states—we have the same draw for isolated LGBT folks that other urban cores have. People come here to find acceptance and to build a community.”
Under the umbrella theme of Viva La Vida, nearly 200 organizations marched in the 42nd annual PrideFest Parade, which traversed a 1.5-mile route from Cheesman Park along Colfax Avenue to Denver’s Golden Triangle. At Civic Center Park, more than 250 vendors offered a plethora of rainbow accoutrements. 
According to Buck, “The common denominator throughout Denver is that it’s open-minded and welcoming to new perspectives and the ability to integrate them. There’s an entrepreneurial spirit and the sense that you can be who you want to be and that spirit is infectious and contagious. It’s relaxed, but at the same time, it’s energized.” 
Denver’s erstwhile mayor, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper addressed the Pride Rally for Equality, reminding the audience of the importance of voting and of Colorado’s ongoing commitment to equality. 
“Denver’s LGBT scene is so diverse,” says Calagna. “We have One Colorado, and there’s a huge lesbian scene between Denver and Boulder, and we have all the greatest deejays—and DragNation and Tracks. You ask any of the queens from RuPaul and they’ll tell you, DragNation is the greatest show in America. The scene, the crowd, the diversity. It feels old school and yet still very modern. What can I say, Denver is the shit.”
The future is coming, in spite of the current Presidential administration’s desire to turn back time—and, more than ever, the future looks like Denver.

679,QUEER VOICES,A Mom's Letter Introducing Her Transgender Daughter,"Liz Hanssen, ContributorWriter, editor,  parent",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-moms-letter-introducing-her-transgender-daughter_b_6151766.html,"I am the fortunate parent who lives in awe of her 15-year-old child, whose courage and conviction to live authentically in a largely unfamiliar and often less-than-friendly world is humbling. And as she has grown into herself, so too have those around her.",2014-11-15,VOICES,"Dear family and friends,
Many of you already know that, over the past year, my youngest child, who has been known to us all as ""Jon"" since birth, has been questioning, exploring, and, more recently, affirming her gender identity. (Yes, I have used the female pronoun here correctly. It turns out that for all these years I was using the wrong one. My bad!) What my child has come to understand is that she is transgender and identifies as female. She has chosen to call herself ""Elana,"" a name she feels more aptly reflects the person she knows herself to be.*
I realize that some of you might not be familiar with the term ""transgender"" or what it means to live as a transgender person. I have learned that a full understanding can be both deceptively simple and extraordinarily complicated at the same time. Thinking back to the moment of Jon's birth 15 years ago reinforces this observation. Toward the end of my labor, my husband and I experienced some moments of terror when the monitor showed a slowing heartbeat and the doctor declared, ""We have to get this baby out."" I remember hunkering down into a primal space and pushing for dear life, and although I did succeed in pushing this baby out, the room was leaden with silence as we all waited for that first cry of life, which was notably, frighteningly absent. When the wail came, the room seemed to explode with a palpable measure of joy. This is the simple part: I had birthed a healthy baby.
What followed is what follows the natural sequence of all births: the proclamation of the baby's sex -- in our case, a boy! Within seconds of the birth, everyone in the room had begun making and acting on assumptions about the significance of our child's genitalia. Since our baby quite visibly had a penis, we did not give the matter a second thought, and we forged ahead along the gendered path before us, as we had with our three older children, and as our parents had done when raising us. On a very basic level we assumed that the genitalia wholly determined the gendered direction of our child's life, and we also assumed that our child's identity would naturally align with maleness.
So here is where it gets more complicated. Most children are born with a penis or a vagina (and some are born with genitals that don't fall neatly into either category). For the majority of children, the brain and the body will match; that is, the interior -- the brain, or neuroendocrine system -- will work in tandem with the exterior, the physical body. These children will typically grow up aligned with the gender assigned to them at birth, and they will be comfortable in their skin, so to speak. For other children, the brain/body relationship is differently matched, complicating the relationship between the two. This can simply mean that that an individual with male genitalia knows herself to be female, and another with female genitalia knows himself to be male. (There are many other variations along the gender spectrum, which I will not go into here, but I would be happy to point you in the direction of more in-depth information, should you wish to learn more.) And now back to the simple part of this story and the most important truth of my life: I gave birth to a healthy baby, a human being, not a prepackaged promise of a predictable gendered life. 
And now I am the fortunate parent who lives in awe of her 15-year-old child, whose courage and conviction to live authentically in a largely unfamiliar and often less-than-friendly world is humbling. And as Elana has grown into herself, so too have those around her. I have watched our family's love deepen as we've traveled alongside Elana on her journey. I have seen the care with which our friends have made the switch from male to female pronouns and from ""Jon"" to ""Elana"" without blinking an eye or missing a beat. I have watched our community -- neighbors, teachers, doctors, nurses, and, yes, even police officers -- unequivocally agree to see and address my child as the person she knows herself to be. I have been blessed to see humanity outshine ignorance again and again. 
I am writing to you today to thank you for being a part of this amazing community we are fortunate to call home, and to ask you to join us in using the name ""Elana,"" along with her chosen corresponding pronouns, ""she"" and ""her.""
Much love to you all, L.
*I have used the pseudonym ""Elana"" to protect my child's privacy.

681,QUEER VOICES,"At Midlife, Let Your 'Cougay' Come out!","Joe Kort, Ph.D., ContributorPsychotherapist, Certified Sex and Relationship Therapist at J...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/at-midlife-let-your-couga_b_7548454.html,"Embrace being a Daddy or a Cougay! It's a big world out there, and someone will find you attractive, your accumulated experience valuable, and your personality charming. Having father energy and playing with it can be very fun.",2015-06-10,VOICES,"As a therapist, I see many gay male clients who are struggling with middle age. As a middle-aged gay man in my 50s, I understand the struggle. When I was a younger therapist, older gay men in their 40s, 50s and 60s would tell me they disappeared at gay events, and that other gay men--particularly younger ones--didn't notice them. I didn't believe them. I told these men that life was what you make of it, and if they were invisible we needed to discover what they were doing to make that happen. 
As I approached my later 40s, and now my early 50s, I see exactly what they were talking about. I have literally been standing in a bar behind younger guys who turned around and bumped right into me as if I wasn't there. Heads don't turn toward me the way they did when I was younger. As one ages, one notices these things. 
I once told a gay male client in his 20s who was struggling with not feeling attractive that he was, in fact, a very handsome and hot guy, and that we needed to work on his self-esteem. I immediately followed this by reassuring him that I was not coming on to him. He responded, ""Why would I ever think you were coming onto me?"" That is when I realized he didn't even see me as a sexual being. 
American culture worships youth and beauty, and this is even more so in the gay community. Historically when gay men reach a certain age, they tend to withdraw from the dating and bar scene, from interaction with younger men, afraid that they will no longer be seen as attractive, or as predators. 
Unfortunately, the striving for a younger body and stronger libido is leading to an alarming trend I am seeing amongst middle-aged gay men: the use of crystal meth. This is not the answer. There are far healthier ways to retain a sense of virility, attractiveness and relevance. 
Perhaps one of the saddest examples of gay middle-aged self-loathing was the Manhattan therapist Bob Bergeron. A handsome, successful man, Bergeron was weeks away from having his book, ""The Right Side of Forty: The Complete Guide to Happiness for Gay Men at Midlife and Beyond,"" published. As a man approaching middle age myself, I looked forward to the book. I watched his videos, and wanted to learn what someone in my own field and dealing with my impending issues could teach me about it. 
Then he committed suicide. I was horrified. Apparently, Bergeron found the prospect of becoming middle-aged unbearable and isolating.
This is exactly what should not happen, in my opinion. Separation of old and young in our society is increasingly understood as undesirable and unhealthy, leading to isolation and to the detriment of both groups. Due to the devastation that AIDS wreaked in the gay community in decades past, there is a notable lack of older gay role models from whom younger men--and other middle-aged men--might benefit from knowing and interacting with. 
Cougays
I am proposing we begin using the word ""Cougay,"" the counterpart of labels given to women--""""Cougars""--who have enjoyed the benefits of staying relevant and sexy. In fact, becoming a Cougar has been called a source of self-empowerment. We gay men are also capable of being vibrant, alive, and remaining attractive and alluring. Younger gay men sometimes call us, ""Daddies,"" a label I personally enjoy. There are even some websites already established for Daddies and their admirers, one being www.daddyhunt.com. However many peers and clients my age don't like that label, as it reminds them of their age. 
So what better word to claim than Cougay?
Personally, I am working on owning the Cougay label. Despite the fact that I have been in a solid relationship for 22 years now, I still want to be seen as vibrant and attractive by others. Don't we all? I am still an individual, and enjoy flirting and playing with sexual and flirtatious energy. So I work hard to lose the extra weight that age often brings, and I seek out younger people to be a part of my life. 
I challenge my clients to work on staying in shape through exercise and eating well, but also to remain involved in the gay social scene, to be out among younger people. Many people have noted that having younger friends makes one feel younger. And if they are rejected or made to feel invisible, I encourage them to not take it personally, to not neuter themselves or give up on their sexuality, and to not be offended by younger guys who might call them ""Daddy."" 
I challenge them to keep dating, even though it gets harder when you are older, especially in the gay male community. This calls for consistently changing your dating strategies, as well as your expectations. For instance, in dating it is important to notice how you are dressing. You don't have to be making a fashion statement, but keeping up with various clothing options that make you feel better about yourself keeps you confident, and other gay men will see this. 
I suggest that they enjoy the freer sexuality that comes from getting older. Things that you thought you could never do before, or would never have had the nerve to try, you find yourself willing to try. Try experimenting safely with other sexual ways of being that don't only involve erections. Sex can include fantasy, role-play, and kink. 
So, embrace being a Daddy or a Cougay! It's a big world out there, and someone will find you attractive, your accumulated experience valuable, and your personality charming. Having father energy and playing with it can be very fun. I have always been drawn to paternal men, and have had a need for their blessings. Now, as an older man, I enjoy offering younger gay men the blessings derived from the wisdom I've gained over the years, and the things I can say and do to help them feel better and confident about themselves. 
Cher was interviewed a few years ago, and was asked when she thought enough was enough given that there were newer and younger divas coming up behind her. She said that in the old days the older divas got out of the way and made room for the younger ones, and that she had no intention of doing this. She said they would have to go around her! I loved it. I feel the same way as a middle-aged gay man.

Fred was planning to hold a press conference at the host hotel to announce his ""seriously considering"" intentions of running for president as an openly gay candidate.",2012-02-25,VOICES,"This is the fourth installment in a series of stories about my experience on the campaign trail with Fred Karger, an openly gay candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.
The first Mormon girl I ever met, I married. Her name was ""Janet,"" and we were summer camp counselors together in college.
Janet and I were J-High leaders, which meant we had the unenviable task of entertaining groups of precocious 12- to 14-year-olds. I shaved my head and ignored them, while Janet was her peppy, wholesome self. We were a formidable team and sealed our partnership for one of the staff's notoriously racy theme parties.
Janet was Hera to my Zeus, and our station was ""Hedonism of the Gods."" She may not have inhaled, imbibed, or otherwise ingested, but she sure could give one heck of a back rub!
* * * * *
I hadn't actually encountered Mormonism until college. The first time I laid eyes on the temple on Stanford Avenue in Palo Alto, I remember thinking, ""Good for them!"" The name ""The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints"" implied an outsider quality that appealed to me for obvious reasons. Lord knows my own Catholic faith hadn't gotten Jesus right. Maybe these Mormons with their latter-day saints were doing a better job?
So I kept an open mind, even when Utah kept popping up while shooting a video about reparative therapy for George Michael. Michael had read an article an acquaintance of mine, Tomas Mournian, had written called ""Hiding Out."" It was about underaged kids living on the street after escaping from mental hospitals, where they'd been sent by their parents to be cured of their homosexuality. He wanted to showcase the issue in his set at the Equality Rocks concert during the Millennium March on Washington for LGBT Rights in 2000.
The stories of 3:00-a.m. abductions, locked mental wards, razor-wire fences, and electroshock therapy the kids shared with my camera overwhelmed me. While I continued exploring the subject in MTV's I'm Coming Out, it wasn't until Reed Cowan and Steven Greenstreet's 8: The Mormon Proposition that I saw the subject addressed with the honesty it deserved. Reed, a former Mormon, and Greenstreet courageously and accurately lay the blame for the lives of collateral damage these kids endure where it belongs, on the doorstep of Salt Lake City's Temple Square.
I myself had not been up to that task. I had made a rule of unquestioningly extending to any marginalized group the same unconditional acceptance I was seeking as a gay man. I perceived the Mormons, not to mention African Americans, to be such a group.
All that changed in 2008.
* * * * *
Like many in the LGBT community, I was intensely invested in the outcome of Proposition 8. Since 2004, I had been making, and still am making, a marriage equality documentary called Justly Married, and I was anxiously reading every new poll and projection.
So was Fred Karger.
Fred hadn't missed a beat since saving the Boom. He was now tracking the divisive ballot initiative as only a former political operative could, and he was not a happy camper. When the money started pouring into the ""Yes"" campaign that August, he was the first to sound the alarm, and with Brian Wilson, the only one to uncover the source of most of those funds -- Mormons.
So when he told me two years later that he was thinking of running for President of the United States, I knew what was up. The penetrating beam he had focused on the tax-exempt Mormon's illegal backing of a political measure was arcing straight for the Republican frontrunner, the Mormon Mitt Romney. ""Getting the Republican Party out of the gay-bashing business"" is how I remember Fred putting it, which sounded good to me.
But it isn't that simple.
* * * * *
Running for president is the birthright of any natural-born American, and as such, I believe it carries its own set of responsibilities
There's a fine line between vision and vanity. I wouldn't call Fred Karger vain; expedient, perhaps, opportunistic, or self-absorbed -- he's definitely a ham -- but he's also loyal, generous, and a friend.
There's also a fine line between vision and naïveté, or ""lacking in sophistication,"" as my seventh-grade homeroom teacher put it to my mom in a parent-teacher conference.
Mrs. Capozzi's assessment of me was fittingly based on my performance in a mock presidential debate. It was 1976, and Jimmy Carter was challenging Gerald Ford for the presidency. My ""sophisticated"" classmates argued that because neither candidate was sufficiently inspiring, it was appropriate for people to register their displeasure by not voting. I disagreed, countering that it was our duty in a democracy to vote, even if it meant writing in a third choice who had no chance of winning. Mrs. Capozzi exasperated my mother by telling her that she didn't think I was equipped to navigate my life with the same kind of aplomb my peers were able to employ and was worried about the quality of my future success.
On the specific point of voting, Fred and I undoubtedly agree. My parents are from the Greatest Generation, and the struggle to guarantee voting rights, whether for women or African Americans, was a significant part of their life experience, and they instilled the sanctity -- some would say ""holiness"" -- of the vote in their children. Fred's currency as a political strategist is the vote, and he has a reverence for it that goes hand in hand with that significance -- so much so, in fact, that he was beside himself when the gay establishment didn't make an effort to reach out to register any new voters during the protests that rallied Los Angeles after Prop. 8's passage. (Where you and I might see marauding youth, Fred sees voters lining up at the ballot box.)
But on other matters, well, call me naïve, unsophisticated, or René Descartes, because I believe that anything I can think is possible. To me, hope, or, more accurately, desire is not a luxury; it's an essential part of creation. It's not enough just to talk about wanting something; one has to believe that whatever one is wanting is actually possible, because desire without belief is hopeless. But, desire with belief? That changes the world.
Fred does not share this outlook, and this fundamental difference in philosophies would uncoil over the coming months to become our snake in the grass -- an inescapable divergence of beliefs that, whether in the cornfields of Iowa, thy ivy-covered halls of Dartmouth, or the headlines of the Los Angeles Times, would inevitably rear its head and send Fred and me in opposite directions.
* * * * *
But that was for another day, because it was it was April 2010, and I was on my way to New Orleans for the Southern Republican Leadership Conference.
Fred was planning to hold a press conference at the host hotel to announce his ""seriously considering"" intentions of running for president as an openly gay candidate, and he wasn't getting any cooperation from the conference organizers. If the Log Cabin Republican Dinner in L.A. had been the belly of the beast, this was going to be the fire that was going to roast that beast, and I was looking forward to the sizzle.

They were all going to be there, too! Sarah, Mitt, Newt, Ron, even that washed-up, anti-gay former Senator from Pennsylvania, Rick Santorum, made more famous for the ""frothy mix of lube and fecal matter"" that a Google search of his name brings up than for anything he had actually accomplished while in Washington.
If Bette Davis had been with me, she would have warned me to fasten my seatbelt. I did the next best thing: I wiped my camera's lens clean and charged up all my batteries.
Fred Karger was about to declare the opening of a new chapter in American history.

""The Prancing Elites Project"" follows a group of queer, black, gender non-conforming individuals from Mobile, Alabama as they navigate the nuances (and dangers) of being queer in the deep south while coming to live as their authentic selves.
Made up of Adrian Clemons, Kentrell Collins, Kareem Davis, Jerel Maddox and Tim Smith, ""The Prancing Elites Project"" is a bold and powerful look at a group of queer people who are thriving in a part of America traditionally considered extremely homophobic.
""We are a black gay male and gender non-conforming dance team from Mobile, Alabama, and we're fabulous!"" Clemons told The Huffington Post. ""We were rejected in high school from auditioning for the dance teams, so we came up with our own group called The Prancing Elites. Here in Mobile, we struggle with a lot of discrimination because of who we are and what we do. Basically we stand to let everyone know it's OK to be who you are, and to feel comfortable in the skin you’re in. Also live your life for you, because honesty starts within yourself! We, The Prancing Elites, live to BUCK another day!""
The group also emphasized that they want viewers to not only take away a sense of their lives as The Prancing Elites, but to also to feel inspired to live authentically as themselves.
""Watching this show, I want people to feel empowered to do anything that they put their minds to,"" Maddox told The Huffington Post. ""I want people to understand that no matter who or what you are, we all have an opportunity to be great just by being alive. Never let society tell you what you 'can't' do just because you're 'different.' Different people create different changes and sometimes being different is GOOD! BE YOU!""
""The Prancing Elites Project"" will premiere on Tuesday, Jan. 19 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Oxygen.

685,QUEER VOICES,What I Learned From Reading the Comments Sections,"Martie Sirois, ContributorTGNC advocate, founder of S.E.A.R.CH., mom of 3, www.gendercre...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-i-learned-from-reading-the-comments-sections_us_5873a081e4b08052400ee44d,Judgment and hatred are alive and well but voices of love far outnumber the hate.,2017-01-09,VOICES,"A friend recently told me, “Your latest article showed up in my Facebook feed - I loved it! But, I made the mistake of reading the comments section... Yikes.” 
I’m a blogger and op-ed writer. I write essay-style, non-fiction pieces pulled from my every day life experiences and opinions. (Note that I used the words blogger and op-ed writer, not journalist, not novelist, not poet laureate.) I write opposite the editorial pages. And I write on polarizing topics like LGBTQ+ issues, gender, racism, and white privilege. You can find my work here on Huffington Post, here on Scary Mommy, and also here where someone wrote about me, here on The Good Men Project, here at Red Tricycle, and here with the NBC Today Parenting Team, to name a few.
Sometimes, I scroll through my social media feed and I am suddenly caught off-guard seeing my own words in syndication, like this: 
This was a piece I originally published on my personal blog here, which got republished by Scary Mommy, and then again by Huffington Post Parents, and then promoted on their Facebook Page. Sometimes friends reach out to me, if I don’t see it myself, and tell me where else my writing has appeared. And that’s when they usually tell me, “the comments section made me so mad that I had to leave.” 
What they’re concerned about is the level of criticism, ignorance, and hatred that is freely regurgitated in the comments section following op-ed pieces on media outlets such as The Huffington Post. Maybe you’ve visited. Maybe you’ve piped up here and there in comments sections. Maybe you’re a “career” debater among comments sections, someone who places value and takes pride in starting or winning internet arguments.
I will admit that when I first began having pieces published, I read the comments. I mean, it was informative, free advice that gave me insight into my audience. But after a while, the comments sections became identical to one another. They were the same, mundane, oblivious, hate-filled comments that tend to perpetuate the cycle of ignorance. I was no longer getting anything out of reading them, so I quit reading them altogether.
I primarily write about being a supportive parent to a gender creative boy. I write in hopes of educating people about this unique and awesome population of people. Gender creative people are not some new phenomenon. They have been around forever. In Native American culture, they are called two-spirited people, and are the most revered members of the tribe. The only thing new is that parents are more accepting of it now. That’s because we learn from history, and history has proven that forcing someone to be someone they’re not never has a good outcome, and often leads to self-destructive behaviors and even suicide.
I could’ve easily chosen to keep my thoughts and opinions on my own blog, or in a series of tweets or Facebook statuses, but that would merely be an echo chamber, and I’d only be preaching to the choir and spinning my wheels. I needed to take these thoughts elsewhere and expose other people to the narratives of marginalized people – like the LGBTQ+ population that now includes my son.
These thoughts in print don’t go over very well with the masses. But, as with all change, pain comes first. So the fact that there were so many comments of hatred, and that I wasn’t simply getting positive feedback in a resounding echo chamber, I knew that my work was serving its purpose. And no matter how mean-spirited the comments, there were twice as many people who took the time to hunt me down and send me messages of support and love. 
The negative comments and hatred tend to live only in the comments sections (some of the worst offenders being those in parenting forums), because it takes literally no effort or talent to sit at a computer screen and, behind a presumed veil of anonymity, spew your most vile, hateful, intolerant, bigoted thoughts and criticisms. What actually takes courage and effort is writing and publishing a misunderstood, controversial topic and associating your real name with it. So I applaud all of you in this arena who are doing this much-needed work. 
I noticed that also, the people who really want the author reading their comments will actually do some research, and attempt to find out how to get in touch with the author. 99 out of 100 times it is those people who send meaningful messages of support, like these:
I definitely received plenty of hateful comments, and every imaginable variation of them, to the point of predictability. I’m a person who loves lists. So for the sake of posterity, I’m picking the top ten most repeated negative, uninformed comments I got. I answered all of them over time, and yet, the same comments kept popping up whenever I wrote a new piece. So, I no longer read them, but I’d be willing to bet you those comments are still being typed every day. Here were the top 10 most unoriginal, over-repeated comments I always got:
1.) “This mother should be prosecuted for child abuse.” I always found it interesting that someone could think they were qualified enough to make that judgment call based off of one 3-minute article captured from one moment in my life.
2.) “This mother is forcing labels on her child and screwing him up.” Actually, it was my child who, after years of feeling tormented and confused about why he couldn’t mesh with other little boys, identified himself with this label. It was me who had to accept that, not vice versa.
3.) “I’m so tired of all these labels. Why can’t people just be?” I don’t know about others, but my son took great comfort in finding a label that fit him. Plus, it had the added benefit of giving him a retort to all those kids who called him “gay.” He isn’t sexually identifying yet, so “gay” is not an accurate label right now. This gave him the ability to tell them, “I’m not gay. I’m gender creative, let me explain the difference to you.” Winning, teachable moment. If that’s what labels can do, then I’m all for them. By all means, if you don’t want labels on you, that’s totally cool too. But this is what works for my son.
4.) “Gender Creative? Oh my God. Are you telling me I have to learn yet another adjective for special snowflakes?” No, I’m not telling you that you have to do anything. Although, you might want to, given that the world is moving swiftly in the direction of gender diversity acceptance. You might want to catch up, for the sake of your future grandchildren. (With regard to the “special snowflake” remark, I will refer to something a friend of a friend posted on social media earlier today: “Would you rather be a unique snowflake, individual but with cohesive power to create beautiful expanses… or a turd to add to another big pile of sh*t?”
As a side note, many people read my pieces and somehow thought I made up the term gender creative. I certainly did not. The term was coined by a prominent developmental and clinical psychologist, Diane Ehrensaft, Ph.D.
5.) “This mother should just accept the fact that her son is gay.” Well, if and when he comes out, I will. He’s not sexually identifying yet. The following three are completely separate, independent things, having no bearing on each other: gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation. Any recently published book by respected researchers, clinicians, and psychologists will explain this in great detail.
6.) “This mother is making her child bully bait.” My son was already bully bait, before he self-identified as gender creative. Because he has always acted more feminine, has always enjoyed the company of girls more than boys, and is drawn to all feminine things (including toys, clothing, games, shoes, decor, etc.), he has always been picked on. All of his life. He knew no other reality. In fact, as soon as he had a label other than “sissy,” that was the moment he stopped being bully bait and was able to educate and enlighten others whenever he felt like it.
7.) “This mother is looking for validation and attention. She needs to put her foot down and be a PARENT!” Ok, for the first part of that statement, I knew this topic would be controversial, and would most likely not bring me any love at all, so I was surprised when it actually did. I was never looking for validation or attention. I’m looking to spark dialogue (which I have done). I’m being an advocate. With my son’s full consent, I first went public with my writing about him at the end of his 4th grade year. He wanted his story told. I decided that my writing about him would be my advocacy for him. I knew that a larger audience than my own echo chamber needed to hear this message.
The second part about “being a parent?” What they mean when they say “she needs to put her foot down” is actually, “she needs to stifle her son’s true personality and force him to live as someone he is not so that everyone else will be comfortable with him.” Well, that’s just not how I roll.
8.) “This mother needs to be preparing her son for the real world where people get bullied and teased all the time for being different!” Well, again, being bullied has been his entire life experience so far, up until recently. And what you’re advocating is called victim-blaming. There is no situation in life that bears bullying people. Secondly, it’s a good thing I put action behind my words, and created a group for all gender variant kids that is now an official program of the LGBT Center. My son has found his tribe of people with this group. So regardless of how cruel the world may be, I have well-prepared my son with a safe loving home where he can always land, and a community of like-minded friends. Thirdly, we need to be preparing our kids to not be bullies in the first place.
9a.) “This child will need lots of therapy one day.” Don’t we all.
9b.) “This child will be thoroughly embarrassed when he’s older.” Aren’t all kids thoroughly embarrassed of everything when they’re teenagers? I should know, as I have two teenagers in addition to my younger son. But actually, to answer the question, I do not think he will be embarrassed later by being in the spotlight now. First, he has loved the spotlight. Second, we’ve raised him to not be ashamed of himself for who he is, so he has no reason to be embarrassed in the first place.
10.) “Creating new labels like this just make our society more divisive!” Actually, it’s quite the opposite. Kids like my son stick out like a sore thumb. He’s going to get labeled regardless. Why not let him be in charge of the label? And, him giving a positive label to himself has actually made his friends at school become more inclusive of him, because they finally understand what he stands for and who he is. Refer back to #3 and #4 for more.
As much as we like to say we don’t need labels, just try living without the status of “male” or “female” for a while. See how many ID forms, doctor’s intakes, and job applications you can complete that don’t ask whether you are male or female. This box or that. Either or. Black or white. Hispanic or non-hispanic. Our world tries to live in binary terms, but truthfully, we’re not binary.
One last, bonus comment I will address is this one: I’m frequently told by “religious conservatives” that God created man and woman only. I like to remind them that yes, God created opposites like night and day. But He also created dawn, dusk, sunrise, twilight, sunset, and everything in between. Yes, God created birds of the air and fish of the sea, but He also created lizards, turtles, sea snakes, and frogs; emus, penguins, ostriches, and flamingos, and everything in between. Just look around and you’ll see that this world was never meant to be exclusively binary.
What I learned from reading the comments sections was this: judgment and hatred are alive and well, no doubt. But the voices of love, acceptance, and reason by far outnumber the voices of hatred. Those are the messages that contain unique, personal material and actually make their way to me. I keep them in a file on my desktop. I receive more every day, from people all over the world. There are too many to count.
So, about the comments sections, friends, I’m saying here and now: please don’t feel that you need to alert me to the horrible comments sections of articles, whether the article was written by me or someone else. Trust me, I know they’re there. I just don’t read them anymore. And you shouldn’t either.

688,QUEER VOICES,A Special Gift From My Grandmother,"Eric T. Shoen-Ukre, ContributorFundraiser, Blogger, Photographer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-special-gift-from-my-grandmother_us_585f1259e4b014e7c72edcf1,I don't have to leave David somewhere or make him hide when Grandma visits.,2016-12-25,VOICES,"My grandmother on my father’s side worked very hard for her entire life. She worked multiple jobs to make sure that her 8 children had food, clothes, and opportunities. My grandfather also worked multiple jobs including working many years at Alcoa. They were married for 56 years before he passed away over a decade ago from complications from Alzheimer’s. 
If you are a regular reader, you know that I got married this past summer. It was a small wedding and we were trying to keep things low key. That didn’t work, so we went full public with our response. I purposely didn’t invite extended family to my wedding. My siblings were the blood relatives that attended along with one cousin and one aunt who I count among my closest and most supportive family.
Although I have not hidden my sexuality, at the request of my family, I’ve been very evasive when I visit my small home town. Until I met my husband, David, I never brought anyone home for any family event, homecoming, or holiday. In fact, I was the only “single” family member and frequently got the sofa in my family’s small home at the holidays. 
At Thanksgiving, I received a box of Christmas ornaments and decorations from my grandmother. She is downsizing and doesn’t want them thrown away. Included with them are things that I gave to her or my grandfather over the years. 
Along with the box came a lovely note from my grandmother. I’ve never officially come out to her. Although I have aunts who have had “special friends” for many years, I wasn’t sure how to tell her myself. I know through stories in my family that she was aware that I was gay, but we just avoided the topic. I was evasive when we visited and used gender neutral pronouns when speaking about my dating life. 
In the note at Thanksgiving, she mentioned that although she doesn’t have a computer, use the internet, or check out “the Facebook,” my aunt Debbie told her about my wedding. Gram mentioned that she missed hearing from me. To be frank, I hadn’t written to her since meeting David other than a Christmas card the year before. Prior to meeting him, I would try to write once every month or so. 
David has become such an important part of my life that I couldn’t figure out what to write without including him in any note to her. 
After reading her note, I decided that it was time to bite the bullet and just tell her. No more hiding. I sent her our Christmas Card with a note inserted. 
The gist of the letter went something like this:
Dear Gram,
I apologize for not writing sooner. Things are going well for me in Brooklyn. Yes I did get married this summer. I kept the wedding very small and only invited close friends, mom and dad, and my siblings. I wasn’t sure how you felt about me being gay or gay marriage. I know that it isn’t the most comfortable thing for mom, dad, or our family. I married a Nigerian man in Rochester. I’ve decided that regardless of what other people think, I need to live my life for me, and not them. David is a social worker and he models part time. I’ve taken up photography outside of work and frequently go with him to shows. I’ll try to be better about writing more often. I sent your Christmas gift directly from the company and you should get it soon. 
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
Love,
Eric
I also included my new last name. I put a stamp on the letter and was shaking when I dropped it in the mail. How was she going to react? What would mom and dad say when they found out I told her. I know they are both still learning to accept who I am. 
Well, Gram didn’t disappoint. I got a letter back from her shortly after. 
Dear Eric and Friend,
First I received your two packages on Friday, December 9th. I haven’t opened them as I don’t open my gifts until Christmas. Thanks very much. I hear from you more often than I hear from my grand children close by. Anthony calls about every two weeks and came to see me when he was up in October for a wedding. 
As I don’t have a computer, don’t do email, facebook, etc. I heard about your wedding from Aunt Debbie who saw it on Facebook. Your mom hasn’t mentioned it. One day when your dad came alone we had a little visit. He seems to take everything in stride and doesn’t get too concerned with things that he can’t change. 
So many things have changed in my lifetime of 85 years and can’t imagine the ones to come. Grandpa and I were married 56 years when he passed away 11 years ago. God created us all different and some things are harder to accept. 
Things here are fine and I count my blessings and am thankful for my family and friends each day. 
I’m still playing cards Monday, shuffle board on Tuesday, and of course the dance twice a month. I went on a bus trip to St. Catherine’s Ontario to see an Irish singer. Yesterday I went to Morrisburg to see a play with 45 on a bus. 
It’s snowing here 3” so far so I moved my car about 8:00 a.m.
With love, Happiness, and Prayers, Gram
p.s. - Thanks again. 
I’m not sure how I can describe in words how that made me feel. I’d like to say that relieved was the first emotion that came over me. I also teared up a little. I know that my life isn’t easy for some people to understand, especially people who grew up in small towns far from cities that are not very diverse or accepting of people who may be different. Just seeing a letter addressed to “Dear Eric and Friend” brought tears to my eyes and a little belly laugh. My dear aunt who passed had a “friend” for many years who she lived with. We love that “friend” who is still an important part of our family. 
I’m also glad that now when I go to visit my parents, I don’t have to leave David somewhere or make him hide when Grandma visits. Our family photos that include him can be sent to her too. All of this has been causing me stomach aches since I met him. My siblings, too, have not been sure what to do. We always take a family photo and send a copy to Gram. 
I hate to lie. I hate to hide. Now it can all be in the open. 
So that was my Christmas gift from my grandmother. I hope that you all have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I’m off to Christmas Eve Service.

Upon hearing Ben Carson, the touted archangel of the archconservatives, proclaim that being gay is a choice, a fact illustrated by all those straight men who turn gay in prison, I couldn't help but envision SNL's Kenan Thompson getting up as Carson and saying, ""Being Ben Carson is a choice, a fact illustrated by all those smart men who turn into creationists shortly after joining the Republican Party."" A retired neurosurgeon, Carson abandoned his area of expertise to pursue a career that isn't exactly brain surgery.
In an effort to stave off accusations of homophobia, he recently found it necessary to invent a pseudoscientific basis for his distorted perspective. Qualifying his antediluvian worldview with a syllogistic fallacy, he proposed that since straight men often supposedly turn gay while being in prison, one can conclude that being gay is something one chooses, and that it is further correct to infer that all gay men have consciously made a similar choice about their sexuality at one time or another. In the resounding words of big Ben, ""[They] go into prison straight, and when they come out, they're gay. So did something happen while they were in there? Ask yourself that question."" 
Personally, I don't believe it's necessary to ask myself anything of the sort. In fact, it makes about as much sense to ask Carson's question as it would to ask if men with muscular physiques have criminal minds just because most men look very buffed up after a period of incarceration. Applying Carson's winning formula to other areas of human behavior makes for wonderfully colorful and cost-efficient research. To find out whether or not celibacy is a lifestyle choice, one could, for example, simply examine the behavior of a person marooned on a desert island. If the person isn't happy, then all celibates must be fooling themselves into thinking they are alone by design. 

Although it may come as a shock to Carson, most people are in precisely the type of gender relationship they had been drawn to from early on -- born to be wild, mild, straight, gay and often ""getting bi with a little help from our friends."" The fact that these dynamics may alter in prison says more about the restrictive setting than about those who are forced to be there. No one disputes that besides genuinely gay prisoners and some who come out, there are also heterosexual prisoners who settle for gay companionship while incarcerated. Similarly, we should recognize that in repressive theocracies it is often the opposite that holds true: Under these circumstances, vast numbers of gay men and women are forced to turn to heterosexual relationships out of fear or simply for the sake of solace. Imposed constraints can alter natural desires. People make do, often settling for less. Whether love wrought under dire circumstances lasts once those constraints are removed is an entirely different matter.
As the reputed Republican Hopeless for the 2016 presidential election, Carson takes every opportunity to congratulate himself on his ability to speak his mind at any cost -- the cost in this case being the reinforcement of an utterly nonsensical and dangerous notion, but the cost in all cases being rationality and someone else's well-being. Although Ben plays the ""bad boy"" iconoclast card on a regular basis, he is very careful never to step outside party lines. His anti-politically correct posturing is not only overtly political in nature but is about as correct as most opportunism: right for himself and those who finance him.
As a rags-to-riches success story, Carson has been getting away with incendiary comments for quite some time. While many of us may have been taught that kids say the darndest things, we often forget that very accomplished adults are often capable of saying the dumbest things. Having compared Obamacare to 9/11, recent Democratic initiatives to slavery, and the president's vision to Mein Kampf, the good doctor seems to be on a roll. It's not hard to imagine just what kind of surgery Carson would recommend for our nation in order to save it from deadly cancers like same-sex marriage and equal opportunity. 
In case the day should come when, in our fear, we do sign a consent form empowering someone like Dr. Run-Ben-Run Carson to lobotomize our democracy, well, not to worry, we'll still have those other geniuses to run to. I think they used to call them rocket scientists.

On Monday, the Assembly passed a resolution that declared August 2016 as Muslim Appreciation and Awareness Month, as part of an effort to acknowledge the “myriad invaluable contributions of Muslim Americans in California and across the country.” 
The resolution (HR-59) was introduced by Assembly Member Bill Quirk and passed with bipartisan support, according to NBC. 
The writers of the resolution pointed out that California is home to over 240 mosques, more than any other state in the country. The resolution also decried the discrimination that Muslim Americans have had to endure in the years following the September 11 attacks. 
“Muslim Americans have made contributions to education, science, entertainment and medicine both nationally and globally,” Quirk told NBC News. “Unfortunately, the Muslim community has been, and continues to be, the target of harassment, discrimination and assaults.”
The Huffington Post’s Islamophobia project, which has been tracking anti-Muslim incidents in The United States, has recorded 233 Islamophobic incidents in 2016 alone. Three of these took place in California this past July, including one instance where a mom wearing a hijab was reportedly attacked and egged while walking out of a Walmart in San Leandro.
“During these difficult times of increased anti-Muslim rhetoric and hate incidents, Assembly member Quirk’s resolution and recognition of Muslim Americans is uplifting for our community and immensely appreciated,” said Basim Elkarra, Sacramento Valley Executive Director of the advocacy organization Council on American-Islamic Relations. “It is truly a historic moment for all Californians.”

Today, the Catholic bishops have a chance to back down from the culture wars they started. The question is: will they?",2014-11-12,RELIGION,"
This week, the U.S. Catholic bishops are gathering in Baltimore for their semi-annual meeting. It's the first gathering of the U.S. prelates since the Catholic Church's rocky Extraordinary Synod on the Family and a chance for the bishops to demonstrate that they have heard Pope Francis' calls for a more inclusive church that's more concerned with the pastoral than with the rulebook.
Francis has acknowledged that the church's leaders became ""obsessed"" with imposing strict rules ""related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods"" on the faithful to the detriment of the church. But the impact of the hierarchy's obsessions go beyond the church and affect us all. In fact, while the culture wars are usually attributed to the Christian right, the U.S. Catholic bishops are in many ways responsible for starting the culture wars that have polarized society and paralyzed our political process. 
It was, after all, the Catholic bishops who created the ""right-to-life"" movement in the first place, back when most American weren't even paying attention to the abortion issue, as I detail in my book Good Catholics: The Battle over Abortion in the Catholic Church. In the mid-1960s, abortion wasn't a major political issue. It was regulated by the states, most of which banned it except to save a woman's life. But public health officials, doctors and some legislators began pushing to make abortion more widely available because some 1 million illegal procedures were being performed every year. The gynecological wards of many city's hospitals were filled with women suffering from botched procedures -- some 10,000 in New York City alone in 1967 -- and only women who were rich or well-connected could get legal abortions, even in cases of rape or fetal deformity. 
But the Catholic bishops, who considered sexual morality their special purview, decided to make preventing any liberalization of abortion law the main cause of their newly formed National Conference of Catholic Bishops. When California considered a bill to liberalize abortion access, the Dioceses of Los Angeles hired the same political consulting firm that got Ronald Reagan elected governor of California to beat back the bill. The bishops' consulting firm created the first grassroots ""right-to-life"" group to lobby against the bill. 
After that, the NCCB hired a political consultant to create right-to-life groups around the country. The bishops provided the financial and administrative support to get some of the earliest and most influential anti-abortion groups, including those in New York, Pennsylvania and Michigan, off the ground to obscure their involvement in the campaign against abortion, which they feared would reawaken old fears of the Vatican trying to impose its doctrine on American society. They created and funded the National Right to Life Committee, which would go on to be the most influential anti-abortion organization for 30 years, to coordinate the activities of the local anti-abortion groups. 
Most of these early groups were heavily Catholic. But as more Evangelical Christians became interested in the issue, they became concerned that the bishops' control of the NRLC would dilute the effectiveness of the pro-life movement because it would be seen as tool of the Catholic Church. At a heated board meeting just before the Roe v. Wade decision, they wrested control of the organization from the bishops' conference, obscuring the Catholic roots of the organization and the anti-abortion movement.
Having lost their grassroots lobby just when they needed it most, the bishops tried another tack. In 1975, they released the Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities, which said abortion was the number one issue for Catholics, and laid out a plan to organize Catholics politically to support candidates who backed a constitutional amendment to ban abortion. The move politicized the issue in a presidential election cycle in which both Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford thought they needed the Catholic vote to win. Both candidates went to the bishops seeking their blessing as the press watched breathlessly. Not surprisingly, the bishops gave what was widely viewed as their endorsement to Ford because of his support of an anti-abortion amendment.
So by the mid-1970s, the bishops had created the anti-abortion movement out of whole cloth and become the first to politicize the issue in a presidential election (even though they failed to throw the election to their preferred candidate). Four years later, when Republican strategist Paul Weyrich was looking for an issue to unite socially conservative voters into a new Republican electoral coalition to replace the fading New Deal coalition, he decided abortion was the perfect wedge issue, both because it tapped into conservative dissatisfaction with the new, socially liberal culture and because it could potentially separate Catholic voters from the Democratic Party. Weyrich rebranded the bishops' right-to-life movement the ""pro-family"" movement, teamed up with direct mail wizard Richard Viguerie and televangelists Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson to form the Moral Majority, and the culture wars were officially born. 
Four years after the Moral Majority got Ronal Reagan elected, when Walter Mondale attempted to unseat him, the Catholic bishops returned to abortion politicking. New York Archbishop John O'Connor declared that a Catholic ""in good conscience cannot vote for a candidate who explicitly supports abortion."" When Mondale selected Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate, hoping to draw Catholics back to the Democratic Party, O'Connor attacked her for supporting abortion rights. He accused Ferraro of misrepresenting Catholic teaching on abortion because she had signed a cover letter for a briefing by the organization Catholics for a Free Choice asserting that there was a plurality of Catholic opinion and teaching on the morality of abortion.
With that, the issue exploded in an election year. Catholic politicians were forced to defend their positions. Bishops and archbishops weighted in pro and con. Cardinal John Krol pointedly gave the invocation at the Republican convention. ""Nuns for Ferraro"" signs sprouted at Ferraro rallies. Abortion, according to the New York Times, was now a ""profoundly divisive"" issue in American politics.
In response, a group of some 100 Catholic priests, nuns, theologians and prominent lay people placed an ad in the New York Times asserting that a ""diversity of opinions regarding abortion exists among committed Catholics"" and ""a large number of Catholic theologians hold that even direct abortion ... can sometimes be a moral choice."" 
The ad, which ironically ran 30 years to the week that the family synod met in Rome, marked a turning point for the church. With its authority on sex-related issues openly challenged, the Vatican fought back, launching a crackdown against dissent that continued until the election of Pope Francis. 
Today, the Catholic bishops have a chance to back down from the culture wars they started. They could declare a truce in the costly and increasingly pointless war against the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate and stop equating emergency contraception with abortion, which even the Catholic Health Association admits is untrue. They could signal their willingness to welcome LGBT Catholics, as progressives suggested during the family synod, by backing down from their harsh rhetoric against same-sex marriage. They could retract their unfounded assertion that the ACA contains an ""abortion surcharge."" It's clear the bishops can take action right now to help end the culture wars and move the country forward. The question is: will they?

During a parliamentary committee hearing on Tuesday, The Anglican Church leader joined a long, distinguished list of people who have blasted the presidential hopeful for his promise to ban Muslims from entering the United States and build a wall between at the Mexico border if elected president.
Following a question by Chuka Umunna, a Labour Party member of parliament, Welby said he agreed with Pope Francis's earlier comments on Trump's campaign. “A person who thinks only about building walls wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not a Christian,” the pope said in February.
Umunna also asked the archbishop whether he believed “that treating a whole faith group as suspect and banning them from entry into your country is a Christian thing to do?”
The archbishop responded, “It’s certainly not a Christian thing to do, nor is it a rational thing to do.”
As head of the Church of England and the world’s Anglican community, Welby represents 85 million Christians. With his comments, Welby drew into question how a self-proclaimed Christian can propose policies that seem to directly contradict the Christian ethos.
Others have questioned Trump's religiosity given the aggressive, belligerent nature of his campaign, which has failed to resonate with many Christians. In February, evangelical newspaper The Christian Post published an editorial calling Trump a ""scam"" and urging evangelical voters not to support his campaign. 
""Trump claims to be a Christian, yet says he has never asked for forgiveness,"" the editors wrote, referencing comments the businessman has made in several interviews.
Even ultra-conservative commentator Glenn Beck agreed, saying on his radio show in March: “No Christian, no real Christian — I don’t mean a judgmental Christian, I mean somebody who is living their faith — no real Christian says, ‘I want that guy, that guy is for me.'""
Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.

694,RELIGION,"Ignore Convert Craziness and Oppose ISIS Ignorance, Because Canada Is Islam","Dr. David Liepert, ContributorRetired Canadian Muslim Leader, Spokesperson, Author and Educator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ignore-convert-craziness-_b_6296678.html,"Because Muhammad spent his life fighting against everything ISIS stands for, and he would have loved Canada.",2014-12-11,RELIGION,"The demands of radicalized converts like John Maguire -- who now goes by the moniker ""Abu Anwar al-Canadi"" -- that Muslims should attack Canada demonstrate his pathetic ignorance of the religion of Islam, the example of Muhammad and the nature of Canada.
Because Muhammad spent his life fighting against everything ISIS stands for, and he would have loved Canada. In fact, Canada's multicultural ""just society"" represents the highest aspirations of Muhammad's city-state of Medina, and Canada's egalitarian values align perfectly with the highest values of Islam. 
And it's not just Canada that's true of either: a recent review of 208 nations world-wide confirms that you need to search through the top 32 ""Western"" nations before you come to a purportedly ""Muslim"" State that actually represents ""Islamic"" values.
Instead, the religion of Islam has been suborned to political purpose by Middle-East strongmen -- most of whom were imposed by outsiders -- for decades, and following in their footsteps the Islam of political organizations like ISIS and those like them is a politically manipulated Islam. Converts like Maguire have been manipulated by the political imperative of ISIS and the other groups promoting so called ""radical Islam"", spoon-fed a mixture of hate and mis-information about both religion and politics, and have been turned into nothing more than disposable weapons. 
Thank God it hasn't always been that way, and it's still not that way for most converts. When I became Muslim 20 years ago, I was welcomed into a Muslim community whose main attitude towards me was hospitality, and alongside them I learned an Islam based on the Quran and Muhammad's example rather than any sort of an ""approved"" doctrine. Honestly, that was what attracted me to it: I had left Christianity not because I'd become unhappy with what the Bible said, but because I had realized that -- in my opinion -- Christianity had replaced following Jesus with worshiping him. So from my perspective I actually followed Jesus into Islam, and I have stayed Muslim because Muhammad took that inspiring Judeo-Christian religious foundation, corrected a few mistaken misinterpretations, and translated it all into a real and functioning multicultural and multi-religious society. 
In brief, in my intensive search through all our world's religions -- trying to find one that had remained completely true to their original revelation -- I learned that every one of God's prophets has promoted a ""just society"" for all that society's members, rather than just one world religion.
And while Muhammad was alive -- and for a scant few years after he died -- that was exactly what the first Muslims maintained in Arabia, until they lost it. 
As a Canadian Muslim, I rejoiced to realize that we'd rediscovered it in Canada, and Canada's other Muslims celebrated that alongside me: in fact, they all agreed that that was one of the main reasons they had come to Canada in the first place.
Bottom line, Muhammad's Islam is the cure for ISIS, but Canada is the cure for ISIS too.
So what do converts need to know about Muhammad and Islam?
First and foremost, learn your religion for yourself: if you are ignorantly following another person --even if they assure you theirs is the most perfect Islam-- then you are a fool, because following other people into destruction is mocked again and again in the Qur'an. Don't be an idiot: if it looks wrong, it is wrong. You can't serve God by doing evil in His name. If anybody tells you you have to change your name, change your language, disrespect your culture, your friends or your country, or disrespect women or other religions to be a good Muslim, they are lying to you. Please, check it all out for yourself, because everything I am writing is a matter of easily accessible record. And remember, God is The Most Gracious, and The Most Merciful: God will forgive you your sins and put you back on the straight path, you only have to ask. 
Because the world God intends is a world of peace. When Muhammad (peace be upon him) could have done anything, when he had an army behind him full of devoted followers willing to die at his command, he took over Medina and then Mecca and promulgated a constitutional accord that granted equal access to justice and all the protections of his ""Islamic"" state to Muslim and non-Muslim alike. He even promised those protections to non-believers.
He promoted women's rights, and religious equality for all, and he made those promises binding on the Muslims who followed after him to the end of time.
He fought for a world where Islam was allowed, not imposed. And once he'd won it, he promised religious freedom to all others regardless of their faiths, and even welcomed Christian worship into his own Mosque when necessary, not because he approved of their doctrine, but because he valued religious freedom and every person's right to celebrate God's ultimate goodness together --sometimes despite the different ways we understand it-- first. 
And he didn't hate Jews either. In fact the majority of Jewish tribes in Medina remained welcome there until long after he died. The famous falling out with the Banu Nadir, Banu Quynuqa and Banu Qurayza wasn't over religious matters, it was because they betrayed their own government, in much the same way that converts like Maguire are betraying Canada today. Two tribes accepted Muhammad's judgement and were exiled for their crimes --while still being allowed to take their wealth and their families with them--, while the Qurayza rejected Muhammad and demanded Jewish justice, which they got from their self-chosen judge Sa'd just as Sa'd had promised, imposed straight from the pages of Deuteronomy, rather than from Muhammad and the Quran. 
They condemned themselves and their families and died for their pride, not Islam. It was all about politics back then, just like it's all about politics today: Israel's Zionism and Palestine's Islamism have little to do with either Judaism, or Islam. 
Muslims are not allowed to hate, kill, oppress, rape, coerce or harm others, and any Muslim who does any of those things will face God's wrath on Judgement Day. Rather than Islam and Muslims, what ISIS is actually fighting for is a set of pre-Islamic practices including misogyny, racism and a near worshipful reverence for masculine honor that Muhammad called ""The Jahiliyyah"", meaning ""The Days of Pre-Islamic Ignorance.""
Muhammad warned Muslims that ignorance would return to threaten Muslims and Islam eventually, and it has.
As promised, that ignorance threatens converts with death and damnation, threatens the Middle East with war and destruction, and threatens our entire world with fear, harm and confusion.  And so in response, opposing ISIS and all those like them for the sake of our combined Islamic and Canadian values of egalitarian justice and freedom -- the true values espoused by Muhammad and his first and best followers -- is what Muslim Canadians should be doing, for the sake of Canada and for the sake of Islam.

What will they say about you?
Growing up watching her show, I always admired her spirit, spunk and upbeat attitude towards life. This afternoon, I gained a deeper appreciation of the power of Mary’s smile. It is one thing to smile when the world seems perfect and all is right. It is another thing to find a reason to smile when you stumble yet somehow find the strength to move onwards and upwards. Mary Tyler Moore was noted as saying, “You can’t be brave if you’ve only had wonderful things happen to you. Take chances, make mistakes. That’s how you grow. Pain nourishes your courage. You have to fail in order to practice being brave.”
Over 25 years ago, I learned the meaning of being brave and learning how to smile again.
I remember the moment as if it was yesterday. More than twenty-five years ago, sitting in DeKalb General Hospital in Atlanta next to my mother as she lay in a coma, I sensed this would be my last time in her physical presence. For the first twenty years of my life, she taught me, cared for me, loved me, and motivated me. I couldn’t believe the reality we all faced. I felt the touch of her hand and offered her a kiss on the forehead. I looked at her, once so full of life and now barely holding on. I remember feeling such sadness and despair.
How could this have happened? How would we survive as a family? All I felt was the world caving in and a darkness enveloping me. I began to cry from the depths of my heart. The January day was cloudy and cold, as if the world mourned with me. I struggled to find an anchor, some ray of hope, some way to be able to move forward. My universe was upside down. My mother had died, and although I was surrounded by family and friends, I felt all alone.
In retrospect, I understand now that those days were a crucible of my faith. As a young boy, I believed in a higher power but was never before challenged to muster such strength. To this day, I remember making a choice: I could either believe my mother’s untimely death was an accident and reject God or I could choose, in humility, to accept a higher plan and harness all of my inner strength, the resources of my faith, to carry mother with me in soul and spirit, and grow from this dark time in my life. I chose life and renewed my faith. I learned how to smile again.
As a rabbi, father, husband, teacher, and friend, I realize that every day I’m faced with a choice to sit in the darkness or light a fire. We all are. My crises may no longer, thank God, be existential, but we all choose between despair and hope, regret or resolve, stagnation or growth.
Just as God proclaimed “Let there be light” in the midst of chaos and darkness at the beginning of time, we must confront moments of personal chaos, darkness, and spiritual stagnation and choose to instill our lives with clarity and light. We’re tasked with the mission to find faith and see the light, and to pass the light to others. You’re alive today for a purpose. Don’t lament days lost but seize the moment now to make the best of today.
“Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year.”
Ralph Waldo Emerson
I credit my mother and father with instilling within me a can-do approach to life and the value of positive thinking. I learned not only from their words but their deeds as well. As parents, our children learn from how we respond to setbacks. Do we blame others for our disappointments or as my father always says, “When one door closes, another door opens.” My mother’s motto, when asked how she was doing no matter the chaos in the house—“Thank God, I am fantastic!”—lifted my spirits and buoys me up to this day.
I’ve also discovered that when you offer positive words to someone else, when you give someone a needed emotional boost, you yourself are uplifted. People will often ask me how I’m able, as a rabbi, to give people comfort in times of grief and tragedy. They ask, “Isn’t it emotionally draining? What do you say when you walk into a house of sorrow? How do you comfort the bereaved?” I know that I can’t provide answers to why something has happened, but I can provide strength and hope. From my heart, I share that God will give them strength and that I and others are there for them. Just being present, sharing a kind word, and praying with them in turn renews my strength. As Saint Francis of Assisi wrote, “For it is in giving that we receive.”
When we only see life’s problems, we never realize the infinite possibilities latent in each day and hour. There is a divine design to every second of the day. There is a higher power. No diversion is without merit and meaning. If you meet someone, there is a holy purpose in the encounter. If you experience a closed door and a lost opportunity, know that you’re being pushed to find another opening in your life that you never thought possible.
The concept is radical but it will change your life forever. No moment is for naught; no encounter is random. When you find yourself seemingly off your projected path, rather than mourn, find meaning. In memory of Mary Tyler Moore, turn on the world with your smile.  This is her legacy and can be yours as well.

698,RELIGION,Why A Round-The-Clock Sit-In At This Catholic Church Is Ending After 12 Years,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scituate-friends-of-st-frances-xavier-cabrini_us_573b3fc0e4b0ef86171c1787,The Friends of St. Frances Xavier Cabrini have been working in shifts since 2004 to keep the building constantly occupied.,2016-05-17,RELIGION,"The occupation of a Massachusetts Roman Catholic church to prevent its closure will end now that the Supreme Court has declined to hear the case brought by people who have held their ground for 12 years, the Friends of St. Frances Xavier Cabrini said on Monday.
""We made this deal with the lower courts that we would vacate the premises within 14 days of the Supreme Court decision,"" said Jon Rogers, a leader of the Friends' group. ""From the very beginning we have promised to exhaust every avenue of appeal available to us and we have now done that.""
The occupation dates back to the early days of the U.S. clergy sex abuse scandal when the Archdiocese of Boston decided to close and sell some 70 churches to cover its legal costs.
Rogers said the parishioners would hold a farewell celebration at the church in Scituate, about 25 miles (40 km) southeast of Boston, on Sunday, May 29, and end their occupation.
Working in shifts since 2004, the group of about 100 people have maintained a constant presence in St. Frances Xavier Cabrini Church, which was built in the 1960s. 
Initially, it was one of more than a dozen Boston-area Catholic churches occupied by parishioners, but the other groups either lost in the courts or abandoned their efforts.
They have held regular prayer services, but without the involvement of a priest the church did not offer Masses.
The parishioners contended that since their donations had paid for the church to be built, they were entitled to a say in its closing. The church is on 30 acres (12 hectares) of waterfront land.
Lower courts repeatedly rejected their reasoning and last year a state court ruled that the group was trespassing.
Terrence Donilon, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said in an e-mail that the church was pleased with the court's decision.
Rogers said that after leaving the church, his group would gather in a new location and attempt to reach out to former Catholics who have drifted away from the church since the clergy sex abuse scandal surfaced in 2002.
""Although it is bittersweet that our spiritual home will be destroyed, we are excited about filling the void that has been left,"" Rogers said in a telephone interview.

That's how Gomyo, an American Buddhist priest living in Japan, envisions the future of his faith. Born Kevin Seperic, Gomyo began rapping in the 1990s and got introduced to Buddhism when he moved to Japan in 1994. Now he's spearheading a movement called ""Hoodie Monks"" to use hip hop as a vehicle for Buddhism practice and education.
“By expressing Buddhism through hip-hop culture, we hope to do two things: introduce people to Buddhist thought who might not otherwise be exposed to it, and offer an alternative to mainstream hip-hop, which is often preoccupied with materialism,” Gomyo told The Japan Times.
Gomyo became an ordained priest in the Shingon tradition in 2004, and he currently works at Yugasan Rendaiji temple in Okayama, Japan, which serves as the home for his group of ""Hoodie Monks."" His first hip hop album came out in 2014.
Japan has witnessed a decline in Buddhist practice, particularly among young people, in recent years. Though roughly 75% of Japan's population identified as Buddhist as of 2008, many only visit a temple at the time of a relative's death.
“In Japan, it’s not about exposing young people to Buddhism — it’s all around them — it’s more about showing them that Buddhism is more than something you do at funerals,"" Gomyo told The Japan Times. ""It’s a useful tool in dealing with daily life and it can be cool.”

Once inside the church’s hallowed walls, lie down, let your mind go, and watch as the ceiling is engulfed by swirling, electric lights.
The installation, called Voûtes Célestes or “Celestial Vaults,” is a work by artist Miguel Chevalier, who programmed 35 vibrant, colored networks that glow in dancing succession on the cathedral’s ceiling.
The color patterns are accompanied by musical improvisations played by Baptiste-Florian Marle-Ouvrard, the church’s resident organist.
On his website, Chevalier describes the installation as a network of “sinuous webs” produced in realtime to highlight the site’s architecture. He writes:
 Visitors are invited to stroll around, to sit in the pews, and to lift up their eyes toward the heavens. These digital constellations of pixels immerse visitors in an atmosphere bathed in light while opening unto infinity. The installation releases radiant energy into this space of plenitude. Amplified by Saint Eustache’s organ music, the installation induces a spiritual and contemplative feeling of elevation. Light, color and movement create a poetics of matter and elaborate a new aesthetics of virtuality.

Students would walk home and leave the evidence of their fun spread all over the outdoor public spaces. This always bothered me. There were many times that I rounded up my grandchildren and headed to the park with plastic bags in hand. I was committed to teaching them that it was expected that we’d give up a little of our own time and convenience to prioritize God’s creation as it deserves our respect and care. 
In Genesis, we learn about creation and its many parts. We learn that God loved what he crafted when he called it good. We know it pleased him to look upon it with pride. However, I’m aware that the over admiration of the earth and all its wonder could also be dangerous. He also created boundaries and distinctions. The Earth is not the sky and the land is not the water; there is a separation. When we worship the animals or make them equal to humans, we’re not maintaining the creation boundaries. 
Like many things in our world, it’s easy to exist in the extremes. Either we’re disrespecting our planet and refusing to care for it the way we’re called or we’re worshiping it as we should worship the Creator. 
Humans need to live in the balance of respect for nature and God’s divine boundaries. 
God has given us the unique charge of caring for his creation. We need to take ownership of that role. We’re expected to be good stewards of the gifts the creation offers us. Our reckless behavior, which causes irreparable damage in favor of time and profit, isn’t honoring to God. I hope we can remember that this Earth day and every time we’re tempted to make convenient, but damaging choices.

South Korea has some amazing Buddhist nuns ready to win your heart -- and they can rap like no one's business.
More than 300 nuns and monks convened in a Seoul temple on Thursday to participate in a prayer competition hosted by the Jogye Order, Korea's largest Buddhist organization. While most recited traditional prayers, several brave nuns took to the stage with rap and hip hop performances. 
A group of three nuns performed a variation on the classic Heart Sutra, beating on traditional drums and rapping their own lyrics: ""Great wisdom, perfect wisdom. Buddha's teachings that show you the way!""
One nun, Hye-Kang, told AFP that the alternative performance was aimed at attracting a more youthful following to Buddhism. ""I wanted more young people to take an interest in Buddhism and the message of its prayers,"" she said.
A senior member of the Jogye Order and one of the judges of Thursday's event, Venerable Yin-Mook, agreed with Hye-Kang's sentiments. ""We wanted to let people, especially young people and children, know Yumbul (Buddhist prayers) can be more interesting and easier to practice than they think,"" he told AFP.
A prize of three million won, or roughly $2,900, was at stake for Thursday's competition.
The rapping nuns of the Jogye Order may have taken inspiration from an Italian nun rap group dubbed 'Sister Act' in the late 1990s. These Catholic nuns similarly used rap music to bridge the misconceptions often projected upon them by people biased against nuns. Group leader Sister Alessandra told The Guardian in 1999:
""It is true that we are nuns but [rapping] is a more modern and different way of bringing the word of the Lord to young people. It isn't often easy.""

Communities, churches and individuals need to become and involved in working towards climate justice. The time to act is now. Tomorrow is already too late.",2014-09-19,RELIGION,"I am in New York this week to help in the preparations of the World Council of Church's (WCC) Interfaith Summit of Climate Change. Having breakfast in a hotel before a meeting is always a rush. This morning, some of the European WCC staff members kept asking me if the Styrofoam plates, plastic utensils and paper cups are ""normal"" in the U.S. hotels. I told them that it was ""normal"" and their response was, ""That is a lot of garbage"".
Our disposable lives have become too ""normal"" in our day-to-day living that we do not think twice about the environment as we eat breakfast, drink from plastic bottles and throw away our unwanted goods. We are becoming complacent in our ways of living that is slowly destroying the environment and causing climate change.
This week in New York City, there are a lot of climate change activities as churches, religious groups and governments are recognizing the devastating affects of climate change for people around the globe. A heightened awareness of how climate change affects the lives of everyone is growing. We need to be able to move toward climate justice for all. The most vulnerable are suffering far more greatly due to the damages caused by climate change. Climate change is becoming a matter of social and economic injustice.
Religious leaders are recognizing that they cannot remain silent on this pertinent issue as it is damaging the earth and causing too many problems globally. The World Council of Churches is taking this matter seriously and will be holding an Interfaith Summit on Climate Change to address this matter.
This Interfaith Summit on Climate Change will take place September 21-22, 2014 in New York City. It will gather 30 faith leaders such as Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Buddhist, Muslims, Sikh and Indigenous religious leaders to discuss how people of faith need to take this issue of climate change seriously and at the forefront of their agenda. Part of the statement from 30 faith leaders of the Interfaith Summit on Climate Change  reads:
""... share the conviction that the threats of climate change cannot be curbed effectively by a single State alone but only by the enhanced co-operation of the community of States, based on principles of mutual trust, fairness and equity, precaution, intergenerational justice and common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities. We urge the rich to support the poor and the vulnerable significantly and everywhere, especially in Least Developed Countries, Small Island States and Sub-Saharan Africa. Significant support would include generous financial resources, capacity building, technology transfer and other forms of co-operation.""
In conjunction with the WCC events is the ""Religions for the Earth"" conference held by Union Theological Seminary where more than 200 religious leaders from around the world will gather to discuss climate change: 
""This is no ordinary conference: as the world's political leaders prepare to address an unprecedented moral crisis, Union will offer a unique platform for the world's ethical leaders to voice the concerns and commitments of the spiritual and faith traditions. Participants are prepared to use their reach and influence to galvanize faith-based action. This action will be in support of a just climate treaty and the new measures within nations, regions and cultures that will be necessary to support the treaty and protect the most vulnerable among us in this time when profits are prioritized over the wellbeing of people, and the effects of pollution are being felt in extreme weather patterns, exacerbated social instability and a decrease in the quality of food, air and water.""
The Vartland newspaper in Norway quoted Rev. Dr. Olav Fykse Tveit who is the WCC General Secretary. Dr. Fykse Tveit believes:
""If one should create the large changes in both attitudes and actions required in order to meet climate change there needs to be deep and strong convictions. Knowledge and political action alternative is required, but you also need a sustainable motivation for a change. The belief, rituals, symbols, sacred texts and prayers of faith give meaning and direction for a large portion of the world's population. In these resources, we get a great reverence for the author of Creation. It is therefore important to see how this deep dimension of the human experience can strengthen the conviction that now is the time for change come. The WCC was asked to arrange an inter-religious summit to mobilize believers of all religions to stand together with us in the fight for a common future for all people and for the world.""
Dr. Agnes Abuom from the Anglican Church of Kenya who is the Moderator of the WCC Central Committee and one of the signatories of the WCC statement claims: ""We encourage the heads of state meeting at the UN to join with all people to take decisive steps to reverse climate change. Let us move together to rebuild, restore and reclaim a life-giving and life-empowering world where all live in dignity, peace and justice.""
The WCC events are happening just before the United Nations Climate Summit 2014. Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu ""called on delegates attending the upcoming United Nations climate summit in New York to take the first tangible steps to move humanity beyond the fossil fuel era."" He states, ""We are on the cusp of a global transition to a new safe energy economy, a transition that unites people in common purpose, advances collective wellbeing and ensures the survival of our species.""
We must prioritize the issue of climate change. We cannot ""normalize"" our disposable lifestyle that is hurting the environment. This is not only an environmental issue, but also an economic and social issue. Communities, churches and individuals need to become and involved in working towards climate justice. The time to act is now. Tomorrow is already too late.

Earlier this week, The Associated Press reported that the Obama administration had publicly criticized Israel’s plan to build a controversial new housing project in east Jerusalem. ""This development will only draw condemnation from the international community,"" an Obama spokesman said. ""It also would call into question Israel's ultimate commitment to a peaceful negotiated settlement with the Palestinians.""
On Thursday's episode of Robertson's show, “The 700 Club,” he claimed Obama's criticism stems from an inclination to side with Muslims.
“Like it or not, Obama’s pro-Muslim, he just is pro-Muslim because that has been his orientation in his early life,” Robertson said, adding that Obama attended a “Muslim school” while living in Indonesia as a child. 
As Right Wing Watch notes, the claim that the president attended a madrassa as a boy was debunked long ago. According to a 2007 Chicago Tribune report, Obama actually attended a Roman Catholic school and then a secular public school in Indonesia. 
Despite evidence to the contrary, Robertson has insisted for years that Obama is a secret Muslim. 
Robertson has also accused Obama of being a ""socialist"" who wants to ""destroy"" the United States.

705,RELIGION,Soundscapes and Our Sense of Belonging,"Kim Haines-Eitzen, ContributorProfessor of Religious Studies and Near Eastern Studies at Cor...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/soundscapes-and-our-sense_b_6622312.html,"Sounds are also not a cultural universal: music for one person may be noise to another; the sound of thunder may frighten some and be soothing to others; the call of the adhan may be ""grating and annoying"" to some and ""beautiful"" to others.",2015-02-06,RELIGION,"On Jan. 16, Duke University's Chapel bell tower was scheduled to resound for the first time with the ""Adhan"" -- the Muslim call to prayer. The chant, which would have announced the beginning of the Friday prayer services, was to be made by students in the Duke Muslim Students Association and be ""moderately amplified,"" according to Duke Today. But in the end, the vitriolic responses to the event -- including threats of violence -- proved to be too much, even for an academic setting like Duke University: Duke administrators withdrew support for the adhan from the chapel bell tower and left Muslim students to issue it from the quad outside.   What a loss for us all. 
We missed an opportunity to hear our campus, town, and city soundscapes ring out with a rich and dynamic expression of the values of inclusivity and diversity that we consider so essential to the American experience. Worse still, we privileged fears of exclusion (or forced conversion) over a sense of belonging.   Much of the debate around whether or not the adhan should be allowed from the bell tower is anchored in broader national conversations about the role of religion in the public and private spheres of our country. These debates often revolve around visual symbols of religious practice. Is it acceptable for the Ten Commandments to be displayed on state Capitol grounds, for example? What about a Christmas tree or menorah in a public setting?  The debates become even more challenging when it comes to sound. Sounds, of course, do not honor a public and private divide -- depending on how loud they are, they can extend well beyond their point of origin: road work or the garbage pick-up can be heard inside our homes; the sirens of ambulances and fire trucks are designed to broadcast ""Emergency!"" far and wide; church bells can be heard from within our town halls and capitol buildings.  Sounds are also not a cultural universal: music for one person may be noise to another; the sound of thunder may frighten some and be soothing to others; the call of the adhan may be ""grating and annoying"" to some and ""beautiful"" to others. The same can be said for church bells or the shofar. Sounds affect us, our emotions, and our sense of identity.
Religious identity and, more broadly, our individual and communal sense of belonging is influenced in multiple ways by ambient sounds. These sonic cues have long histories that go well beyond contemporary debates about ""free speech,"" modern technologies of ""amplification,"" and recent ""noise ordinances."" Who we are is closely interwoven with our sense of where we are, our sense of place -- a place that can be claimed, marked, or signaled by sounds as well as other sensory markers, like the look, feel, and smell of a place.   We have often overlooked just how strong an impact the sounds of our environment (our place) have had on religious ideology, literature, practice, and experience. Rituals and liturgies are perhaps the most obvious example of the importance of sound for religious traditions. But we might also consider how the Bible speaks of God's voice as the sound of thunder or the sound of rushing waters; the Quran, where thunder praises God; the Hindu notion of creation happening with the sound of the sacred Om. For fourth and fifth-century Egyptian and Palestinian Christian monks, demons roared like lions and hissed serpents, angels and demons alike chanted the psalms, and the monk's best response to both was prayer uttered under the breath. Simultaneously, these very same monks created tools for calling fellow monks to prayers, especially the semantron, or wooden sounding-board, that the monks struck (and continue to do so in monasteries across the eastern Mediterranean) to call the community for prayers and vigils.
So when we strike the semantron, ring the church bells, or chant the adhan are we controlling public space by means of sound waves, encouraging conversion or asserting the ""rightness"" of our belief, making a political claim by way of religion, or providing a sense of belonging, place, and ritual for a particular religious group? The answer is far from simple. It requires attention to our values of inclusivity, the ways in which our sonic environments have intersected with religious ideals, and a long view of the use of sound as an ""acoustic territory"" that may at once incite hostility for outsiders and a sense of belonging for insiders. Are we -- at Duke and in towns and cities across this country -- willing to allow our soundscapes to ring with the religious diversity we claim to value?

706,RELIGION,Progressive Christians: It's Ok To Take Our Denominations Seriously,"Peter Henne, ContributorAssistant Professor at the University of Vermont",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/progressive-christians-its-ok-to-take-our-denominations_us_59fa15d6e4b09afdf01c3fd6,"At one Lutheran church I attended in DC, the pastor sat down with new members and said denominational differences don’t matter",2017-11-01,RELIGION,"At one Lutheran church I attended in DC, the pastor sat down with new members and said denominational differences don’t matter anymore. According to the pastor, there’s not much of a divide between mainline denominations. The pastor later argued that in order to be more welcoming to newcomers we need to use less of the traditional worship and embrace “contemporary music” (which is actually about 20 years out of date) and non-liturgical elements. This process ended with me leaving the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (in which I had been raised) and joining the Episcopal Church.
I thought of this as I read Emma Green’s latest excellent article for the Atlantic on Lutheran-Christian relations during the 500th anniversary of the Reformation. It provides a great perspective on how we relate to each other today, but included one quote from the Presiding Bishop of the ELCA that concerned me:
“In the 16th century, we were killing each other over these issues,” Eaton said. Five centuries later, the ELCA and other churches around the world are marking Luther’s big moment. But “we are not celebrating the 500th anniversary of the Reformation,” Eaton said. “We are observing it.”
This brought me back to the church I left. If an ELCA pastor argues — in both word and deed — there is nothing distinct about this denomination then why bother sticking with this church? If the contemporary ELCA leadership doesn’t think we should celebrate our founding because it caused divisions in the church — divisions that I had always been taught were necessary — then what’s the point of this denomination?
These attitudes can seriously harm mainline Protestant denominations. If no one seems excited about their tradition, then some prospective members may just leave or stop attending any church at all. Others will treat churches like commodities, shopping around until they find one with the best combination of music and worship times.
Another issue is one that Green raises in her piece. As theological differences fade in importance, Christians are “organizing themselves based on ideological convictions.” That is, politics comes before faith. This is arguably what has been occurring with evangelical Christianity for some time, as seen in some evangelical support for Donald Trump.
But it is also occurring with mainline Protestants. Many mainline churches emphasize political stances over religious beliefs. This is not inherently bad; our faith calls on us to make the world a better place and never ignore injustice. But there is always a risk of the faith aspect fading. At that point, it makes more sense to just sleep in Sunday and devote the rest of your time directly to political causes. When you sit through a sermon on the problems of a big defense budget — without any connection to Christianity — you wonder why you came to church in the first place.
I’m sure I’m coming off as a conservative. Conservative Christians love to complain about progressives putting social justice ahead of faith, and abandoning tradition. But I am a progressive Christian, and have tried to push back on concerning trends in American Christianity. I love when a sermon applies the Scripture reading to current political issues, or when the congregation organizes a protest in response to injustice. This is an indelible part of my faith. But it is part of my faith; my political convictions arise from the beliefs I’ve developed through my religious tradition, and lose their power without them.
So what can we do? Well, let’s celebrate and embrace our differences (how’s that for a progressive Christian tagline?). Catholics and Lutherans in America won’t come to blows over our beliefs. We can engage on theological differences from a position of mutual strength, as both sides care about their beliefs but respect the other’s. We may never agree on the Pope’s authority, but we can find common areas we can work on — based on our respective theologies — such as caring for the poor and fighting injustice.
One area in which this often occurs is international religious freedom. As I’ve worked in this area, I saw people of different faith backgrounds work together to advance religious freedom despite their theological differences. While everyone had different beliefs about how to apply their faith to society — or in the case of atheist and freethinker participants, their lack of religious beliefs — we all agreed that every religious tradition should have a right to worship as they see fit.
I think progressive Christians (Lutherans in my case) worry that if they talk too much about what makes them distinct, they’ll turn off potential members and upset adherents of other faiths. But as long as they respect the beliefs of others, and present their own without denigrating opposing views, this sort of engagement can lead to transparency and trust. In the long run, this may make it easier for the ELCA to work with Catholics and others to act on our faith.

707,RELIGION,How An Illinois Mom Converted To Islam And Found Peace And Joy During Her Very First Hajj,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hajj-muslim-convert_n_5959514.html,,2014-10-12,RELIGION,"Kristin Szremski is a 53-year-old mom from Palo Hills, Illinois. Born into a Missouri-Synod Lutheran family, she first converted to Catholicism before finding her place in Islam. This year, Szremski was one of the hundreds of thousands of Muslims who were drawn to Mecca between October 2 - 7 to complete the fifth pillar of Islam, the Hajj. 
She tells Huffington Post about her experience below. Some answers have been edited for length and clarity.
1. How did you come to Islam and what was it about the religion that moved you? 
I was a special assignment reporter for the Star Newspapers in suburban Chicago in 2000. I was assigned to cover the Arab community. At that time, I didn't know anything about Islam -- I was raised as a Missouri-Synod Lutheran and we had been taught that all religions and prophets that came after Jesus were false. 
During the six weeks I had for research, I interviewed many, many Arab Muslims. My conversion was not something that happened overnight; it probably took more than 18 months. I was fascinated to learn that Islam had all the same stories as the Bible as well as the same characters. 
To back up a bit -- I was raised Lutheran, but converted to Catholicism when I was about 40. I always wanted to belong to a large community and I was intrigued by the Catholic Church. Since my husband at the time was Catholic, I decided to join the church. That had a huge impact on my later conversion to Islam because where the Lutheran church believed in the Bible literally, the Catholic Church encouraged knowledge, questions and also gave us the historical context for the books contained in the Christian canon. This allowed me to open my mind to the possibility that the Quran was truly the revealed word of God. 
Once I came to believe this, it was an easy step to believe Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the messenger and prophet. The harder part was letting go of my belief that Jesus was the Son of God. Ultimately, it was the passages in the Quran where God tells us that He was not begotten nor has He begotten and similar ones that finally helped me. Also, Jesus figures prominently in Islam so I wasn’t letting go of him, but just the idea that he is God. 
In the end, my conversion came while I was praying. The date was July 21, 2001. I was in a hotel room in Washington DC, where I'd gone to cover a meeting for a magazine I was writing for. I had the Quran open on the bed before me and I was actually on my knees praying, asking God to lead me to the truth when suddenly I declared the Shahada –- that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is His messenger. I later made a public declaration in Arabic but for all purposes it was at that moment that I became a Muslim. 
I love Islam because of its purity, its simplicity and its truth. The Muslims I had met were truly pleasant, patient and well-mannered people. 
 2. We understand this is your first hajj. Were you nervous at all?  I was very nervous about this trip because it is a heavy spiritual journey, which means there's a lot of personal reflection. It is also a very physical experience, with many different components taking place over several days. I’ve had two surgeries on my neck and lower back because of the degenerative arthritis and it has left me with some slight neurological deficiencies. One of the biggest of these is weakness in my legs, which things like overuse, fatigue, lack of sleep, extreme conditions can exacerbate. 
3. Was there someone who showed you around? How did you know what to do?  I was traveling with a tour group, called Noor Travel, out of Milwaukee. The tour guide was extremely helpful. Plus, my lovely roommates are Arab American women who can help with the language as need be. There are also people in the group who have done this before who can offer advice. When all is said and done, though, 3 million people in one small place is pretty overwhelming and daunting so I pretty much learned as I went along. 
 4. Are there any parts of the hajj that you were particularly looking forward to?  Muslims pray in the direction of the Kaaba from wherever they are in the world. Being in the presence of God in Mecca, at the very center of the Earth, where Adam and Eve came to earth from the Garden of Eden, where Abraham and Ishmael rebuilt the Kaaba, and where Muhammad (peace be upon him) lived and received his first revelations from God is a tremendously invigorating and rejuvenating experience. To be able to see the Kaaba right in front of me after all these years was powerful and something I don’t believe I will ever forget. 
5. How did it go? I did much better physically than I expected. I’m actually feeling better now than before I left for the trip, mainly due to an improved state of mind that this trip brought about. In addition, Islam is always about moderation and the religion is not meant to be difficult. Therefore, certain accommodations are possible during the rites of Hajj.
There are three types of Tawafs, or circumambulations of the Kaaba. During each Tawaf, Muslims circle the Kaaba seven times.
I was able to use a wheelchair to circumambulate the Kaaba the first time. 
During the second Tawaf, called Tawaf Al-Ifadah. I wanted to walk by myself so I could really concentrate on ‘talking to God,’ in my supplications and in worship. I also wanted to make the physical effort for God, as so much of Islam is about taking action with the help of God. This was an extremely beautiful experience for me, extremely spiritual. I finished the entire rite in just under three hours. Then it took me about one hour to make the usual 10 minute trip back to the hotel because I had overdone it a bit.
I was not able to finish the third Tawaf, called Tawaf Al-Wada or the Farewell Tawaf, because I was unprepared for the millions of people who were there at the same time as me. I was getting hurt and not strong enough to withstand the crush of people. So, sadly, I had to leave without completing it. To expiate for missing that rite, I paid to have a sheep slaughtered and its meat given to the poor.
Throwing stones at pillars that symbolize the spots where Satan tempted Abraham, who was preparing to sacrifice his son, is another rite of Hajj. Because of the sheer physicality it takes to walk up a steep hill to the throwing area and the danger of being in a crowd of a few million people throwing what are supposed to be pebbles but sometimes turn out larger, women, the elderly and people with health conditions can ask someone to throw the stones for them. I took advantage of this and asked some other group member to throw for me.
An integral part of the Hajj is the visit to Mount Arafah, where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) prayed on the ninth of Dhul Hijjah when he made Hajj. The Day of Arafah is a day of atonement, when we stand in prayer from just after the sun reaches its zenith during midday until sunset. This year, it was about six hours. We were at Arafah long before that, though. We stayed in sweltering tents. It was 108 degrees outside and hotter inside because the air conditioning did not work.
If one stands in Arafah in sincere devotion and sincerely repents of his sins, all his sins will be forgiven. And we also believe that supplications on this day made sincerely will be answered. Standing is key, although allowances are made for older people or people, like me, with health conditions. I stood a great deal of the time but had to sit from time to time. 
It was probably the most difficult physically and spiritually of the entire trip. But it was also extremely beautiful and cleansing. The most beautiful time came when it was close to sunset and hundreds of people gathered on a hillside, facing the Kaaba in the West, to make supplications while the sun was setting. All this was done while one imam made the supplications, called du'as, out loud. It was extremely powerful and many people, including me, were crying. 
I think there's a recurring point here. Hajj requires extreme effort but then offers extreme beauty, peace and joy in return. 
 6. What were you searching for during this pilgrimage? Did you find it?  What I wanted most out of this journey is to find a deeper relationship with my Creator, to get to the place where I have the confidence of my conviction that God is all I need or will ever need. I was praying for this absolute, intuitive trust because who have attained this level of faith are never worried or discouraged. 
I believe I absolutely found what I was looking for, although I also realize that this is something I have to work on every day. In Mecca, in the presence of the Kaaba, I felt God’s presence in a way that I never have before at any time in my life. There was an overwhelming feeling of love that inspired trust and confidence. I could pour my heart out, ask for anything and worship God.
Now that I have experienced this pure connection to God, I want to maintain and grow it. The onus is on me to make the changes necessary to help this happen. For instance, I plan on attending congregational Fajr (dawn) prayers at the mosque everyday, God-willing.
7. What did you hope would change about you after hajj, on the inside? Did this happen?  The last 10 years have been difficult ones for me - I got divorced, moved, had two major surgeries related to the degenerative arthritis, lost my house in economic crisis, and am beginning to feel worn down by the rampant Islamophobia in this country. Islam is the perfect religion, but I am not living it perfectly. Instead of complaining, I should be thanking God for what I’ve experienced in the past few years. 
I think the biggest thing that happened to me was that I realized how spoiled I am as a privileged American, how ungrateful I’ve been for my conversion to Islam and for the life that I have.
People from all corners of the world come to Hajj and many of them do not have the means to stay in hotels, let alone tents. People leave their villages with not much more than a small sack of possessions, knowing they will be sleeping without shelter on a plaza, hillside, or on the street. Would I have that kind of devotion? I would hope so, but somehow I rather doubt it. It was these people, who inspired me to walk the second Tawaf, described above. 
A person’s Hajj can be invalidated for complaining, arguing, or gossiping so it is extremely important to avoid all this. Dealing with crowds of millions requires massive doses of patience, which can only happen when you start looking at individuals in the crowd as just that – individual human beings deserving of respect and gentle treatment. Exercising this kind of patience for two weeks brought about a deeper sense of humility, which I hope to remember as I go about my daily life. 
Finally, God says in the Quran that He guides whom He wills to Islam. As I mentioned, I’d been struggling lately because of things like Islamophobia. Instead of cherishing the fact that God called me to the religion, I’ve been focusing on superficial things that distract me from the real beauty of what it means to be Muslim. This experience showed me that I have been taking the great gift of this faith for granted.

708,RELIGION,Brazilian 'Surfer Angel' Considered For Sainthood,James Cave,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/surfer-angel-guido-shaffe_n_6773466.html,,2015-03-02,RELIGION,"
The world could one day get a patron saint of surfing now that the Vatican is considering a Brazilian man known as the “Surfer Angel” for sainthood.
Guido Schäffer, a doctor, took to the waves to connect to God; he helped others do the same. 
“Surfing for him was a totally heavenly experience,” Eduardo Martins, a close friend of Schäffer’s, told PRI’s The World. “In the water, he could feel God, he could talk to God, and in fact, I learned with him to pray before going surfing... Surfing a tube was the perfect experience, because it was like being embraced by God in the water.”
(Story continues below)
It was at Martin’s bachelor party in 2009 that Schäffer, who was 34, drowned while surfing off the coast of Barra da Tijuca, shortly before he was to be ordained as a minister.
Since then, people in the area have come to follow him, pray to him and bring him gifts. Some even claim that he has saved tenuous pregnancies or helped women to become pregnant. 
In November, the Holy See issued a ""nihil obstat,"" or no objection, document, beginning the process of canonization. In January, the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints gave permission to Rio priests to investigate evidence of Shäffer’s holiness.
John Lyons, who wrote an article about Schäffer for the Wall Street Journal, told HuffPost Live that many people in Rio believe it's an act of God that Schäffer was killed while surfing.
The canonization process can take decades. The first step is to be proclaimed a ""servant of God"" and beatified. Miracles performed by Schäffer still have to be investigated.
While the decision to allow Rio priests to submit evidence is an “enormous step” in becoming a saint, Lyons told HuffPost Live, it doesn’t guarantee sainthood.

Removal Of Ten Commandments Monument Is Nothing Like ISIS Rampages",Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/franklin-graham-ten-commandments-monument-isis_us_561c07b4e4b0e66ad4c8cbc1,So stop trying to compare them.,2015-10-12,RELIGION,"A 6-foot-tall granite monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments was removed from the Oklahoma Capitol grounds on Oct. 6 after judges ruled that its placement on government land violated state law.
Oklahoma's state constitution prohibits the use of state property to further any religious agenda, which makes sense given the United States' foundational principle of the separation of church and state.
But to Franklin Graham, president of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Samaritan's Purse charity, the monument's removal was nothing short of an assault on Christianity akin to the rampages of the Islamic State.
Graham claimed on his public Facebook page that ""[a]theists, activists, and anti-God groups like the ACLU, the Freedom From Religion Foundation, and the Military Freedom of Religion Foundation"" are out to destroy the Christian faith.
Graham failed to note that the Islamic State has indiscriminately killed and terrorized Muslims, Yazidis, Christians and other religious minorities in the region.
Last year, militants told all ""People of the Book"" -- including Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians -- in Iraq and Syria they could either convert or pay a special tax if they wished to remain in their homes, according to The New York Times. If they refused, they could be killed, raped or enslaved.
The Islamic State has targeted sites that are sacred to many faiths in the Middle East, not even sparing those of importance to Islamic cultural heritage. In July 2014, a Twitter user claiming to be a member of the Islamic State threatened to destroy the Kaaba, a building at the center of Mecca's mosque and one of the most sacred sites in Islam.
In comparing the removal of Oklahoma's Ten Commandments monument to the attacks of the Islamic State, Graham joins a chorus of conservative Christians, including GOP presidential hopeful and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and TV host Bill O'Reilly and others, who claim that American Christians like Kim Davis -- the Kentucky county clerk who was jailed briefly for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses -- are being persecuted for their beliefs. But the atrocities being committed against Christians, and all faiths, by the Islamic State are horrifying and draw no comparison in the U.S.
Ironically, the supposed champions of religious liberty were silent when Muslim Americans were forced to walk by hateful protesters on their way to mosques around the country this weekend.

I do not take my freedoms for granted. I have never missed an opportunity to exercise my right to vote. And thus far, I have sat silently on the sidelines of this election, eating popcorn and shaking my head at the absolute absurdity of it all, praying that some sanity would emerge before November. But if I still have Christian brothers and sisters who plan to vote for Donald Trump, continuing to be silent would be inexcusable. At the very least, we must expect and require that the leader of our country be decent, respectful, and intelligent.
I won’t reiterate the most recent Trump quotes here, as that has been done, but I will reiterate the character of my Jesus.
The Jesus I know was a feminist; he honored women and showed them respect in the midst of a culture that treated them like property. He shared his life with women, walked alongside them, served them, cried with them, and treated them as equals. When marriages were arranged and women had no power, he called out men to love their wives, to serve them, and give their very lives up for them. He revealed some of his greatest miracles to women first, and men second. He protected them and loved them as a brother and friend.
The Jesus I know sought out the hurting and marginalized. Those who society mocked and feared and rejected, he saw and touched and healed. He surrounded himself with the sick, the disabled, and the poor. He treated them like dignified human beings, even when everyone else cast them out. Jesus was an activist.
The Jesus I know was humble. He was a servant. He lived without money or property or public esteem. The only people he rejected were those inflated with their pride and selfish with their wealth. He had no tolerance for those who only cared about money and self-serving ambition.
And, perhaps most astonishingly of all, Jesus loved the unlovable. I believe with all my heart that Jesus loves Donald Trump, but that he grieves over his despicable words and actions.
That is my Jesus. And if you follow him, I pray that tomorrow, you would follow him straight to the polls.

I didn't expect to be on a flight to Mexico. I thought I would spend most of today completing multiple unfinished writing projects that I have long neglected. Things changed when I met Ramon. Carrollton, Texas is not the type of place one would expect miracles to happen. When I pulled up to the apartment complex two days ago, I had no idea what I was getting into. 
I only had vague knowledge that a young man was dying of bone cancer inside and needed help. Upon seeing Ramon, I knew the situation was dire. Ramon's father seemed to be giving all the help that he could conjure up. The remainder of Ramon's family was back in Guadalajara. Then came the request...""Can you help us get him back to Mexico?""  Through much conversation and consultation, persons from the Cathedral of Hope United Church of Christ, our Spanish-speaking congregation and Hope for Peace and Justice worked together to devise a plan to get Ramon home. I was overwhelmed and heartbroken by the whole situation. Truthfully, I was afraid and ready to get out of the apartment. 
When a traveling companion fell through for Ramon, one of my colleagues looked up and declared, ""Can anyone travel with him?"" Though words came out of my mouth, I know that I didn't speak them. It was as if I was listening to someone else. ""I will go!"" I heard. When I realized that it was my mouth the words came out of, I knew the Spirit had spoken. In the countenance of the universe, I realized a miraculous human union beyond the power of death and across boundaries of language and nationality was taking place.  For the last few days, I have grown angry thinking about the factors that complicate Ramon's situation. Though he has spent ten years working hard and paying taxes in this country, he does not have the proper papers to be documented. Without papers, Ramon has had an incredibly difficult time securing healthcare that could save his life. Due to his Mexican nationality, many in our country have treated him as something other than human. 
Ramon has relied on the charity of strangers to get through this difficult hour. Some have been charitable and some have not. From his nationality to his access to money, Ramon has lived his life on the other side of a boundary from most of us. Though he was here with us, we were not with him. We forgot that we belong to each other. We forgot that Ramon is in us and we are in Ramon. Today, I am experiencing human connection with Ramon in all fullness.  The cries of pain and sorrow that filled the air as Ramon's dad kissed his son for the last time at the airport shook my bones. In the deep love that I saw exchanged, I saw how much God loves us. I prayed for the day when death will be no more. When Ramon kissed his dad goodbye for the last time in this life, I knew that I was witnessing something eternal. Passing through security, Ramon was unable to lift his legs. I picked up each leg and helped him stand. I realized in this moment that Ramon was teaching me how to lift my legs and stand. Getting on the flight, I lifted Ramon out of his wheelchair and placed him into another wheelchair. In this moment of my frustration that he even had to switch chairs, Ramon taught me to be flexible. While I administered morphine to Ramon, I realized that he was medicating me with his presence. Throughout his groans and struggles of pain, I too groaned and struggled with the pain of knowing that a 28-year-old man was dying in front of me. What type of God would allow such a thing? When Ramon crossed himself and kissed his rosary, I embraced his faith as my faith. Throughout our deeply spiritual journey, I realize again and again that the images of God we all carry connected Ramon and I. In my moments of doubt and anger, I realized that God was with us because Ramon was with us.  Upon arrival to Guadalajara, we walked tall together. Together, we made it. There was a woman who walked up to Ramon and said she saw him on television. After giving him some money, she asked that Ramon interceded to the Virgin of Guadalupe on her behalf. From my vantage point there was no need for intercession, the heavenly saint was being made reality right before our eyes. When Ramon encountered his brothers and friends, I struggled to maintain my composure. In the midst of a monumental sadness at an approaching death, the joy that flowed out transcended death. Though Ramon's trip had just ended, I knew it had only just begun.   Though I have only known him for three days and will probably never speak to him again, Ramon will remain with me for eternity. I don't speak such a thing to be dramatic. I speak it because it is true. Love is eternal. Though we couldn't easily speak to each other, Ramon and I shared love in our brief moments of union. In allowing borders to subside and love to come in, we quickly realized that we belong to each other. In the midst of such numerous borders to human flourishing, I pray that the world will realize the same.  Amen.

714,RELIGION,A Holocaust Survivor Band Plays The Music Of Their Youth,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/holocaust-survivor-band_n_6687354.html,,2015-02-15,RELIGION,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — They're almost 90, survived the Holocaust and love to play music together, so why not?
Saul Dreier and Reuben Sosnowicz, nostalgic for the tunes of their youth, have started a group with an unlikely name that tells just a part of their story: the Holocaust Survivor Band.
Completing its first year, the band has proven popular along the local synagogue/flea market/retirement-home circuit, attracting hundreds of South Floridians who relish klezmer and Big Band music. Dreier, 89, said the band is booked at local venues through April.
With Dreier, of Coconut Creek, on the drums, and Sosnowicz, 85, of Delray Beach, on keyboard, the musicians exude joy at the chords they learned as kids and longing for the families they lost during World War II. Other players also have Holocaust connections, such as Chanarose Sosnowicz, 53, the vocalist and Rueben's daughter, and Jeff Black, 64, the British-born rhythm guitar player from Hollywood. He was the child of Holocaust refugees whose families perished in the Auschwitz concentration camp.
Dreier said he got the idea for the band when Alice Herz-Sommer died last year at 110, the oldest-known Holocaust survivor at the time. Herz-Sommer survived Theresienstadt concentration camp by playing the piano on orders of the Nazis to fool the Red Cross.
Inspired by her dedication to music, Dreier shared his plan with his wife and rabbi; both said Dreier was nuts, but he was undeterred.
""I decided to go for it,"" said Dreier, a retired owner of construction companies and grandfather of six. ""I asked everyone, 'How can I find musicians who are survivors? ""'
A friend told him about Sosnowicz, who had been playing keyboard at Café Europa gatherings of Holocaust survivors sponsored by local Jewish Family Service agencies. Sosnowicz was a hairdresser, photographer and professional musician who played in New York City Jewish theaters and the Catskills during its heyday in the mid-20th century.
Both men are from Poland. Sosnowicz was born in Warsaw and spent much of the war hiding in a Polish farm. Dreier lived in Krakow and survived several concentration camps, including Plaszow, Auschwitz and Mauthausen. His entire family was killed by the Nazis.
After the war, Dreier was sent to a displaced persons camp in Italy, where he learned to play the drums. He said he never played again until he discovered a drum set at his synagogue, Temple Haim in Margate, about a year ago. He spontaneously began to replay the music he recalled from his 20s.
The Holocaust Survivor Band plays an assortment of tunes, including klezmer, the joyous Jewish folk music. Many Jews and non-Jews recognize the spirited dance song, ""Hava Nagila,"" from bar mitzvahs and weddings, but in recent years, klezmer has proven its flexibility by combining with rap, bluegrass and swing, said Aaron Kula, director of music performance and education at Florida Atlantic University's Libraries.
""It's ever-changing and evolving,"" Kula said. ""Every generation has changed it to fit their taste.""
The Holocaust Survivor Band has achieved success at an optimal time for both Dreier and Sosnowicz. As he approaches 90, Dreier said his energy to pursue this project continues to surge, despite a bout with stomach cancer.
And Sosnowicz had become depressed after his wife had a stroke, his daughter said. She said playing in the band has restored his good humor.
""I haven't seen him happy like this in years,"" she said. ""He has been able to reinvent himself and find a bigger purpose than taking care of his wife.""

715,RELIGION,How the LGBT Experience Will Transform the Practice of Mindfulness,"Jay Michaelson, ContributorColumnist@The Daily Beast, Meditation avatar",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-the-lgbt-experience-w_b_5499928.html,"Does being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender have anything to do with practicing mindfulness? Sure. Over the years, many LGBT voices have made themselves heard within Buddhist communities, and have enriched the sangha as a result.",2014-06-17,RELIGION,"Does being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender have anything to do with practicing mindfulness?
Sure. Over the years, many LGBT voices have made themselves heard within Buddhist communities, and have enriched the sangha as a result. 
But the interesting part is just beginning--and it has less to do with inclusion than with insight.

Understandably, most LGBT dharma teachers have tended to emphasize ways in which meditation can help promote healing from the traumas of homophobia, and ways in which dharma communities can themselves become more inclusive. For example, Larry Yang, who had led numerous retreats for LGBTQ people, has said that much of his work is ""shepherding ourselves through the collective traumatization that we have as LGBT folks."" Concurrently, some of the most inspiring engaged Buddhist work of the last several decades responded to the ravages of the AIDS plague; for example, Issan Dorsey, a gay Zen roshi, was one of the first religious leaders to reach out to San Francisco's gay community during those horrible years. And there are several LGBTQ sanghas across the country, such as Open Sky, Queer Dharma and Queer Sangha, as well as two Queer Dharma anthologies, and other essays and books. 
There have also been attempts to find ourselves, or legitimate ourselves, in Buddhist communities and traditions. The Dalai Lama has been asked for his opinions about homosexuality, and reproved for not offering progressive enough ones. (His initial statements, made many years ago, essentially regarded all same-sex intimacy as a form of improper sexual behavior. More recently, he has said that if LGBT people are in wholesome relationships, then sexual intimacy is likewise wholesome.) Buddhist scriptures have been scoured for references to homosexuality (for monks, it is a form of improper sexuality roughly equivalent to other violations of celibacy; for others, the texts vary), while the Japanese tradition of same-sex love among monks and samurais has received some scholarly attention, though like most such traditions, it is scarcely known among laypeople. 
But this is just the first stage. In fact, the interesting stuff is just getting started.
Consider, for example, the unique intersection between queer theory and the dharma. Queer theory, the academic discipline that grew out of gay lesbian studies in the 1970s and 1980s , has long held among its central tenets the notion that gender is socially constructed. How a man acts, how a woman acts; what clothes and tastes and professions we're supposed to have; even what anatomy men and women are supposed to have - all of these are socially constructed and inscribed in the mind, not the body. 
Confounding assumptions and conventions about gender helps animate and articulate drag performance, camp rejections of gender binarism (no, Virginia, the world is not divided into masculine and feminine), articulations of queer sexuality, and countless other aspects of LGBTQ existence. None of us is man or woman, except insofar as we participate in cultural discourses of masculinity or femininity. And like other cultural discourses, what is ""manly"" shifts over time and place: there are cultures, today, in which holding hands with other men, wearing skirts, wrestling naked, and even engaging in forms of same-sex activity are all seen as entirely ""manly.""
The constructed nature of that which we take as given is also an essential part of the dharma. With regard to gender specifically, Buddhist scholar and feminist Rita Gross has pointed out in the context of feminism, gender constructs and gender identity are aspects of the ego. Queer theory, too, by pointing out the non-essentialistic nature of these egoic conditions, can thus be of tremendous use to dharma practitioners - and even those who practice secular mindfulness - regardless of their sexual or gender identity. Questioning our supposedly innate characteristics--that women are supposedly one way and men another; that women and men are a stable, binary map of all gender identity; that to be a ""man"" involves certain essential traits--is a gesture toward a more robust self-understanding and a more enlightened one. It's all drag, really: the identities, genders, gender roles, gender expressions. Queer theory and the evolving dharma of the West meet at the juncture of non-self.
These aspects of queer theory can also call out a potential trap in the creation of LGBT dharma communities. Any ""identity"" can become a kind of self-definition, another fixed aspect of the self that one might consider letting go. Particularities of identity can be useful doors into the dharma - if they function as doors, not cul-de-sacs. 
To be sure, queer theory can seem rather abstract, and many of its academic proponents prefer it to remain that way. Yet it also captures much about how I experience my gender identity: as not fitting into boxes (including ""gay""), as being defined according to a variety of contingent cultural conditions, and as intersecting with other vectors of oppression far more interesting than the gender of my emotional and physical life-partner. This, I think, is true for many practitioners, regardless of sexual orientation. 
Even eros, which may seem so essential to our being, is part of the net of selfless causes and conditions, the empty phenomena rolling on, that constitutes our daily lived experience. When we speak, when we move, when we love - really what is acting are these endless causes and conditions, themselves the effects of previous ones. There is, as Sartre said, a great emptiness where we expect to find agency. Conditions are present, things move, anger arises, breezes blow--and there's no one minding the store, no essential identity even in those aspects of mind we consider most foundational. Yet as dedicated practitioners know, this insight ends not in nihilism but in liberation.
Let me bring it even further down to earth. I remember sitting in Penn Station in New York one morning while around me thousands of people were enacting and replicating memes installed by culture, religion, education, family. They were dressed in different ways, spoke in different ways, moved in different ways. I'm sure many of them took these styles and senses of self for granted. Many others, perhaps, did not. But what was happening? Cause and effect, non-self--this, as I have experienced it, is the liberation found precisely where some grieve the self's absence. I don't mean to dehumanize us with these metaphors and analogies; on the contrary, I mean to draw us into the same vast matrix of causes and conditions - including social conditions - and in some small way, forgive. That morning in Penn Station, tired and awaiting the train platform to be called, there was little ""given"" at all, and I noticed the arising of compassion and joy.

Steven Sieden, ContributorWorld renowned speaker and expert sharing Buckminster Fuller's...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hh-the-karmapa-teaches-on_b_7285792.html,"Nalandabodhi sponsored the final stop of HH the Karmapa's US tour last weekend, and the 1,200 people who attended his public teachings last Saturday had the rare and auspicious opportunity to spend some time with a revered young global spiritual leader.",2015-05-15,RELIGION,"Nalandabodhi sponsored the final stop of HH the Karmapa's US tour last weekend, and the 1,200 people who attended his public teachings last Saturday had the rare and auspicious opportunity to spend some time with a revered young global spiritual leader. In order to be one of those people, you had to be among the relatively more affluent elite as tickets were priced from a maximum of $500 to a minimum of $40. And nowhere did anyone see the often used Buddhist / New Age slogan ""no one will be turned away due to lack of funds,"" which assures that teachings are available to everyone.
We know that the Buddha never charged for his teachings, and I have no doubt that the HH the Karmapa and Nalandabodhi's Spiritual Leader Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche had nothing to do with what Nalandabodhi management decided to do with their leg of the Karmapa's two-month American tour. In many of his presentations, tickets were given away free of charge, but in Seattle the 1,500 seats were quite pricy with the ""cheap"" $40 seats selling out in the first day of sale.  I strongly believe that anyone who wants to get into such a spiritual teaching should be allowed to participate unless the event is sold out, and this event was far from sold out. I estimate that there were at least 300 - 500 empty seats at the Seattle Center Exhibition Hall, which is designed to be an exhibition area and not a place for large performances or lectures as happened with the Karmapa.
Not that all those seats had a good view of the stage. The flat rather than banked layout of the site as well as the enormous columns that blocked the view for many people left some participants wondering why they paid to be in the room rather than watching a livestream at home. Granted, Nalandabodhi management did provide several large screen monitors so that the majority of the audience could see because so many were too far away to see or simply sitting behind the columns.
Still, had the Nalandabodhi management been concerned enough to inform participants about the seating issues beforehand, people could have watched the same thing they saw on the big screens from the comfort of their homes at no charge (thanks to the Karmapa's office which live streamed the event and many of his other teachings at no charge, which is how dharma is supposed to be shared). Of course, if everyone had done that Nalandabodhi would not have made money.
Which reminds me of what my teacher and mentor Buckminster Fuller often told audiences about making money. Bucky said, ""You can make money or you can make sense because the two are mutually exclusive.""
Nalandabodhi management and its sister organization Nitartha Institute for Higher Buddhist Studies (where Nalandabodhi teachers recommend people for advanced studies) have always done their best to make as much money as possible, often pricing their events out of the range of ordinary working people, and this Karmapa tour stop was no exceptions. At least a couple hundred volunteers put in numerous hours preparing and producing the event and for their efforts Nalandabodhi management gave them - the chance to purchase tickets to the event at full price a day before the general public. That's right, they didn't even provide seats for their own volunteers, and the least expensive ticket was $40 plus fees and taxes. 
Then, there is the fact that there were no discounts for students or seniors or monastics. Buddhist Nuns and Monks had to pay full price just like anyone else.
When I attended HH the Dalai Lama's teachings in Vancouver last October, Nuns and Monks were provided with great seats at no charge and also given lunch between sessions. In fact, at that event and most others where HH the Dalai Lama teaches, many Buddhist Nuns and Monks sit on stage with the Dalai Lama, but there was no such honoring their service at the Nalandabodhi event.
In addition to the 1,200 people paying between $40 and $500 for a ticket (do the math to figure out how much they took in for this one event), Nalandabodhi also requested that members donate money to support this visit. Their plea read, 
You are here with us and we wish to give you the opportunity through this fundraiser to offer your personal gift of support for His Holiness' visit in Seattle. Your gift will help with all aspects of his visit such as nourishment, flowers and physical gifts of value to His Holiness, and the 8-10 people traveling with him, while he is in Seattle. Imagine watching the live webcast feed of the public talk and seeing the beautiful arrangement of flowers next to His Holiness Karmapa, and knowing that your donations helped place them there. Or, perhaps the dinner that His Holiness eats after the evening talk is supported by your donation. Maybe your gift will make a special welcoming or a special farewell possible to offer His Holiness Karmapa. Your donations will go toward making all of these wishes and more come true. All proceeds will go to Nalandabodhi in support of His Holiness the Karmapa's visit to Seattle.
We know that almost all the services listed here were ""staffed"" by volunteers. The cooking was done by volunteers, the transporting of people was done by volunteers, the flowers were done by volunteers, the laundry and cleaning were done by volunteers, etc., etc. So, where did all that money go? More important, did the Nalandabodhi management make money or make sense?
I'm not saying that HH the Karmapa or Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche had any intention to keep poor people from attending or use this occasion to make as much money as possible. In fact, I doubt that either of them had any knowledge of what the Nalandabodhi management has done.
One only need to compare the Nalandabodhi way to what will be happening in a couple weeks when Mata Amritanandamayi (a.k.a. Amma) begins her North American Tour here in the Seattle area. Amma's people take donations at all her public events, and that money is transparently used for the enormous amount of charity she provides to the poor. However, all Amma's events and teachings are provided free of charge to everyone.
Amma's people have to rent space, feed people, transport people, etc. just like Nalandabodhi, but they manage to do so without $500 tickets or pleas for financial contributions from members. They make sense, and people contribute generously to their work. 
Not so much with Nalandabodhi, which is known to produce very expensive Buddhist teaching programs and to constantly demand more and more from their members. Perhaps its time for the same sense of oneness and giving found in the Amma community to be manifest at the Nalandabodhi sangha. Then, the Buddha's teaching would truly be available to all people who come to Nalandabodhi and Nitartha Institute for Higher Buddhist Studies.
May all people be fully welcomed into all spiritual teachings and groups in order to support their full awakening.
Update: In the interest of full disclosure, I, Steven Sieden, submit the following:
I have been a meditator since 1975 and a practicing Buddhist since 2002. I was a member of the Nalandabodhi Sangha. Nalandabodhi's Spiritual Leader, Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche accepted me as a formal student / spiritual friend in 2008, and I remain student of and spiritual friend to Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche.
I have never been paid for any contributions to the Nalandabodhi Sangha, and over the years, I have contributed hundreds if not thousands of hours of volunteer time to the Nalandabodhi Sangha. Because of my 40 years experience as a professional event producer, in 2008 I was asked by the management of Nalandabodhi to submit a proposal for production of their scheduled 2009 Pema Chodron event. I created an extensive document (at no charge), and that proposal was summarily rejected (see comment below for details).
I was a volunteer on the team doing Ikebana flowers for the HH Karmapa event described in this post. As a volunteer I followed instructions and purchased a $40 ticket to the event a day before sales were open to the general public. That seat ended up being way in the rear and directly behind an enormous column with no view of the stage, but I was never informed that it was an obstructed view.
It was not until a few days before the event that I was told that 75 event seats might be available for volunteers. I did not take advantage of that possibility and entered with my $40 ticket. When the event was over, I worked with the Ikebana flower team to take down and remove the floral displays.

717,RELIGION,Microsoft’s Holiday Ad Celebrates The People Who Made 2016 A Better Year For Everyone,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/microsoft-holiday-ad_us_584728cee4b016eb81d89cf9,Thank goodness for these folks.,2016-12-07,RELIGION,"Microsoft’s 2016 holiday advertisement celebrates the accomplishments of ordinary people who worked hard to make 2016 a better year for everyone. 
The global tech company worked with the ad agency McCann to bring eight changemakers into the same room to create artwork that reflects their “vision of hope, peace and beauty.” The “Art of Harmony” ad featured people like Zianna Oliphant, a young girl who pleaded for justice at the Charlotte City Council after the police shooting of Keith Scott in North Carolina, Christopher Catrambone, an entrepreneur who founded the Migrant Offshore Aid Station to help rescue migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea, and Jazz Jennings, a transgender activist.
After letting the participants draw together (using Microsoft products, this is an ad after all), their artwork was projected onto Jane’s Carousel, in Dumbo, Brooklyn.
In a press release, Microsoft said, “This year has been challenging for many and much of what we hear in the news can be negative. Microsoft wanted to lift people up and remind them that ordinary people can make a difference. The message focuses on the spirit of the holidays, people coming together and celebrating what is good and right with the world—what unites us, instead of what divides us.”
The ad will run throughout the holiday season on television and online, in markets throughout the world.
Mona Haydar, a Muslim activist featured in the ad, told The Huffington Post that she hopes the campaign “functions like a healing balm or salve” to soothe hearts and minds this holiday season. Haydar and her husband Sebastian Robins are known for promoting interfaith engagement and understanding. After the San Bernardino attacks, the pair set up a booth outside of a Cambridge, Massachusetts library with doughnuts, coffee, and a sign that read “Ask a Muslim.” They invited passers-by to ask them questions about Islam, in an effort to combat stereotypes about Muslims.
Watch Microsoft’s short video on Haydar below. 
Haydar said that it was a pleasure to meet and make art with people she deeply respected and honored. As a Syrian American, she was especially moved by the work that Catrambone is doing to help refugees. 
“We had such a good time on set together as a group that I actually ended up having everyone over to my apartment for brunch to hang out more!” Haydar told The Huffington Post. 
“There is so much to celebrate and feel joyful about- and not a cheap joy either― a real and abiding joy that comes with hard honorable work that ensures that our world will be a more loving and beautiful place for us all!”

Jude Geiger, ContributorUnitarian Universalist minister",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ebola-isis-and-our-border_b_6008104.html,"When did we give up being the nation that welcomed the wretched, tired and poor upon our teeming shores? Now we imagine they are terrorists armed with viruses.",2014-10-21,RELIGION,"Ebola is a horrible illness. With more than 4,000 deaths from this outbreak in West Africa, I can only imagine the pain and suffering. But we have lost our perspective. The World Health Organization reports: ""Influenza occurs globally with an annual attack rate estimated at 5%-10% in adults and 20%-30% in children. Illnesses can result in hospitalization and death mainly among high-risk groups (the very young, elderly or chronically ill). Worldwide, these annual epidemics are estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths."" However horrible the virus is to those who have to face it, it's a blip compared to how the flu affects the world every year -- and many of us don't even get vaccinated for a virus that is actually airborne!
So why are we fixating on this right now? Fox and CNN seem to be covering it perpetually. CNN has even gone so far as to ask the burning question: ""Is Ebola the ISIS of biological agents?"" It's absurd, but it may be pointing toward what's actually going on. Ebola is terrifying. ISIS -- noted for public beheadings -- is terrifying. Both happen to be in the news right now -- and terror sells coverage. Information -- that which is most sacred to a functional secular society -- has been co-opted for profit -- and TV journalism has largely gone the route of fake reality TV mixed with video blogging to large audiences.
This isn't politics. It's cultural. We are experiencing a profound shift in American identity right now. News that's not sensational isn't valuable and comes and goes faster than the wind. Stories that will grip us, even if they're not actually worthy, in the scheme of things, of perpetual analysis, will linger because they keep us watching. They either reinforce our own beliefs or they foment fear. That's propaganda. We are beginning to live in a state of propaganda. 
Ebola and ISIS seem to have nothing in common, yet they keep getting linked. We're hearing story after story of fears that Ebola will invade us through Mexico or that ISIS will invade us through Mexico. On Thursday of last week, Fox News falsely reported that four ISIS agents had slipped through the border. In fact, our department of Homeland Security clarified that four Kurdish terrorists, who are part of an anti-ISIS group, had slipped through back in September and were detained. Was it ISIS or the enemy of ISIS that got into our country? And did they slip through or were they detained? Can they be detained and at large at the same time? That's the level of terror-fomenting we're living with right now. 
So we're stoked on terror and we stay glued. But is that all that's going on? I think the fear around ISIS (a Middle Eastern horror) and Ebola (a West African horror) and our Mexican border (where human beings are trying to work, migrate and find better homes for their children) is not about ISIS and Ebola, it's about racism. We can't argue against immigration reform with integrity, because most of us are decendents of immigrants from the past 100 years, so we need to come up with another way to keep Americans from trusting our neighbors from the South.
Just a few months back we had an influx of children fleeing gang violence, trying to find a home in the U.S. and the same media outlets were espousing fake stories about how safe it really was for children there. We can know this is factually untrue if we just think about ourselves. If you're a parent, could you imagine risking your family's life, crossing through a killing desert with your family, just to drop your child off somewhere else? And not doing that for any other reason than it's just simply THAT bad back home? And factually speaking, we actually do know there's significant violence from gang and drug cartels in Central American countries despite what some politicians will openly lie about. In the U.S., we call all that gang violence, part of the War on Drugs, yet we'll pretend it's not happening when we have kids show up on our doorstep asking for help.
When did we give up being the nation that welcomed the wretched, tired and poor upon our teeming shores? Now we imagine they are terrorists armed with viruses. We have shut our borders and imagine that every entry (from countries with people of color) are imminent threats to our safety and health. That we're a religious (or Christian) nation that can also ignore the pain and suffering of foreign nations wracked with illness -- as if caring for the suffering weren't a religious value. Ignoring the strife and illness in other nations, when they're asking for help, doesn't develop allies. It only seeds chaos and nurtures future unrest, that we know from history, often leads to more violence. It's not a wise a path. It's not a compassionate path. And it's not a patriotic path to ignore people in need asking for help. We are more than that.

719,RELIGION,America's Schools Have Been Hit With Bigotry And Anti-Semitism Since Election Day,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/americas-schools-have-been-hit-with-bigotry-and-anti-semitism-since-election-day_us_582f5c86e4b099512f82b5e4,This is frightening.,2016-11-19,RELIGION,"Reports of anti-Semitic, racist and anti-immigrant incidents at schools around the country have spread rapidly in the days since Donald Trump became President-elect Trump. These incidents are hitting not only colleges and universities, but high schools, middle schools and even a handful of elementary schools.
The Huffington Post has recorded dozens of reported incidents of racist vandalism and bullying in U.S. schools since the election ― and they began almost immediately.
On Wednesday, Nov. 9, Muslim students at New York University found “Trump!” scrawled in graffiti outside their prayer room at NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering in Downtown Brooklyn.
“We awoke on November 9th to a chilling wakeup call,” the school’s Muslim Students Association page wrote on Facebook. “And as we open our eyes and start to move and organize in the face of these new realities, we ask for your support.”
The school was hit again roughly a week later. On Thursday, residents of NYU’s Gramercy Green dorm hall awoke to find sticky notes covering their door with images of swastikas and messages like, “White Pride,” and “Made America White Again.”
Gramercy resident hall director Will McGrath sent out an email to the residential community on Thursday expressing his distress. In the letter, which The Huffington Post attained, McGrath wrote:
“These acts are vile, offensive, and unacceptable, to say nothing of cowardly. We view these matters with the utmost seriousness, and will not tolerate such intimidating, bigoted behavior here in Gramercy or anywhere else at New York University.”
Reported incidents of swastika graffiti have affected all levels of educational institutions. Middle schools in Florida and Maryland reported swastika graffiti found in boys’ bathrooms. A kindergartener at the Imagine School in Palm Coast, Florida came home with a swastika drawn on his hand and told his grandmother that an older student had forcibly drawn it on him during their after school bus ride.
“This incident is not consistent with our expectations of respect, tolerance, and civility toward all students,” the school’s principal James Menerd said in a statement to local news. “We take this seriously.”
At Paul D. Schreiber High School in Port Washington, New York, students encountered the anti-Semitic symbol in a boys bathroom Thursday morning. The Port Washington Union Free School District confirmed to local press on Friday that it is investigating the incident.
“This type of behavior is completely unacceptable, does not represent who we are as a school district or a community, and will not be tolerated,” district superintendent Kathleen A. Mooney said in a statement.
Racist incidents and anti-Semitic graffiti have been reported most at colleges and universities around the country, including in traditionally liberal enclaves like Portland, Oregon and Washington, DC.
At American University in Washington, a classroom whiteboard was reportedly marked with a swastika and the phrase “Go Trump” just days after the election. Students at Reed College in Portland also found swastika symbols and racist messages like “The white man is back in power” drawn on school bathrooms. 
The New School in New York City, the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, the University of Vermont, and the University of Mississippi are just a handful of other schools that have reported swastika symbols and other acts of vandalism since the election.
Schools have also been hit by overtly anti-Black and anti-immigrant vandalism and bullying in the days since the election. And beyond schools, there have been countless acts of hate reported at houses of worship, on public transit and in public places around the country.
The Southern Poverty Law Center recorded 437 reports of hateful intimidation and harassment between Wednesday, Nov. 9 and the morning of Nov. 14. Sadly, many more have been reported in the days since.
Reported acts of hate in U.S. schools are frightening but by no means representative of how most young Americans have engaged in this year’s election. Fifty-five percent of millennial voters cast their ballot for Hillary Clinton, with a sizable percentage opting for third-party candidates. Just 37 percent voted for Donald Trump, the candidate many felt peddled racism, anti-Semitism and bigotry throughout his campaign.
Students across the country have also participated in school walk outs, protesting Trump’s win and calling for an end to bigotry.
Samuel Kebede, a senior at Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland, told CNN on Tuesday that he blamed Trump’s campaign for stoking racism and opening wounds “that have not healed yet.”
“That is why I protest,” Kebede said, “to let him know that even though he has become our future president, the bigotry and hatred will not be tolerated.” 
Have you been a victim of an act of harassment or discrimination? If so, we encourage you to report the incident to local authorities, and to send us an email about it at: trackinghate@huffingtonpost.com.

720,SCIENCE,"Crescent Moon, Venus, Jupiter Visible In Pre-Dawn Sky Tomorrow",,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/crescent-moon-venus-jupiter_us_5baeafece4b014374e2db172,"Sometimes, such an occasion brings with it a sudden spike of phone calls to local planetariums, weather offices and even",2012-07-14,TECH & SCIENCE,"By: Joe Rao  Published: 07/14/2012 07:22 AM EDT on SPACE.com
 Venus, Jupiter and the moon will gather together in the early morning sky Sunday (July 15), and provided the weather conditions cooperate, the celestial show will be well worth getting out of bed.
 Should weather conditions be favorable, set your alarm clock for around 4:30 a.m. local time on Sunday, and then proceed to a location where you will have a clear and unobstructed view of the east-northeast sky.
 Rather than partake in the usual ""inside-the-eyelid show"" at that somewhat ungodly hour, you can instead be rewarded with a view of a beautiful celestial gathering, as the slender crescent moon, just 13-percent illuminated, appears in close proximity to the two brightest planets in our sky. 
 Early risers who are up an hour or two before sunrise, and who are unaware or have no advance notice, will almost certainly wonder, as they cast a casual glance toward the skinny moon that morning, what those two ""large silvery stars"" happen to be. 
 Sometimes, such an occasion brings with it a sudden spike of phone calls to local planetariums, weather offices and even police precincts. Not a few of these calls excitedly inquire about ""the UFOs"" that are hovering close to our natural satellite.
 If bad weather or clouds spoil your view, you can also watch the planetary sky show online via live telescope views from the Slooh Space Camera website.
 All together again
 This cosmic scene between the two brightest planets and a crescent moon will be somewhat reminiscent of a similar three-way gathering that took place in the evening sky on the last weekend of February. 
 The brightest of the dynamic planetary duo that will keep company with the moon Sunday morning will be dazzling Venus, which has adorned the east-northeast twilight sky since it emerged into view following its rare transit of the sun in early June. [Bright Planets in Summer Sky Explained (Infographic)]
 No other star or planet in the night sky can come close to matching Venus in brilliance. Right now Venus is shining at its peak brilliance for its anticipated morning meet-up, and is more than 17 times brighter than Sirius, the brightest star in the sky. 
 This summer, Venus is the unrivaled morning star, and will soar from excellent to magnificent prominence in the east-northeast sky at dawn. The planet will be visible 2.5 hours before the sun rises on July 15, with that period growing to 3.5 hours by August 15.
 In fact, if the air is very clear and the sky is a good, deep blue, try looking for Venus shortly after sunrise. Once you know where to look, you should be able to see it in the daytime long after the sun has come up, appearing as a tiny white ""speck"" against the blue sky. 
 Meanwhile, Jupiter, dazzling in its own right, though just 1/9th as bright as Venus, is also becoming increasingly prominent in the morning sky, rising about 3.5 minutes earlier and climbing progressively higher each morning.
 On July 15 at sunrise, Jupiter will stand 35-degrees above the horizon. As a benchmark, 10 degrees can be visualized as roughly the equivalent of your clenched fist held at arm's length. By August 31, Jupiter will be twice as high, soaring more than three-quarters of the way up from the horizon to the point directly overhead. [Video: Planet Jewels of the Summer Night Sky]
 An Earthlit ball
 Also on Sunday evening, you may be able to see the full globe of the moon, its darkened portion glowing with a bluish-gray hue interposed between the sunlit crescent and only a bit of darker sky.
 This vision is sometimes called ""the new moon in the old moon’s arms."" Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) was the first to recognize it as what we now call ""Earthshine."" The effect is caused by sunlight bouncing off the clouds and ocean waters of our planet that is reflected up toward the part of the moon not illuminated by sunlight.
 But that's not all.
 As a bonus, this arrangement of the moon together with Venus and Jupiter will be positioned below the famous Pleiades star cluster, and will also be set against a fine V-shaped cluster of stars known as the Hyades. 
 Note the bright orange star at the end of the lower arm of the V, which represents the angry, fiery eye of the constellation of Taurus, the Bull. This colorful star is Aldebaran, ""the Follower;"" for it rises soon after the Pleiades and seems to pursue them across the sky. 
This skymap shows the position of Venus and Jupiter, in relation to the bright star Aldebaran and the Hyades and Pleiades star clusters, in the eastern sky on July 15, 2012.
 Keeping it all in perspective
 Keep in mind that this head-turning display will be merely an illusion of perspective: on Sunday, the moon will be only about 249,000 miles (401,000 kilometers) from Earth, while Venus is 175 times farther away, at 43.6 million miles (149.67 million km).
 Meanwhile, Jupiter is almost 2,115 times farther away than the moon, at 526.7 million miles (847.4 million km). Meanwhile, the Hyades — the nearest example of an open star cluster relative to our solar system — is located about 150 light-years away.
 Aldebaran, which from our vantage point appears to be a part of the Hyades, really isn’t. The star just happens to be an innocent bystander, merely located by chance in the line of sight between us and the Hyades star cluster. Aldebaran is, in fact, 65 light-years away, which is less than half the distance of the Hyades cluster.

Since Kelly landed back on Earth on March 2 after nearly a year in space, he has offered an insider's look at his life on land in photos posted to Instagram. Not only are his daily activities vastly different to life on the International Space Station, but he told CBS News that he also has changed as a person.
""I think I'm a little more compassionate now,"" Kelly said. ""I think it does change you when you spend all this time removed and detached from Earth. And you follow what's going on on Earth, and mostly what the news reports is not good stuff... we should be doing better. We can do better.""

Fourteen tongue-in-cheek trips to Mars, Jupiter, Venus and a host of exoplanets are on offer in the Visions of the Future series that NASA commissioned at its Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
""Imagination is our window into the future,"" said NASA, which uploaded the posters to its website on Wednesday.
JPL visual strategist Dan Goods told CNN the images were meant to spark people's interest in the universe.
""Many of the things we are doing today were imagined by artists and science fiction writers decades ago,"" he said. ""These destinations are all actual places that we know about, and one day, perhaps humans can go to them in the future.""
Although deep space travel for humans may seem a long way off, Goods said it's ""really important to us that we worked with the technical community to make sure what we were showing could someday happen.""
NASA commissioned the Seattle design studio Invisible Creature to create three of the posters -- of ""Mars,"" ""Enceladus"" and ""The Grand Tour."" The space agency released five others as part of JPL's Exoplanet Travel Bureau series in 2015.

From the dangers of climate change to the economic impact of evolution denial, America's beloved ""Science Guy"" has spoken out on all sorts of science-related topics. 
But what does Nye think about time travel and human cloning? What would he do with an invisibility cloak? What does he think about the morality of sex with a robot? We've never known--until now. Keep reading for Nye's responses to seven not-so-silly ""hypotheticals"" posed by HuffPost Science...

2. If you could clone one person, who would that be? Why him/her? I think you mean recreate with all the experiences and intellect of someone, who has already come into existence. I can't think of anyone, really. I am troubled by the notion that since we've discovered cloning, we perhaps could or should try cloning someone. A person is a result of a life lived with other people at a certain time in history. It's not a reproducible product. 
Cloning a person is a bad idea, because the offspring would be one evolutionary step behind his or her contemporaries. The key feature of sexual reproduction is that we get an offspring that is inherently different from the parents. Germs and parasites, which (or who) reproduce at extraordinary speeds, can't quite deal with the new mixture of genes. My O my…
3. Imagine there's an open seat on the first mission to send humans to Mars. Would you sign up? It would depend on who's mounting the mission. A few of the proposals of late seem underfunded, to put it generously, and just unrealistic.

4. If time travel were possible, what day/era would you want to get to? Why? What would you do? Whom would you meet?  I'd go for 250 years from now, after steps have been taken to address climate change and the world's human population has stabilized. I think my English would be intelligible that many years hence. I'd like to meet the human woman with the best smile and the best sense of humor on Earth. I claim that to have a good sense of humor, one has to be smart. A man can dream.
5. If you could be any animal but a human, which animal would you be and why? A well cared for dog.
6. If scientists were to create a real-life ""invisibility cloak,"" how would you use it? I'd disrupt climate change denier meetings.
7. Would sex with a robot be cheating? In my view, we have sex robots already. Sex toys or ""marital aids"" are sold by the millions, to a large extent, as a substitute for cheating.

 The impact of comets crashing into Earth's surface may have provided the energy to create simple molecules that formed the precursors to life, a new study suggests.
 That conclusion, published in the June 20 issue of the Journal of Physical Chemistry A, was based on a computer model of such an impact's effect on a comet crystal initially made up of water, carbon dioxide and other simple molecules.
 ""Comets carry very simple molecules in them,"" said study co-author Nir Goldman, a physical chemist at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California. ""When a comet hits a planetary surface, for example, that impact can drive the synthesis of more complicated things that are prebiotic — they're life-building.""
 Comet collision
 The notion that life-building molecules were carried to Earth via comets or asteroids, a hypothesis known as panspermia, has been around for decades. But the idea that the comet impact itself could have created the molecules is newer.
 When the Earth was young, comet bombardments may have brought 22 trillion pounds (10 trillion kilograms) of carbon-based material to the planet every year, Goldman said. That would have provided a rich source for the building blocks of life to form. In a separate recent study, scientists zapped a mini-comet in the lab to prove that precursor molecules could form far from Earth. [7 Theories on the Origin of Life]
 To test their hypothesis, Goldman and his colleagues used a computer model to simulate a single comet crystal of hundreds of molecules. Comets are mostly ""dirty snowballs,"" Goldman said, so the simulated crystal started with mostly water molecules, but also included methanol, ammonia, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.
 The researchers then simulated the effects of the crystal hitting the Earth's surface at various angles, from crashing into it directly to making a glancing blow. They followed the chemical changes in the crystal for about 250 picoseconds, about the amount of time the system needed to reach a steady state, where the proportion and type of chemicals in the system is stable. The huge jolt from the impact provided the energy needed to make complicated chemicals.
 ""Certain conditions were a sweet spot for complexity,"" Goldman told LiveScience.
 For instance, at pressures of about 360,000 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level and temperatures of 4,600 degrees Fahrenheit (2,538 degrees Celsius), the molecules in the crystals formed complex species called aromatic rings. These types of circular, carbon-based molecules could have been precursors to the letters in DNA.
 At higher pressures, the molecules produced methane, formaldehyde and some long-chain carbon molecules.
 ""Every time there was an impact hard enough to get chemical reactivity, it produced interesting stuff,"" Goldman said.
 As a follow-up, Goldman and his colleagues want to test different initial chemical concentrations in the comet to see how that affects the formation process.
 No way to prove
 The findings are fascinating, said Ralf Kaiser, a physical chemist who studies astrochemistry at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
 ""It opens another pathway to explain how these biological, or precursor molecules can be formed,"" Kaiser, who was not involved in the study, told LiveScience.
 The team has shown that such precursor molecules ""absolutely could be formed this way, no question,"" Kaiser said.
 But it's not all or nothing: Some molecules could have been carried here by comets from outer space, while some formed on impact, and still others formed completely from home-grown materials. The tricky question is to determine what percentage of life's building blocks arose during each process, Kaiser said.

726,SCIENCE,"Scientists Scan 100,000 Galaxies But Find No Evidence Of Alien Life",Macrina Cooper-White,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/search-for-alien-life-100000-galaxies_n_7063232.html,,2015-04-15,TECH & SCIENCE,"Just how realistic is it to believe that humans will someday find evidence of extraterrestrial life?
NASA's chief scientist recently predicted that we'd find signs of life beyond Earth within a decade or so, but a new study by researchers at Penn State -- one of the most exhaustive of its type -- isn't very encouraging.  After surveying tens of thousands of galaxies surrounding our own Milky Way galaxy, the scientists turned up no sign of advanced alien civilizations.
""These galaxies are billions of years old, which should have been plenty of time for them to have been filled with alien civilizations, if they exist,"" Dr. Jason T. Wright, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the university's Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds and one of the researchers, said in a written statement. ""Either they don't exist, or they don't yet use enough energy for us to recognize them.""
Turning up the heat. For the research, Wright and his colleagues analyzed a vast catalog of observations made in 2010 by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) space telescope. The team looked at the heat emitted by the 100,000 ""most promising"" candidates of the all-sky catalog's nearly 100 million entries.
""The idea behind our research is that, if an entire galaxy had been colonized by an advanced spacefaring civilization, the energy produced by that civilization's technologies would be detectable in mid-infrared wavelengths -- exactly the radiation that the WISE satellite was designed to detect for other astronomical purposes,"" Wright said in the statement.
The hypothesis that advanced civilizations could be recognized by their waste heat was first put forth by renowned theoretical physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, according to Space.com.
Time to give it up? Despite his negative findings, Wright said his study, published April 15 in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, was ""just the beginning,"" and that further research may yet turn up evidence of alien technology.
And other experts involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) told The Huffington Post that they're far from discouraged.
Dr. Avi Loeb, a theoretical physicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., told HuffPost Science in an email that it's possible alien civilizations are hard to detect because they use much less energy than Dyson proposed.
""The limits reported in this study rule out the most extreme environmental impact possible for an extraterrestrial civilization that harvests a significant fraction of the starlight in its host galaxy,"" he said. ""For comparison, our civilization processes only a thousandth of a trillionth of the energy output of the sun. Less visible civilizations are much more likely to exist, both in terms of the technological feasibility of energy harvesting as well as in terms of their energy needs.""
Legendary astronomer Dr. Jill Tarter, the former director of the Center for SETI Research in Mountain View, Calif. and the astronomer on whom Jodie Foster's character in the 1997 film ""Contact"" was loosely based, agreed that efforts to find extraterrestrial life should continine.
""It's absolutely not time to stop,"" she told The Huffington Post in an email. ""It's time to improve the sensitivity and specificity of these searches to be able to discriminate between signals produced by Mother Nature and those produced by engineers.""

727,SCIENCE,How Mindfulness Is Revolutionizing Mental Health Care,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neuroscience-mindfulness_n_6531544.html,,2015-01-23,TECH & SCIENCE,"More than 350 million people globally suffer from depression, and 1 in 13 people around the world have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Overall, the World Health Organization estimates that roughly 450 million people suffer from some form of mental or neurological disorder -- and that roughly one in four people will be affected at some point in their lives. 
These numbers are staggering. With the rise of mental illness and the increasingly pressing need for effective treatments, there's never been a more important moment for mindfulness -- the ability to cultivate a focused, non-judgmental awareness on the present moment. Research has shown mindfulness and meditation-based programs to hold promise for treating a number of psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
As research has mounted in recent years, mindfulness has migrated from spiritual retreat centers to medical facilities. Now, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) -- the largest scientific organization in the world dedicated to research on the understanding and treatment of mental illness -- is getting serious about investigating mindfulness as a complementary treatment for a range of mental health conditions. 
On Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, University of Wisconsin neuroscientist Richard Davidson and NIMH director Tom Insel joined a conversation hosted by NPR science correspondent Joe Palca about how mindfulness affects the brain and might lead to improved clinical applications for the treatment of a range of mental health conditions.
So what exactly is mindfulness, and how can it improve psychological well-being? 
""Mindfulness is about being fully aware in the present moment,"" said Davidson. ""It's about bringing our attention back to the present moment and not getting carried away by our thoughts.""
Attention is highly trainable through various mindfulness practices like meditation, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), according to Davidson. ""We can actually educate our attention,"" he said. 
Mindfulness helps to train individuals in bringing back the attention time and time again when it has wandered. And it is precisely through helping individuals to not get carried away by their thoughts that mindfulness has been shown to be so effective for conditions like anxiety and depression. In fact, a landmark recent study  from researchers at Lund University showed a group mindfulness treatment to be as effective as traditional talk therapy for treating anxiety and depression. 
Evidence of the efficacy of these mindfulness-based treatments continues to grow. According to Insel, there are now nearly 500 scientific studies on mindfulness/meditation and the brain in the National Institute of Health's PubMed database. 
Mindfulness makes a whole lot of sense as a therapeutic intervention for these conditions. 
""When they're depressed, people are locked in the past. They're ruminating about something that happened that they can't let go of,"" said Insel. ""When they're anxious, they're ruminating about the future -- it's that anticipation of what they can't control."" 
In contrast, when we are mindful, we are focused on the here and now. Mindfulness trains individuals to turn their attention to what is happening in the present moment. 
On a neurological level, we're beginning to have a better understanding of the brain changes that underlie the improvements in psychological well-being and reduction of mental health symptoms that have been documented with mindfulness trainings.
Importantly, research has shown mindfulness to increase activity in brain areas associated with attention and emotion regulation. Mindfulness also facilitates neuroplasticity -- the creation of new connections and neural pathways in the brain.
""What we call meta-cognitive learning -- learning to watch your own mind and to be introspective in that sense -- does have an impact on brain pathways long-term,"" said Insel. 
This knowledge about the neurology of mindfulness could one day lead to improved clinical treatments. 
But it's important to note that the beneficial effects of mindfulness also extend to non-clinical populations. Anyone can stand to benefit from learning to cultivate a focused, non-judgmental awareness on the present moment -- particularly in our busy modern lifestyles that are often characterized by stress, sleep deprivation, multitasking and digital distractions. 
Mindfulness research pioneer and founder of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, Jon Kabat-Zinn, who was in the audience at Davos, stood up at the end of the conversation to share his thoughts on the mindful revolution in mental healthcare, which he noted has been well underway for several decades. As Kabat-Zinn explained, research and testimonials from patients and clinicians suggest that we can turn ""the medication down and the meditation up."" 
""We've seen this in the clinical domain for many years. People, in concert with their physicians... actually going off their medications for pain, for anxiety, for depression, as they begin to learn the self-regulatory elements of mindfulness,"" said Kabat-Zinn. ""They discover that the things that used to be symptomatically problematic for them are no longer arising at the same level.""

NASA says the probe will continue its mission into the Kuiper Belt, the vast region of primordial debris that encircles our solar system. 
It will be lonely out there for sure. But maybe not as lonely as you might imagine. As McClatchy D.C. reported, the New Horizons probe won't be the only spacecraft at our solar system's edge -- it will be joining four other unmanned spacecraft that are already speeding their way out of the solar system: Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2.
(Story continues below images.)
The venerable Pioneer 10 spacecraft was launched in 1972 to explore Jupiter. It sent its last signal to Earth in 2003.
The Pioneer 11 spacecraft was launched in 1973 to explore Saturn. It sent its last signal to Earth in 1995.
The Voyager 1 spacecraft, which launched in 1977, made the historic entry into interstellar space in 2012 and continues to send signals back to Earth.
The Voyager 2 spacecraft, which launched in 1977, also continues to transmit data back to Earth.
While in the Kuiper Belt, New Horizons will examine celestial objects found in the region until it runs out of fuel, the Guardian reported.
""We have a chance to go further and explore the deep reaches of the heliosphere, like Voyager did, and to do that with much more modern instruments,"" Dr. Alan Stern, the principal investigator of New Horizons, told USA Today, ""and hopefully return data that will really add to the storehouse of what we know about our environment in the solar system.""
New Horizons has enough power to keep operating until the mid-2030s, Stern said. By that point it will be roughly 9.3 billion miles from the sun--and will continue on its way even after it falls silent.

729,SCIENCE,New Ideas About the Evolution of Same-Sex Attraction,"Rob Brooks, Contributor
Evolutionary biologist and author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-ideas-about-the-evolution-of-same-sex-attraction_us_5baeb39fe4b014374e2dffa7,"The idea is that when the epi-marks on genes that affect sexual orientation get passed from father to daughter, then some traits end up more masculinized. Likewise, mother-son transmission of epi-marks can result in the feminization of some traits.",2012-12-15,TECH & SCIENCE,"When I give talks about the relevance of evolution to modern life, I can count on one regular question interrupting an orderly transition from lecture theater to bar. Sometimes it comes with a ""bet-you-didn't-think-of-that-one"" sneer. Far more often it is asked earnestly and with palpable empathy. The question? ""How do you explain homosexuality?""
The very real fact that a large proportion of people across the world are sexually attracted to members of the same biological sex provides a giant obstacle to a Darwinian view of life. And I am always happy to field this question, because it allows me to explore, with the audience, some of the layered complexity of evolution. But a simple, definitive answer remains, for now, beyond reach. That may start to change, however, with a paper published yesterday in The Quarterly Review of Biology.
Born This Way
Evolutionary biology can be a bit of a blunt instrument, especially when it seeks to explain big, categorical differences -- like sex differences. Focusing at a broad scale means a lot of nuance and individuality gets ignored or trampled, which is why so many authors -- quite unfairly -- write off all biology as determinism.
Fortunately, biological ideas about homosexuality tend to be more welcome than biological ideas about, say, gender. That may be because so many gay people strongly feel that they were ""born this way,"" and because ideas about homosexuality being a choice or a curable condition proliferate in all but the most enlightened places.
But being ""born this way"" isn't necessarily the same thing as the traits involved being genetically determined. Genetic claims require genetic evidence. In support of a genetic basis, sexual sexual orientation has a moderate to high heritability, heritability being the statistic that describes how much of the variation in a trait is due to genetic differences among individuals.
But despite the statistical vapor trail indicating a substantial genetic basis, the search for major genes involved in homosexuality has been far less fruitful. And then there remains the problem so beloved of seminar questioners: How could any such genes have persisted through millenia of selection if they lead to sexual orientations that do not produce offspring?
The idea that ""gay people don't have children"" is simplistic and, historically, wrong. Being gay does not necessarily mean not having a family, and throughout history many -- perhaps most -- homosexuals spent time in heterosexual unions, having children. And yet even if a small proportion did not, this could have exerted strong evolutionary selection against any genes involved.
But perhaps those genes provided some other kind of evolutionary advantage that outweighed the direct cost of having fewer kids. Here, theories lie thick upon the ground. First, there is the idea that homosexual relatives provide exceptional help to their heterosexual relatives who are raising families. Any genes that raise the chances of homosexuality, then, are passed on through relatives. And the extra help means more nieces and nephews carrying those genes.
The second group of ideas hinges on the idea is that genes that make reproductively successful females can increase the likelihood of homosexuality when they find themselves expressed in males. And the opposite can happen for genes that enhance male fitness. Some support for this idea exists, as well, including evidence that families in which females tend to be highly fertile also have a higher proportion of gay men than one might expect by chance.
And Brendan Zietsch has written here about his own work showing that psychologically feminine men and psychologically masculine women who are heterosexual also tend to be more sexually attractive. He argues that genes that raise the chances of an individual being same-sex attracted also massively raise the mating success of heterosexual bearers being reproductively successful.
Each of these ideas has some empirical support, but not such strong support that the case can be closed. It remains likely that there is no single explanation and that several biological influences together shape sexual orientation.
The New Idea
But yesterday's big story is an entirely new idea that hinges not on traditional genetics but instead on epigenetics. The fact that gene expression is modified by molecules that attach to particular genes but can later be removed is revolutionizing almost every biological field, including evolution.
Genetics defies metaphors, but I'll try to mangle one for folks who prefer J. K. Rowling over modern molecular genetics. If we think of a person's DNA as a recipe book -- say Advanced Potion Making by Libatius Borage -- then the epigenetic marks (or epi-marks) are the annotations and corrections made in pencil by the owner. Epi-marks have many functions, many of them tailoring the DNA instructions to suit the circumstances in which an individual finds himself or herself.
Most epi-marks get erased before the recipe is copied and handed down to an individual's offspring, but that isn't always the case. Sometimes there are good adaptive reasons that offspring inherit epi-marks from a parent. And sometimes, like Harry Potter inheriting the Half-Blood Prince's potions book, they receive annotated instructions that were not intended for them.
Bill Rice, Urban Friberg and Sergey Gavrilets recognized that epi-marks are an essential component of sex differentiation. Males and females share an entire genome, and so development is fraught with instructions intended for embryos of one sex but not the other. One class of epi-marks protects female fetuses from the masculinizing effects of fetal testosterone. Another protects male fetuses from being feminized when estrogen signals would otherwise trigger female development.
Different genes are involved in the development of genitals, reproductive organs, body shape, sexual orientation and every other trait where genes shape sexual differentiation. And so epi-marks to these different genes will have different influences on those traits.
Mostly, these kinds of epi-marks should not be passed from parent to offspring, but occasionally some are. And when the epi-marks on genes that affect sexual orientation get passed from father to daughter, then some traits that would normally develop in female-specific ways end up more masculinized. Likewise, mother-son transmission of epi-marks can result in the feminization of some traits that would normally develop in a more masculinized fashion.
I should stresss that the new paper is a mathematical model showing that this scenario can work. The authors marshal plenty of circumstantial evidence that it probably does work. But the idea needs to be directly tested.
Apart from the fact that this is one of those rare ideas that completely changes how we look at the evidence, I am most excited by the way this idea reframes how we look at sexual development. I suspect that this idea will, in time, also shake up the science of sex differences and our understanding of how gender arises.

730,SCIENCE,Duck-Billed Dinosaur Fossil Shows Animal Had Strange Rooster-Like Comb (VIDEO),"LiveScience, LiveScience",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/duck-billed-dinosaur-fossil-comb-rooster_us_5baebcbfe4b014374e2eb75a,"No such comb has ever been discovered before on a dinosaur. In modern birds, such combs are typically used for sexual display",2013-12-14,TECH & SCIENCE," What has a mouth like a duck's and a comb like a rooster's? A dinosaur that roamed North America 75 million years ago.
 A new fossil discovery reveals the duck-billed dinosaur Edmontosaurus regalis sported a fleshy comb on its head, similar to the ones on modern-day roosters. 
 A reconstruction of Edmontosaurus sporting a fleshy ""rooster"" comb.
No such comb has ever been discovered before on a dinosaur.
 ""We're never short of being surprised by what these animals looked like,"" said study researcher Phil Bell, a paleontologist at the University of New England in Australia. [Paleo-Art: Colorful Images Bring Dinosaurs to Life]
 Finding the fossil
 Duck-billed dinosaurs, or hadrosaurs, were large herbivores that filled the same ecological niche as deer or kangaroo today. In the past century, paleontologists have discovered several hadrosaur fossils with skin impressions pressed into the rock around the bones. These ""mummy"" specimens, so dubbed because they reveal more than just bone, show that hadrosaurs had pebbly skin not unlike that of today's crocodiles and birds.
 Edmontosaurus regalis, found fossilized in Alberta, Canada.
 But skin impressions rarely preserve well around the skull, Bell said.
 Bell's colleague, Federico Fanti, discovered the new E. regalis fossil in west central Alberta, about 45 miles (75 kilometers) from the town of Grande Prairie. They were surveying a well-known fossil site when Fanti noticed a string of vertebrae peeking out of a coffin-size boulder, Bell told LiveScience. The researchers had not found many bones still articulated in their original configurations, so they decided to collect the specimen.
 ""Because the block was too big to move on its own, we used a rock saw in an attempt to trim it down,"" Bell said. ""But no sooner did we start cutting into it than we found the first skin impression. We kind of had to bite the bullet and collect the whole block.""
 It was seven months before the team could get to the site with a truck and trailer, because the nearby Redwillow River was so high. But in 2011, the researchers drove a truck across the river, winched the boulder onto a trailer and brought it out of the field.
 While Bell was preparing the fossil, he discovered something even more amazing than skin impressions.
 ""Having a good idea of the outline of the animal, I put my chisel into the rock, not expecting to hit anything, and lo and behold, I realized I'd put my chisel straight through the middle of some skin impressions that shouldn't have been there,"" he said.
 Surprising skin 
 Bell had found a fleshy dome extending off of the duckbill's skull — something that had never been seen before. The dome included no bones and extended from the front of the eye sockets to the back of the head. It was almost 8 inches (20 centimeters) tall at its highest point and about 13 inches (33 cm) long.
 ""You can actually see the wrinkles in the skin that indicate that it had some flexibility to it,"" Bell said.
 Edmontosaurus skin impressions.
 In modern birds, such combs are typically used for sexual display. They're found in both sexes in birds, so the presence of the comb tells researchers nothing about their dinosaur specimen's sex. The bones they do have belong to the neck and head, and don't reveal sex either.
 ""What we need to find now are additional specimens that show this structure, and perhaps by comparing their sizes or relative development, we might get an idea of their sex,"" Bell said.
 It's not clear whether the comb is a feature only of E. regalis or if other duckbills might have had similar fleshy accessories. Skin associated with the head may not preserve well, meaning that other combs have vanished without a trace, Bell said. Or, they may have been overlooked. In the past, paleontologists considered skin impressions less interesting than bones, so they ignored them.
 ""People would actually remove and destroy the skin that's been preserved in order to get to the bones,"" Bell said.
 Modern preparation has the potential to lead to a deeper understanding of dinosaurs, he said. ""There's going to be no end of new and very surprising discoveries to come,"" Bell said.
 The researchers report their findings today (Dec. 12) in the journal Current Biology.

731,SCIENCE,Prostate Adventures: Another Reason to Appreciate the California Stem Cell Program,"Don C. Reed, Contributor
Sponsor, California’s Roman Reed Spinal Cord Injury Research A...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/prostate-adventures-anoth_us_5baebdd4e4b014374e2ec7eb,"Cancer is tough to kill. It may go into remission and come back later. Fortunately, the California stem cell program is pretty tough too.",2014-01-25,TECH & SCIENCE,"""Scoot your bottom over,"" said the nurse as I lay on my side in the backless hospital gown.
I felt a sudden inclination to resist. Maybe if I just said no, got up and put my clothes on, I could walk out of there, and life would go back to normal.
But the moment passed. I did as requested, and the Roto-Rooter sample takers invaded, taking 12 little chunks out of me. If that sounds gross and terrifying (and mildly painful), you have an accurate assessment of the situation.
The test results came back, and an appointment was set up -- immediately.
""You have cancer,"" the doctor said by way of greeting.
Since an estimated 90 percent of all males get prostate cancer if they live long enough, I was not immediately concerned. But when he mentioned some actual numbers, he had my undivided attention.
This year, roughly 240,000 male Americans will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 30,000 will die of it.
Because prostate cancer is generally slow-growing, many don't know they have it, and they die of old age; the cancer was there, but it just did not give them problems.
But for some, the cancer must be dealt with. One important measuring device is called the Gleason score, which ranges from 1 (no problem) to 10 (the worst).
With my score of 7, some form of action was required. Options included surgery to remove the offending prostate gland, or radiation, hormone therapy, or possibly even chemotherapy, or some combination thereof. 
I went with the surgery, a ""radical prostatectomy,"" and a little robot did the cutting.
It was a nightmare with moments of comedy. My wedding ring had to come off before the surgery, and when I woke up, my first words came out in a squeaky Elmer Fudd ""you wascally wabbit"" kind of voice: ""Where is my wedding 'wing'?"" There were also some hopefully temporary side effects, like incontinence, etc.
When the prostate was dissected, it showed a more aggressive cancer than they'd hoped to find: On the Gleason scale it was an 8 instead of a 7.
Best-case scenario? Hopefully the cancer is gone, removed with the prostate gland. 
But if the cancer has spread, I will probably need radiation therapy. This is not fun: six weeks of daily sessions, with such possible side effects as rectal cancer.
If I need it, the highly targeted radiation should kill most of the cancer, maybe enough to keep me healthy for five, 10, 15 years or more. It's hard to tell. 
Cancer is tough to kill. It may go into remission and come back later.
Fortunately, the California stem cell program is pretty tough too. 
The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) has several projects that have suddenly become of great interest to me. 
One is pioneering Stanford scientist Dr. Irv Weissman's work, which I wrote about previously.
Another, led by Dr. Owen Witte of UCLA, involves signals that turn cancer on -- and, hopefully, off.
To say Witte is a qualified researcher is like saying Mount Everest is a decent-sized hill. The author or co-author of 363 published papers, Dr. Witte is the director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research.
If I were to list all his awards, accomplishments and responsibilities, there would be no room for the blog post. 
The research that may one day save lives or ease suffering? Let's take a look.
With a CIRM Basic Biology IV grant (#RB4-06209) of $1,254,960, Dr. Witte is studying the pathways of cancer.
Do you know how the male hippopotamus fights? The giant water mammals come up on dry land and charge each other on paths worn down by their bodies, crashing together. The winners get to mate, so they fight hard -- but they do not kill each other. When one loses, it just leaves the pathway.
Dr. Witte identified ""important signaling pathways that regulate (the) growth of normal prostate tissue stem cells ... Human cancers utilize these same pathways to promote malignancy and ... tumor progression.""
When cancer comes, it ""dysregulates"" the pathways.
How to stop the cancer and let the good stem cells control the pathways?
Our recent studies have uncovered an important ... molecule (Trop 2) that is expressed on ... prostate cancer cells ... [It] is selected for ... advanced disease and predicts poor prognosis for many tumors including prostate, ovarian, pancreatic, breast, gastric and colorectal cancer. 
Dr. Witte gave me a highly scientific explanation of how Trop 2 activates cancer, which I will share in a moment. 
But I understand it like a video game my granddaughter plays, which I call ""Fruits and Bombs."" On the screen pop up a bunch of watermelons, pineapples, grapes -- and cartoon bombs. You run your fingers across the screen, slashing the fruits, but if you touch a bomb, it explodes, and you lose.
For Trop 2 to activate the cancer, it has to be slashed (cleavage) by enzymes called proteases. If we can prevent the slashing, we might also block the cancer.
Now, for the scientists in the audience, here are Dr. Witte's words.
Trop 2 requires cleavage ... to activate its growth-promoting (including cancer-causing--DR) properties.Trop 2 is a molecule that crosses the cell membrane. ... To send its growth signal, a sequence of cuts have to be done on the molecule. These are carried out by enzymes called proteases. One is located outside the cell and it cuts first. Then a second protease cuts inside the cell and a fragment of the Trop 2 moves to the nucleus and signals for growth ... (personal communication)Our goal is to use very specific antibody molecules to block the first protease cleavage event on Trop 2 ...[Therefore] ... we are generating antibodies that will block Trop 2 activation ... We predict that blocking Trop 2 ... will be an effective strategy to prevent disease progression in prostate and other human cancers....
Dr. Witte points to the pressing need for better cancer treatments, saying: 
[Currently] advanced stages of prostate cancer are treated with hormonal therapy, which causes significant changes in mood, body weight and composition, impotence and gynecomastia [men growing breasts], in addition to the pain and suffering from the disease....
His goal? ""[T]o significantly extend life and minimize suffering of men with advanced prostate cancer."" 
And he adds, ""Many of the molecules that we are investigating are implicated in a range of tumors, suggesting that our findings may provide benefit to patients suffering from numerous cancers.""
With determination, intelligence, and passion, CIRM scientists like Owen Witte fight to solve diseases like prostate cancer -- which potentially threatens every male on the planet.
Is it any wonder I consider the California stem cell program to be the pride of our state, the glory of our nation, and a friend to all the world?

 ""I'm thrilled to share some exciting news,"" Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos wrote Friday (July 19) on his Bezos Expeditions website. ""44 years ago tomorrow [July 20] Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon, and now we have recovered a critical technological marvel that made it all possible.""
 In March 2012, the billionaire entrepreneur underwrote a private — and secret — expedition to find and recover the Apollo engines that launched astronauts Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins to the moon. [Apollo 11 Moon Rocket's F-1 Engines Explained (Infographic)]
 After their fuel was spent, the 12.2-foot-wide-by-18.5-foot-tall (3.7 by 5.6 m) F-1 engines were allowed to drop into the Atlantic Ocean. The force of the impact with the water and their ensuing plunge to the seafloor 14,000 feet (4,300 m) below the surface ripped apart the massive structures, leaving them almost unrecognizable.
 Corrosion removed from the base of a Saturn V engine thrust chamber recovered by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has exposed the serial number ""Unit No 2044"" stamped into the part's surface.
 In March 2013, Bezos revealed that his team had raised the parts for at least two F-1 engines, but they didn't know if they were from Apollo 11 or one of the 12 other Saturn V rockets that flew between 1967 and 1973, each equipped with five of the engines.
 ""There was one secret that the ocean didn't give up easily: mission identification,"" Bezos wrote on his website. ""The components' fiery end and heavy corrosion from 43 years underwater removed or covered up most of the original serial numbers.""
 The job of identifying the heritage of the thrust chambers, gas generators, injectors, heat exchangers, turbines, fuel manifolds and dozens of other F-1 engine artifacts fell to the conservation team at the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center in Hutchinson, Kansas. In addition to their work cleaning and stabilizing the parts for public display, the conservators were tasked with meticulously inspecting and documenting each component.
 ""One of the conservators who was scanning the objects with a black light and a special lens filter has made a breakthrough discovery – '2044' – stenciled in black paint on the side of one of the massive thrust chambers,"" wrote Bezos. ""2044 is the Rocketdyne [company] serial number that correlates to NASA number 6044, which is the serial number for F-1 Engine #5 from Apollo 11.""
 After removing more corrosion from the base of the same thrust chamber, the conservator also found ""Unit No 2044"" stamped into the massive engine part's metal surface.
 ""Huge kudos to the conservation team,"" Bezos exclaimed on his Expeditions site. ""Conservation is painstaking work that requires remarkable levels of patience and attention to detail, and these guys have both.""
 The team at the Kansas Cosmosphere expects that it will take about two years to complete the conservation of the engines. During that time, the public can view the parts and see the work being done to preserve them through a special tour offered at the museum's SpaceWorks facility.
 A website with a live camera view of the same facility is also being developed.
 The conservation work is being done under an agreement between Bezos and NASA. The space agency is retaining ownership of the artifacts and will ultimately decide where they go on museum display.
 In addition to the National Air and Space Museum, Bezos earlier expressed interest in having one of the engine's parts displayed at The Museum of Flight in Seattle, which is located near Amazon's headquarters and the offices of Blue Origin, the commercial spaceflight company founded by Bezos in 2000.
 That at least one of the F-1 thrust chambers is now known to have flown on Apollo 11 adds to the historical significance to the engine parts' eventual exhibit.
 ""This is a big milestone for the project and the whole team couldn't be more excited to share it with you all,"" Bezos stated.
 Take a look at the F-1 engine parts being conserved at the Kansas Cosmosphere's SpaceWorks Observation Gallery.

When a probe passes near,2013-07-21,TECH & SCIENCE,"Ever wonder if aliens have been spying on us? You're not alone. In a provocative new paper, a pair of astrophysicists consider the possibility that intelligent alien beings could have built a fleet of self-replicating space probes that use gravity to sling themselves from star to star.
""We're saying that if aliens build self-replicating probes, they could explore the entire Milky Way in about ten million years,"" study co-author Dr. Duncan Forgan, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Edinburgh’s Institute for Astronomy, told The Huffington Post in an email. 
Ten million years is a relatively short timespan, given that scientists estimate the universe is around 13.8 billion years old.
How could such probes make copies of themselves? Dr. Duncan said that we humans seem to be closing in on the necessary technology ourselves, and ""with current 3D printing tech, it might only be a century or two before humans figure it out!"" 
Travel by slingshot effect -- also called gravity assist -- isn't as wacky as it sounds either. When a probe passes near a planet, it can get a boost in speed from the planet's gravity. NASA has exploited the phenomenon on many occasions--perhaps most notably with the Voyager I and II space probes. Launched in 1977, the probes used gravity assist to reach the edge of our solar system.
Alien probes using the same slingshot maneuvers wouldn't have to depend on powerful engines or massive amounts of fuel. And they could explore the galaxy 100 times faster than probes navigated by powered flight, Dr. Duncan said.
The paper, entitled ""Slingshot Dynamics for Self-Replicating Probes and the Effect on Exploration Timescales,"" was published in the International Journal of Astrobiology.

So isn't it about time foraging was changed too?
An interactive crowd-sourced map called Falling Fruit allows urban foragers to map out and review locations around the world where the public can find free fruits, vegetables and herbs growing in their area.
There are also listings for free markets and dumpsters that potentially contain edibles -- 2,181 dumpsters, to be exact.
The volunteer-run nonprofit, based out of Boulder, Colorado, currently boasts 1,317 different types of edibles in more than 790,443 locations.
The U.S. easily has the most posts, with 465,000 locations flagged on the west coast -- most being in southern California and Washington state -- and 310,000 in the Northeast.
Outside the U.S., western Europe has the second most locations with 12,000 listings, followed by 2,000 in Australia, 115 off Africa’s south-east coast, 93 in northern Argentina, 79 in Thailand and 18 in Finland.
“Some of the best mangoes in Panama!” one review for a mango tree along the Panama Canal reads.
A review for a mango tree on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean reads: “The tree is right beside the road, mangos on the floor. Watch out for the ants, they really bite!”
According to the website’s public database, the most common plants listed are honey locust trees, followed by small-leaved linden, sugar maple, cherry plum and ginkgo trees.
There are also more recognizable food items listed, like apples, pears, cherries, olives, pecans, and even places to find fish.
The website, which launched in 2013, states that its goal is to offer ""not just a free lunch"" but to ""facilitate intimate connections between people, food, and the natural organisms growing in our neighborhoods.""
It advises that the map won’t be 100 percent accurate, but that’s why they encourage the public to help with its edits and reviews. Some users even share photos of their finds.

735,SCIENCE,Unusual Asteroid Could Be An Interstellar Guest To Our Solar System,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unusual-asteroid-could-be-interstellar-guest-to-our-solar-system_us_5b02dd86e4b0463cdba4a1de,"The supposed ""interstellar immigrant"" is located near Jupiter but has an atypical orbit.",2018-05-21,TECH & SCIENCE,"Researchers postulate that a peculiar asteroid spotted near Jupiter is a permanent guest from a completely different solar system.
In an article published Monday in the U.K.’s Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, the researchers say their studies indicate that asteroid 2015 BZ509 (nicknamed BZ) is actually an “interstellar immigrant” that has been circling the sun ever since our solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the researchers, Fathi Namouni of France’s Côte d’Azur Observatory, told HuffPost that would make the discovery the first of its kind. 
“There is no other asteroid in the solar system that moves around the sun and is known to have been born outside the solar system,” he wrote in an email. 
BZ was discovered in 2014, according to The New York Times. The asteroid, a little less than two miles wide, is located near Jupiter and circles the sun every 11.6 years.
Scientists noticed that BZ has an unusual orbit. Instead of circling around the sun in the same direction as Jupiter, BZ has a retrograde orbit, meaning it circles the sun in the opposite direction. 
Namouni and the co-author of Monday’s article, Helena Morais of Brazil’s Universidade Estadual Paulista, were curious about why the asteroid moved in this unusual way. Using a time machine-like simulation, they recreated BZ’s possible movements over the past 4.5 billion years using their knowledge of the asteroid’s current orbit. 
“Surprisingly we found going back 4.5 billion years in the past, that the asteroid was moving exactly where it is now,” Namouni wrote. “But at 4.5 billion years in the past, all solar system objects, planets, asteroids and comets moved exactly in the same direction around the sun. This tells us that the asteroid was not born in the solar system but captured from outside it.”
Other astrophysicists have come up with alternate explanations for BZ’s retrograde orbit and suggested, for example, that the object could have come from the Oort Cloud, an icy mass of debris that some astronomers propose exists near the outer reaches of the solar system. Others say BZ could have come from Planet Nine, a hypothetical, hidden planet that some claim could lie beyond the dwarf planet Pluto. 
Regardless, Namouni believes BZ holds a wealth of information for scientists. Its relative proximity to Earth means scientists could analyze an object potentially from an alien solar system without needing to leave our own. Namouni said a robotic mission to BZ is “perfectly possible” with current technology.
Analyzing the asteroid’s chemical composition could help scientists understand how our own solar system formed ― and even provide insights into the origin of life. For example, if scientists discover that BZ contains water, it could signal that interstellar asteroids can deliver water to Earth and “hence indirectly contribute to the appearance of life,” Namouni wrote.

736,SCIENCE,Here's Proof That Beautiful Math Equations Affect The Brain Just Like Great Art,David Freeman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beautiful-math-equations-brain-great-art_us_5baebe47e4b014374e2ed21a,"Srinivasa Ramanujan’s infinite series of 1/pi, which was rated as the ugliest mathematical formula. Mathematicians sometimes",2014-02-17,TECH & SCIENCE,"What's beautiful to you? A sunset? The face of a loved one? A favorite poem or song? 
Mathematicians sometimes say they find beauty in mathematical formulas, and a new brain scan study confirms that equations can activate the brain in much the same way that great art does.
""To many of us, mathematical formulae appear dry and inaccessible, but to a mathematician an equation can embody the quintessence of beauty,"" study author Dr. Semir Zeki, professor of neuroesthetics at University College London, said in a written statement. ""The beauty of a formula may result from simplicity, symmetry, elegance or the expression of an immutable truth.""
For the study, which was published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, Zeki and his colleagues recruited from local colleges 16 male and female mathematicians between the ages of 22 and 32. The mathematicians were asked to review 60 mathematical formulas and to rate them on a scale ranging from minus five (ugly) to plus five (beautiful). Two weeks later they re-rated the equations while in a functional MRI (fMRI) scanner.
fMRI scanners show neurological activity by measuring changes in the flow of blood inside the brain. The scans in the study showed that appreciating beautiful formulas is correlated with activity in the medial orbito-frontal cortex, a region at the front of the brain. Appreciating art or music is correlated with activity in that same region.
Srinivasa Ramanujan's infinite series (below) and Riemann's functional equation didn't fare well in the study. They were rated ugliest.
 Srinivasa Ramanujan’s infinite series of 1/pi, which was rated as the ugliest mathematical formula.
Which of the 60 math formulas were rated as especially beautiful? There were three: the Pythagorean identity, the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and Leonhard Euler's identity (see above, top).
""It's a real classic, and you can do no better than that,"" Dr. David Percy, a professor affiliated with the Institute of Mathematics and Its Applications in the U.K., told the BBC about Euler's identity. ""It is simple to look at and yet incredibly profound, it comprises the five most important mathematical constants... It also comprises the three most basic arithmetic operations--addition, multiplication, and exponentiation.""
Dr. Steven Strogatz, professor of applied mathematics at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, offered a different take on the new research. ""Some beautiful equations are like art, but others are more like great jokes,"" he told The Huffington Post in an email. ""They're surprising and true at the same time. That's what makes them so delightful.""
