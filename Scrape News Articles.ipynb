       "['My first sleep log was five hours and four minutes. I was disappointed but also fascinated. My new Fitbit recorded how long I was asleep and how many times I was restless (19) ― just by wearing it to bed. But there was no ignoring my poor sleep habits. My bedtime read: 3:30 a.m. I was determined to do better.\\nMost basic health advice, whether your goal is getting better skin, losing weight or feeling more productive at work, includes some variation on sleeping more. But despite clear guidelines ― adults should get seven to nine hours ― a lot of people miss the mark. According to Gallup, 40 percent of Americans get less than the recommended amount of sleep, up from 11 percent 70 years ago.\\nI’m in the sleep-deprived camp. I know this not only because I rely on coffee to get me through the day, but also because my sleep tracker tells me.\\nEven though technology is a big reason we’re sleeping less, we’re using it to help us solve the problem: Wearable devices let us set sleep goals and keep us on track.\\nWhen I discovered the sleep tracking feature on my Fitbit, I became a little obsessed — it was like a game, and I wanted to beat my score each night. I taunted my boyfriend: I was so much more evolved than he was! I was becoming a well-oiled machine! I could read my diagnostics and know that I had won the day.\\nBut as time went on, my feelings of triumph faded: My score didn’t change much. I got about 70 percent “quality sleep” every night, even though I sent myself to bed earlier and tried my best to hit my sleep goal. That’s because sleep tracking is different from logging your workouts or counting your steps. You can’t just will yourself to sleep more when you know you’re not getting enough. And if you try, it could make everything worse.\\nPeople with anxiety or who have Type-A personalities may see their sleep score and panic, said Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a pulmonary and sleep doctor at the University of Southern California.\\n“They see this number and they’re like, ‘Oh my god 70. I’m going to work twice as hard to [improve].’ And they get this anxiety towards sleep based upon this number,” he said. “Sleep is not as easy as you think for something so simple.”\\nTracking doesn’t necessarily lead to more sleep\\nUnless you’re wearing a fitness tracker that automatically tracks your sleep, it takes work to log your hours digitally. Apps on your phone and the Apple Watch require you to not only keep your device by your bedside (which, let’s be honest, most of us do even though we know it’s bad sleep etiquette), they also need you to tap when you hit the sack and again when you wake up.\\n“I was so wrapped in remembering to tap the thing — it gave me insomnia,” said Lisa Munro, 41, who has struggled with sleep for several years. “It just ended up causing so much stress.”\\nEven though she uses a Fitbit now, Munro doesn’t focus on her score in the morning.\\n“There’s still that anxiety because you’re like, did I get more sleep than yesterday? You still get kind of worked up about it. I feel like one of the worst things to do is fret about your insomnia because then you really can’t sleep,” she said.\\nAnother problem with worrying about your sleep score is the fact that digital devices have mixed results when it comes to tests for accuracy. It might be exciting to wake up and see how long you were in each stage of sleep, but a truly accurate reading requires a traditional sleep study, Dr. Dasgupta said.\\n“When we talk about REM sleep, I have to look at your eye movements,” he said. “I have to look at characteristic waves on the EEG. I have to look for a decrease in the muscle tone.” \\nAnd it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy when you wake up and see you didn’t reach your target.\\n“It sets you up,” said Munro. “Even if you don’t feel really tired, you’re still like, ‘I only got seven hours of sleep. This is going to be a terrible day.’”\\nThat number is in the healthy range, but it’s on the lower end and may not be enough for some people. And it’s enough to raise anxiety if it’s not quite meeting your goal.\\nFor those who have trouble sleeping, using trackers to try to solve the issue can also be a deterrent from seeking help from a physician. That’s a problem, since insomnia can have a deeper cause than simply a lack of willpower to get to bed earlier.\\n“Any device that encourages you to get good sleep, that makes you want to exercise, I’m on that team,” said Dr. Dasgupta. “But you have to know its limitations.”\\nEven though my sleep quality stays at about 70 percent and I rarely, if ever, hit eight hours, I’m not beating myself up. I’ve realized that instead of fixating on your score each morning, it’s more helpful to use a sleep tracker to gauge general patterns. It’s more important to pay attention to how you feel — not the number on that little screen on your wrist.\\n',\n",
       " 'A new exhibition in Berlin’s neighborhood of Schöneberg epitomizes one of the central schisms that has vibrated through Street Art and graffiti for years: the question of where to draw boundaries between these two scenes.\\nEach may have been born in the margins of society but are now evermore commingled. Debates aside, everyone agrees that once in the gallery space, street become fine art after all. “The graffiti and Street Art movements – they have all these tentacles and they can be non-linear,” Evan says as we walk down a subterranean parking ramp to see a low, long outdoor mural by Sweden’s EKTA; an abstract series of roughly square patches that closely emulate the sewn panels he has suspended from the ceiling inside the gallery.\\nAs Editor-in-Chief of the San Francisco based art magazine Juxtapoz and curator of this “What in the World” show at Urban Nation’s project space, Evan Pricco is well aware of the landmines that can explode when one is negotiating the terminologies and practices of sundry sub-cultural art manifestations that have bubbled to the surface in the last decades and which now often melt with one another inextricably.\\n“The graffiti and Street Art movements – they have all these tentacles and they can be non-linear,” Evan says as we walk down a subterranean parking ramp to see a low, long outdoor mural by Sweden’s EKTA; an abstract series of roughly square patches that closely emulate the sewn panels he has suspended from the ceiling inside the gallery.\\nSpeaking of the tentacles, he continues, “It can be starting points to end points – it can be end points to starting points. There are all of these different cultures that grew out of that 1970s-80s set of counter-culture art movements.\\n“I think the people that I really wanted in this show are kind of on the periphery of that. They clearly dip their toe into those movements, are clearly influenced by them. Their practice doesn’t necessarily fit in with what is going on in Street Art and graffiti but also its informed by it.”\\nTo introduce a new crop of artists to Urban Nation that haven’t been shown here yet, Pricco choses some of Europes street/mural/conceptual artists who emphasize color and mood, an expansionist approach that he welcomes at the magazine as well. Not surprisingly, the range reflects some of the same interests you’ll find flipping through the influential art publication; old school graffiti, commercial illustration, comic book history, abstract fine art, political art, some lowbrow, some conceptual. There is even Grotesk’s newsstand, the actual one that he designed and constructed with Juxtapoz that sat in Times Square in October 2015.\\nPrimarily from Europe and raised in the hothouse of the 1990s epic graffiti scenes that enthralled youth in many EU big cities, this group of 7 artists each has moved their practice forward – which may lose them some street cred and gather new audiences.\\nIncluded are Berlin’s Daan Botlek, Sweden’s EKTA, Ermsy from France, Erosie from the Netherlands, Hyuro from Spain, Serge Lowrider from Switzerland and Zio Ziegler from the US. If you speak to any of them, you may find the commonality is the freedom they actively give themselves to pursue an autonomous artistic route not easily categorized.\\nLowrider is clearly in love with the letter-form, as is the graffiti tradition, but he steers sharply toward the calligraphic practices of crisp sign-painting and inverting the pleasantly banal messaging of advertising from an earlier era. Perhaps the tight line work overlaps with tattoo and skater culture, two creative brethren frequently in the mix in graffiti and Street Art scenes.\\nHyuro uses a figurative symbolism heavy with metaphor and a color palette that is too understated for the flashy graphics that many associate with today’s mural festivals, yet she’s built a dedicated following among Street Art fans who admire her poke-you-in-the-eye activist streak. Daan Botleks’ figures wander and cavort amidst an abstractedly shaped world calling to mind the shading of early graffiti and the volumizing pointillism of Seurat after some wine.\\nPainter Jeroen Erosie emphatically will tell you that he was in love with graffiti when he first did it on the streets as a teenager – and for many years afterwards. But he says he ultimately bristled at a scene that had once symbolized freedom to him but had become too rigid and even oppressive in its rules about how aesthetics should be practiced by people – if they were to earn respect within the clan.\\nAt Saturday nights opening along Bülowstrasse with the front doors open to the busy street and with the sound of the elevated train swooshing by overhead, Erosie explained with a gleeful certainty his process of deconstruction that led him to this point. “I removed one of the pillars of graffiti from my work and I liked the result, the change. So I started to remove more pillars, one by one,” he says, describing the evolution that transformed his letter forms and colors into these simplified and bold bi-color icons that may call to mind Matisse’s cut outs more than graffiti bubble-tags, but you’ll easily draw the correlation if you try.\\nThe Project M series of exhibitions over the past three years with Urban Nation, of which this is the 12th, have featured curators and artists from many backgrounds, disciplines, and geographies as well. The myriad styles shown have included sculpture, stencil, wheat paste, collage, calligraphy, illustration, screen-printing, decoupage, aerosol, oil painting, and even acrylic brush. It has been a carefully guided selection of graffiti/Street Art/urban art/fine art across the 12 shows; all presented respectfully cheek to jowl, side by side – happily for some, uncomfortably for others.\\nThe ultimate success of the Project M series, initiated by UN Artistic Director Yasha Young, is evident in just how far open it has flung the doors of expectation to the museum itself. When the house opens in four months it will be a reflection to some extent 140 or so artists who pushed open those doors with variety of styles emblematic of this moment - converging into something called Urban Contemporary.\\n“What in the World” indeed: this show is in perfect alignment with the others in its wanton plumbing of the genres.\\n“I was trying to find people that are not part of the regular circuit – and I don’t mean that in a negative way but I mean there is kind of a regular circuit of muralism and Street Art right now – but I was looking for people who are really sort of on that periphery,” Pricco says. “Also because they are coming from these different parts of Europe, which to me sort of represents Juxtpoz’ reach, and they all kind of know each other but they’ve never really met – they all kind of bounce off of each other.”\\nBrooklyn Street Art: This grouping sounds anathema to the loyalty that is often demanded by these scenes – particularly the various graffiti scenes in cities around the world. You are describing an artistic practice that has a sort of casual relationship to that scene. \\nEvan Pricco: Right. And I think all of these artists have these graffiti histories but they weren’t completely satisfied with that kind of moniker or label. So it is slightly expanding out now. And then there’s something about them that makes me think of crafts, especially with Serge who is more of a sign-painter. I felt that all of these people approached their work in a way that felt very craft-oriented to me, and I really appreciated that. That’s kind of what I wanted to show too.\\nBrooklyn Street Art: Each of these artists appears to have a certain familiarity with the art world that is outside a more strict definition of street culture – graffiti and Street Art and their tributaries. Would you say that you could see a certain development of personal style in this collection of primarily European artists that might be due to exposure to formal art history or other cultural influences?\\nEvan Pricco: Good question, and that could be the case for a few of the artists in the show, but I think the characteristics of each artist in the show is more of a result of the world getting smaller and influences and boundaries just blurring. You can see it Ermsy’s pop-culture mash-ups, or Erosie’s exploration of lettering and color; it’s not really about one place anymore but a larger dialogue of how far the work reaches now than ever before.\\nErosie and I were having this conversation this morning about this, this idea of access and influences being so widespread. And that is exactly what I wanted to do. “What In the World” is sort of a nod to not really having to have boundaries, or a proper definition, but a feeling that something is happening. Its not Street Art, its not graffiti, but its this new wave that is looking out, looking in, and finding new avenues to share and make work.\\nBrooklyn Street Art: From comic books to politics to activism to abstract to sign painting, this show spans the Hi-Low terrain that Juxtapoz often seeks to embrace in many ways. Is it difficult to find common threads or narratives when countenancing such variety?\\nEvan Pricco: We have been so fortunate with the magazine that we have been able to expand the content in the last few years, and the threads are starting to connect solely based on the idea that the creative life is what you make of it. There may not be a direct connection between Serge Lowrider and Mark Ryden, but there is a connection in the idea of craftsmanship and skill and how one goes about applying that skill in the art world. That is always wanted I wanted to help bring to Juxtapoz – this idea that variety in the art world is healthy and finds its own connections just in the fact that it exists and is being made.\\nBrooklyn Street Art: Many of these names are not household names, though some have ardent fans within more narrow channels of influence. What role does a curator play by introducing these artworks/artists to a new audience and what connections would you like a viewer to make? \\nEvan Pricco: First and foremost, these are some of my absolute favorite artists making work right now. I do have the advantage of traveling a lot and meeting different people and seeing their process, but I really wanted to bring together a group that I hadn’t personally met but admired and communicated with from afar.\\nI was thinking about this when I walked by Hyuro’s wall this morning. Her work is incredibly strong, and it has this really fascinating way of being a story and narrative from wall to wall while remaining fresh and really site-specific. Her work here just blew me away; its so subtle, has this really unique almost anonymous quality to it, but has a ton of thought and heart in it.\\nReally it would be great if the audience sees this and finds her other work, and starts seeing this really beautiful story emerging, these powerful political, social and economic commentaries. So really, I want that. I want this to be a gateway of looking at work and artists and then jumping into their really fantastically complex careers.\\nBrooklyn Street Art: Urban Nation has invited curators from around the world and Berlin during these 12 “Project M” shows, each with a take on what “art in the streets” is, how it has evolved, and how it is affecting contemporary art. What makes this show stand out? \\nEvan Pricco: I really do think what makes it stand out is that it represents all the things Juxtapoz stands for; Opening up an audience to something new and different. I think there is an aesthetic that the Project M shows have had, which I like, but I didn’t want to repeat what everyone had done before.\\nThis is most definitely a Juxtapoz show; I mean our damned Newsstand that Grotesk designed is right in the middle of the space. But that is like this “representation” of the print mag, and all the walls around it are the avenues the magazine can take you; sign painting, textiles, graffiti, abstraction, conceptual art, murals, comics, politics. … So maybe in that way, the fact that the magazine is 23 years old and has covered such a big history of Lowbrow, Graffiti and other forms of art, this is a nice encapsulation of the next wave and generation.\\n“What In the World: The Juxtapoz Edition” presented by Urban Nation will be on display through June 2017. \\n____________________\\nPlease note: All content including images and text are © BrooklynStreetArt.com, unless otherwise noted.

       " 'Many Americans are puzzled by the all-out attacks by the Trump administration on contraceptive services: the administration has signaled its intention to take contraception  out of the list of no co-pay preventive services authorized by Obamacare; it has made clear its eagerness to defund Planned Parenthood; and it has appointed longtime ideological opponents of contraception to positions of power in the federal bureaucracy, including direct oversight of family planning programs. The question becomes, why is an administration firmly opposed to abortion taking steps that will only assure more unintended pregnancies, some of which in turn will lead to an increased demand for abortions? What became of that short-lived moment in American politics when contraception was viewed as the main point of “common ground” between supporters and opponents of abortion? The answer, simply put, lies in the ascendancy of the religious right as a dominant force in the Republican party.\\nA look at three generations of the Bush political dynasty is telling about the fate of support for contraception among Republican politicians, and the end of such common ground. In the 1940s, Prescott Bush, a senator from Connecticut, served as national treasurer of the recently founded Planned Parenthood Federation of America. In 1970, his son, George H.W. Bush, then a Congressman from Texas, was the Republican sponsor of a bipartisan bill, Title X of the Public Health Act, the first legislation that authorized federal spending to make family planning services available to low income women (and later, to teenagers as well). Title X, it bears mentioning, was signed by a Republican president, Richard Nixon. As for Congressman Bush, he was such an avid promoter of contraception that his nickname in the House was “Rubbers.”  Neither Bush nor some others who voted for Title X supported the legalization of abortion that would occur shortly, but they all agreed on the desirability of preventing unwanted pregnancy.\\nBut when George W. Bush, grandson of Prescott and son of the first President Bush, was president from 2000-2008, his administration was marked by a deep hostility to contraception and a willingness to rely on “junk science” to discredit it: for example, domestically his administration funneled millions of dollars to “abstinence only” programs that promoted false information about the effectiveness of condoms, both with respect to pregnancy prevention and HIV prevention. And in the 2016 election cycle, his brother Jeb, a presidential candidate, scornfully told a conservative group, “I’m not sure we need half a billion dollars for women’s health issues,” and made clear his determination to defund Planned Parenthood.\\nWhat happened in the period between the senior Bush’s promotion of contraception and the third generation’s repudiation of it? This dramatic shift cannot be understood apart from the rise, starting in the 1970s, of the religious right as a powerful force that Republican politicians ignored at their peril. Beginning with the Reagan presidential campaign in 1980, this movement has acted as a disciplined voting bloc. And while opposition to abortion was the key defining issue for this ascendant movement, contraception, from the beginning, was a target as well.\\nNot surprisingly, Planned Parenthood, as a major provider of contraceptive services, quickly became demonized. Even before most Planned Parenthood affiliates began to offer abortion, the religious right opposed the organization because of the confidential services that were provided to teens, the nonjudgmental information about sexuality offered to its patients, and—particularly enraging—the fact that Planned Parenthood received public funding as a Title X provider. This statement, from a fundraising appeal of an anti-abortion group in 1980, is illustrative of the range of accusations which some religious conservatives leveled against the organization: “Planned Parenthood promotes sexual perversion, homosexuality, pornography, abortion, family destruction, population control.”\\nIn the years since the emergence of the religious right in the 1970s, some within the movement have escalated their critique of contraception. From initially opposing contraception because it facilitated out of wedlock sex, to later also claiming that use of contraception supports an “abortion mentality,” more recently an additional argument against contraceptive methods is that they themselves should be understood as “abortifacients.” This argument, typically applied to emergency contraception, intrauterine devices (“IUDs”) and other hormonal methods (including, by some opponents, “regular” birth control pills), rests on the view that pregnancy occurs at the moment sperm and egg meet. This view is at odds with the long established medical principle that pregnancy begins with the implantation of a fertilized egg.\\nWhile abortion remains a divisive issue in American society, the desirability of contraceptive use is a nearly universally held value. As a Center for Disease Control report states, “Virtually all women of reproductive age in 2006-2010 who had ever had sexual intercourse used at least one contraceptive method at some point in their lifetime.” But given that 45 percent of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended, clearly many women need help in obtaining the most effective (and expensive) methods. Should their reproductive health needs be held hostage to a movement that has a non-scientific understanding of contraception but an outsize influence on Republican electoral politics?\\nCarole Joffe is a professor in the Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco.

       " 'WASHINGTON -- Vester Lee Flanagan, the man who allegedly shot and killed two journalists during a live broadcast on Wednesday, had once filed an extensive lawsuit against a former employer -- not the one targeted by Wednesday\\'s shooting -- alleging that he was a victim of racism.\\nA Twitter account linked to Flanagan also claimed on Wednesday that one of the victims of the shooting \"made racist comments.\" \\nFlanagan was a reporter for WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia, until 2013. He is suspected of killing WDBJ reporters Alison Parker, 24, and cameraman Adam Ward, 27, before dying of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Twitter and Facebook accounts bearing his name and photo posted a video that appears to show the double murder.\\nFlanagan filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida in March 2000 against WTWC-TV. According to court documents, Flanagan, who is black, had been employed at WTWC as a newscaster and anchor. He alleged racism in his workplace and retaliation for reporting it. The parties reached a settlement, the terms of which were not disclosed.\\nIn the lawsuit, Flanagan claimed that a producer called him a \"monkey\" and that he was \"made aware that other black employees ... had been called monkeys by officials affiliated with defendant.\"\\nHe said a white \"official\" told him that \"it busted her butt that blacks did not take advantage of the free money,\" referring to scholarship funds available to African-Americans. He also claimed that a supervisor said that \"blacks are lazy.\"\\nWTWC-TV denied both of these claims in a court filing. \\nFlanagan also claimed that another employee told a black tape operator to \"stop talking ebonics.\" WTWC-TV acknowledged that an employee \"may have made similar comments to another employee,\" but denied that such comments are \"indicative of unlawful employment practices.\" \\nFlanagan contended that he notified WTWC-TV that he planned to file a discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and that afterward he was fired.\\nAt the time, the news station denied that his termination was the result of discrimination. It instead cited \"poor performance,\" budgetary reasons and \"misbehavior with regards to co-workers.\"\\nThe station did not respond to HuffPost\\'s request for comment on Wednesday.\\nCivil court records also show that Flanagan sued Jeffrey Marks, the head of WDBJ, claiming that station owed him money. The lawsuit was filed in March 2014, one year after he was fired from the Roanoke station. The case was ultimately dismissed. WDBJ did not immediately return requests for comment.\\nOn the day of the shooting, the Twitter account associated with Flanagan also implied that one of the shooting victims had an \"EEOC report\" filed against her.\\n\"Why were they the targets and not I?\" Marks asked on CNN on Wednesday, referring to Parker and Ward. He said he was unsure if Flanagan and Parker had even worked at the station at the same time. \"They could have overlapped, I just don\\'t have a strong recollection of that,\" he said. \\nA spokesperson for the EEOC told HuffPost that in general, complaints filed with the agency are private. \\nArthur Delaney contributed to this report.\\nThis is a breaking story and will be updated as information becomes available.\\nAlso on HuffPost:\\n',\n",

       " 'This piece is by Tamron Hall, co-host of Today Show and host of MSNBC’s NewsNation \\nI often joke that I am a country mouse in the city. They say a joke is funny because it is based in fact. Little of my “country mouse side”, as I call it, is visible today. When you watch me on the “Today Show” or “NewsNation” it\\'s probably the last thing you would say about me. Long gone are the days I would play in front of my grandfather\\'s home in Luling, Texas with little more than a stick and a water hose to cool off in the hot South Texas sun.\\nIn Luling our streets were unpaved until the eighties. Sharp white stones that crackled under the weight of cars passing were my playground. My grandfather\\'s shotgun home painted grey and trimmed in a light pink was the standard for the neighborhood. The backyard had no fence and there was a huge propane tank in the back. The tank was used as a hurdle and fake horse by my cousins and me. It was the most basic childhood you can imagine, yet it was all mine and all things were perfect. Each summer and nearly every holiday this tiny slice of Texas was my heaven. At the center of it all was the man who picked me up from the hospital wanting my name to be Margaret Mae Hall- the name a few close friends still call me to this day!\\nThe man who drove me and my mother home to that shotgun house was not my father. It was my grandfather or as I called him my \"Paw-Paw\"- yes, that\\'s how you say it, Paw-Paw.\\nHis name was Louis, born in 1901 in Gonzales, Texas. My mother was the baby out of 10 children. My grandmother passed away when she was just 10 years old. Her father, my Paw-Paw, would become her father and mother, a single parent. He never remarried and raised my mother alone. Then I came into the picture. When I went home that day as an infant, he was there. My parents were married, but my biological father was young and perhaps not ready. It was my Paw Paw who took me to get my first baby shots without my mother who he insisted stay home to recover. He provided my first home, that little shotgun place on the edge of town. He would sit me on his knee and feed me my first meals. No not baby food or formula. I was eating mashed sweet potatoes and anything he could make into something I could digest. My sweet tooth was a problem even then! My mother still laughs as she shares with me how my lips would smack after every bite of goodness. I learned to love food with him and became a true foodie.\\nWhen my parents finally moved from Luling my mother tells the story of how my heartbroken PawPaw begged her not to leave. We moved just a few hours away from him, but I can\\'t recall a single holiday without him.\\nMy grandfather was a true patriarch. Our family centered around him. This man with only a second grade education could not read, but his business savvy was well respected. He knew how to make the little money he had go a long way. He worked as a BBQ pit master until he was 84 and was even featured in the local paper when he retired. He is quoted as saying \"I don\\'t want to stop working even now. If I work, I am happy\".\\nI think about him often when people ask how is it that I host and work on so many shows. I get that work ethic from him and he passed it along to my mother. He taught me to expect nothing, but always be ready to help and share what you have with others. Before getting the title of BBQ man he was a share cropper and picked cotton. In that article on his retirement he also said \"I worked everywhere you put me. I\\'ve always had a job.\" My eyes right now are filled with tears thinking about this little boy who had to leave school to help his family survive. I never heard him say he regretted a single thing.\\nAfter he retired my Paw Paw came to live with us. I was in high school by then and he was amused at how I talked on the phone all night with friends and laughed so loud it would keep him up at night. I often think of him when I belt out a big laugh on the “Today Show.” What would he say?\\nWhen I got my first car he told my mother he would stay awake until he saw my headlights flash through his window. One day we hatched a plan to escape. We both wanted independence. I was a rebellious teen and he was craving the life he was no longer able to live alone. He walked to my room and dangled the keys saying let\\'s go after I had just had one of those teenager arguments with my parents. We didn\\'t make it out of the driveway, but we were ready to go.\\nI could go on and on about him. I know my mother misses him dearly. She was there as he said farewell to this part of his journey. I was away at college. I remember crying so hard I thought I was going to blackout. There was this one moment I’ve shared with only my mother until now. I felt a cool breeze in the room. he smell of the ointment he used to treat his arthritis filled the air. I felt his energy and his love and in a way I can\\'t describe to you. It was real and it confirmed he will always be with me. The lessons he taught me never die. They shape me and keep me balanced when I feel insecure.\\nOn Sunday, Sept. 7, the day we remember grandparents -- those still here and those gone -- I can say with certainty this country mouse was raised by an honorable man grounded by his faith. He believed I could be here. He knew I would be here. It\\'s an incredible bond we share with grandparents. I am lucky to have told you about mine.\\n \\n',\n",
       " 'When my colleague and friend, Jennifer Pottheiser, dreamed up the idea for the \"Olympic Moms\" series, we never thought we\\'d pull it off. It was April 20; we had exactly three months to coordinate with 17 Olympic hopefuls. Olympic athletes are incredibly busy people. Moms are incredibly busy people. But athletes that are moms? How would we squeeze into their schedules?  We soon learned that if time management was an Olympic sport, these women would all be competing for the gold. Over the past three months we\\'ve spent 14 hours with Mickey Kelly; 47 minutes with Khatuna Lorig. Olympic gold-medal favorite Lashinda Demus met us at the track on July 4 to train on what should\\'ve been a day off. Tayyiba Haneef-Park invited us to her annual July 4th picnic; we met up with Keli-Smith Puzo on the campus of her (and my) alma-mater where she was competing in a tournament - and sharing a cramped dorm with her mom and two boys. We\\'ve filmed in Colorado, California, Pennsylvania and Maryland.  The number of moms competing in the Games whittled from 17 hopefuls to 13 competitors and one alternate. A flash storm cancelled our flights to Atlanta -- and, as it would turn out, our entire shoot with high-jump favorite Chaunte Lowe. Kerri Walsh and Christie Rampone\\'s agents tried so hard to fit us in -- at one point we were scheduled with both. The moms that we didn\\'t have a chance to feature have each invited us to shoot with them after they return home from London -- and how can you say no to that? I, for one, didn\\'t want to distract Kerri Walsh in the final day before she left for London. [STORY CONTINUES BELOW PHOTOS]\\nJen first thought of this series back in 2008, but never acted on. I was traveling abroad when she asked if I wanted to help her produce it -- and fit it in before the athletes headed to London. I told her she was crazy. I\\'m a little crazy myself, so I jumped on board.\\nWhen Jen sent the first emails out to the athletes and their agents, we sat with our fingers crossed. Was this a completely bogus request? A pair of independent filmmakers want to come over before you wake up your infant; we\\'ll stick around for your eight hours of practice, dinner with your family and bedtime stories. And squeeze an interview and photoshoot in there while we\\'re at it. The first response came within an hour -- Mickey Kelly was very interested.\\nThe project wouldn\\'t have been possible without production manager Kerry Caifa. She is one of the most organized women I\\'ve ever met -- and she\\'s also a mom. Within two weeks of that April 20 email, she\\'d secured our first interview. Then there was the small question of where this would air. And how we\\'d fit it into our already-jam-packed schedules.\\nThis summer, this journey, has been incredible. It was far from ordinary -- which is just how I like to spend my summers. As a kid, I did all the regular stuff -- trips to the Jersey Shore, pool parties, riding bikes for hours on end -- but my nights were completely different from the other kids in suburbia. My siblings and I spent our summer nights watching my mom and her friends win one softball championship after the next. This year marks the 40th anniversary of Title IX -- and the 40th year for Brown\\'s Landscaping Softball Team of the venerable Rutherford Women\\'s Softball League.\\nWatching my mom and her Brown\\'s Landscaping teammates all these years, I\\'ve always understood that women don\\'t need to stop playing sports just because they want to have children, just because they want to start a family. They can absolutely do both. And, contrary to popular belief, their bodies can handle it.\\nOf course, my mom and her friends are far from being Olympic athletes. But their spirit is the same. Just like Mickey and Lashinda, Tayyiba and Danielle, they taught their daughters -- and sons-- that women can have athletic careers as long and successful as those of their male counterparts, without sacrificing their dream to start a family.\\nWhen Jen asked me to embark on this project, I couldn\\'t help but imagine what it would be like to be one of these kids; what it would be like see my mom compete in the Olympics. I thought of all the life lessons I\\'ve learned from the ladies of Brown\\'s Landscaping. Today, I wonder what Lailaa and Dontay and Lily will think when they realize that the Olympics aren\\'t something most kids share with their moms; when they realize that their moms are truly amazing. Then again, after spending just a day with of these inspirational moms, I\\'m pretty sure that their children already know that they are so lucky to call these women -- these athletes -- Mom.\\nWATCH: See all the Olympic Mom videos \\n',\n",
