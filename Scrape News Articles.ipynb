       " 'As the wildest political year in recent memory comes to an end, it’s time for politicos across the spectrum to take stock of what worked and what didn’t in our modern political era. What victories should be hailed and what mistakes should be avoided in the future? Whether you agree or disagree with any of these, everyone can acknowledge they played YUGE roles in an election year that will be talked about (and studied) for years to come.\\nThe Winners:\\nDonald Trump and The Alt-Right — Even if you think he’s just an “Orange Hitler,” you have to admit Trump’s unlikely campaign won by the rules as they were written and broke all the others. Plus he didn’t do it alone — the “alt-right” showed up in droves, generating news content, posting on social media and going to the polls in key swing states. Trump is our next president, and for good or ill, you have to give his campaign credit for winning “so big.”\\nBernie Sanders and The Progressive Movement — As with many things Bernie Sanders has fought for during his career, he’s often vindicated by hindsight. 2016 is no different, as Bernie and his movement of progressives and millennials may have lost the battle, but they’ll eventually win the war. Sanders was the outsider the Democrats needed to beat Trump — and he likely would’ve — but like his fights in Congress, he faced too much big-money opposition. But hindsight is 20/20, and if Bernie can last, it’s likely he — or his movement — will be back.\\nVladmir Putin and The Russians — As more reports emerge that the Russians “hacked” the election with anti-Hillary headlines as well as simply hacking emails, we must again give credit where it’s due even if the actions disgust us. Whether it was because of a “personal beef” with Hillary or avoiding war in Syria, Vladimir Putin now has a much more likely ally in the White House for the next four years — and the world will be very different because of it.\\nAlternative Media Outlets and Citizen Journalists — While much fuss has rightfully been made about “fake news” this election cycle, alternative media outlets played an enormous role as well. On the left, outlets like The Young Turks, The Intercept and Democracy Now! took the left to task, and on the right, Breitbart News, Infowars and James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas made (and probably created) plenty of headlines. Couple this with more citizens shooting news events on their phones, and it’s clear journalism in America has changed forever.\\nThe Libertarian Party — Yes, their presidential candidate bumbled his way out of relevance by October, but America’s largest third party also grew by leaps and bounds, almost quadrupling their previous high vote total and securing ballot access in 37 states in 2018. And while some blame their ballot presence for Trump’s win, most understand they statistically drew more Republican voters and will be the main conservatives — along with some libertarian-leaning members of Congress — to oppose Trump’s potentially unconstitutional agenda the next four years.\\nThe Losers:\\nHillary Clinton and The Democrat Establishment — No campaign blew a sure thing harder than Hillary Clinton and The Clinton Machine this year. Their arrogance and disrespect for the electoral process was on full display as they colluded with the media and Wall Street, only to lose because their candidate couldn’t connect with middle-class workers in key swing states. Naturally, since their loss they’ve blamed everyone — from the Russians to “fake news” to James Comey — except themselves. America deserves to never have to hear from any of them again.\\nJohn Kasich, Jeb! Bush and The Republican Establishment — There were plenty of losers in the Republican party this year as well (16 to be exact!) but only a few kept chips on their shoulders after the primary and even planned on a Trump loss to revitalize their careers. When that didn’t happen, it thankfully sealed the fate for such political monsters as The Bush Family and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Barring anything crazy sinking Trump’s presidency (which is totally possible) don’t plan on hearing from any of them again either.\\nMainstream/Corporate Media — No group got the election more wrong more often than our major news outlets. From The New York Times to The Washington Post and CNN, the established newspapers and networks blatantly wore their biases on their sleeves, but none of their analyses mattered in the end. While most of them bashed Trump, they still covered him relentlessly, only making him the political Frankenstein they all feared. Like The Clinton Machine, their credibility with average Americans is severely damaged, and they still don’t seem to realize it.\\nSaudi Arabia — While a lot has rightfully been made about Russia’s influence in this election, lost in the din was how much the Saudis were hoping — and banking — for a Clinton victory. Money flowed from Saudi Arabia to The Clinton Foundation before the election, and The Podesta Group took in plenty as well. The Saudis also lost important lobbying battles such as blocking 9/11 families from suing the country and keeping 28 pages of the 9/11 Commission Report (focused on the Saudis potential role) classified. Needless to say, it looks like the Saudis will have much less pull in U.S. politics for the next four years.\\nThe American People — From closed primaries to superdelegates to the two-party system and the Electoral College, the American people have been subject to a “rigged” election process that’s controlled by those at the top once again. That’s not to say the American people are exempt from sharing the blame — in a crucial election year, just over 50 percent of the eligible electorate even bothered to show up. If anything is going to adapt in our country and Americans want to prevent another 2016, we can’t just demand change — we need to make it happen ourselves.\\n',\n",
       " 'Illinois\\' medical marijuana law \"stinks\" and should have been vetoed, the state\\'s Republican gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner said during a Tuesday press conference. But medical marijuana advocates say he\\'s just grandstanding to earn votes. \\n“I don’t think Bruce Rauner has any real interest in going after those [medical marijuana] licenses or any real skin in this game — he’s just going after the governor,” Executive Director of the Illinois chapter of the National Organization For Marijuana Reform Dan Linn told The Huffington Post by phone Wednesday. \\nReading from prepared statements, Rauner blasted Illinois\\' medical marijuana pilot program as incumbent Gov. Pat Quinn\\'s (D) \"secret, insider process\" that \"leaves a lot of questions left unanswered.\" \\nThe state, which began accepting applications earlier this month, will grant licenses for up to 22 cultivation centers and 60 dispensaries across Illinois. Under the law, which passed with bipartisan support, applicants\\' names and certain other information will not be made public. \\nReferring to Illinois\\' jailed Democratic ex-governor, who is currently serving a 14-year sentence on corruption charges, Rauner called the process for awarding licenses \"so overtly corrupt, it would made Rod Blagojevich blush.\" \\nBill sponsor Rep. Lou Lang (D-Skokie)  told NBC Chicago that withholding names ensures the state will \"choose applicants that have no regard for who you are, who you know, how much money you have, what campaign donations you made and what relationships you may have in the world. The reason that the bill says what it says about disclosing this information is to keep corruption out, not lock corruption in.\"\\nCalling Rauner\\'s comments \"nine parts grandstanding, one part valid criticism,\" Linn said that while the GOP hopeful didn\\'t specify which parts of the application he thinks should be made public, there are some parts the public has a right to view. \\n“Obviously there are things you can\\'t release, like tax info or the security plan. You can\\'t have [applicants] divulge \\'We’re going to have the safes in this room,\\'\" Linn said, noting that Massachusetts\\' medical marijuana application process stripped tax and other identifying information from public record.\\n\"The public should be able to see what [an applicant\\'s] business plan is, their community support, their research plans, what they’ll do to combat any detrimental effects in the neighborhood, their horticultural experience or their track record that verifies them as legitimate growers,” he added. Linn said it wasn\\'t until Rauner\\'s comments Tuesday that the candidate was \"even on the radar\" with his opinion about the state\\'s medical marijuana law. Linn noted that if Rauner saw the application process as flawed, he could have weighed in during public hearings on the law. \\n\"There was ample time for Rauner to make comments about this — he could have done this in a press conference months ago,\" Linn said. \\nQuinn, whom NORML calls \"a strong ally\" of medical marijuana, couldn\\'t resist a jab back at Rauner. \"It\\'s heartless,\" said a statement from his campaign, that Rauner would have vetoed a law that \"will ease pain and provide relief for cancer patients (and) severely ill people.\"\\nChris Lindsey, a legislative analyst for the Marijuana Policy Project, told the Chicago Sun-Times it was \"deeply troubling\" that Rauner would suggest turning the program into a money maker:\\n\"I’m not sure he understands what the program is for. This isn’t a way to raise revenue. This is a way to provide an option to seriously ill patients. If he wants a money maker he should follow in the footsteps of Washington and Colorado and support a system to tax and regulate marijuana for adults 21 and over. States don’t treat medical marijuana programs as a way to squeeze money from seriously ill patients.”\\nThough Rauner\\'s comments were roundly criticized by medical marijuana advocates, Linn suggested one way the candidate could recover: \\n\"As a business man, he could make a strong political play and say that he would veto the medical act but support legalizing marijuana entirely and letting the free market exist for legal cannabis in Illinois.”\\n',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON -- Groundskeepers have shut off all drinking water sources inside an office building at the U.S. Capitol after routine testing revealed high levels of lead. \\nMamie Bittner, a spokeswoman for the Architect of the Capitol, said a recent water sample analysis showed that lead concentrations in the Cannon House Office Building\\'s water exceeded the federal standard of 15 parts per billion.\\n\"While these tests continue, in an abundance of caution, we have turned off all drinking water sources and office-provided water filtration units in the Cannon House Office Building,\" Bittner said in an email.\\n\"Restrooms and kitchen sinks will be available for non-drinking use and bottled water will be available throughout the building,\" Bittner wrote. \"Building operations will not be impacted. This situation only impacts the Cannon building.\"\\nLead is a poisonous metal that can cause miscarriages if pregnant women ingest it, and can damage the brains of young children. \\nCannon is one of three large buildings on the Capitol\\'s south side, where members of the House of Representatives keep offices. One member with an office there is Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) -- the congressman from Flint, Michigan, where lead has poisoned the water since 2014. \\n\"Congress has so far failed to act on Flint aid and now some Members of Congress have had their own water shut off due to high lead levels in their Washington offices,\" he said in an emailed statement. \\n\"Lead is a dangerous neurotoxin and high levels of lead in water anywhere is a public health emergency,\" Kildee said. \"It is long past time that Congress get serious about this health threat. Helping Flint families ought to be as much of a priority as ensuring safe water on Capitol Hill.\"\\nProposals to help Flint and other cities replace lead water pipes haven\\'t cleared the U.S. House or Senate. One Republican who has vocally opposed the assistance said Congress shouldn\\'t nationalize a local water problem. \\nAs many as 10 million American homes and buildings get water from pipes made of lead, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Federal law requires local water systems to monitor the water for its lead content and also its corrosiveness, since more corrosiveness means more lead can leach into the water. \\nThe EPA is considering more aggressive requirements about replacing lead pipes, something water utilities aren\\'t often forced to do.\\nThe historic neighborhood around the U.S. Capitol in Washington has lots of pipes made from lead -- which wasn\\'t banned from plumbing materials until the 1980s, despite the known dangers of lead exposure. In the early 2000s, water treatment changes made the city\\'s water more corrosive, and its lead content spiked dramatically.\\nBittner couldn\\'t provide additional information about the source of the lead in Cannon, such as whether it came from the building\\'s internal plumbing or from service lines that connect the building to a water main.\\n',\n",
       " 'As the 2014 Winter Olympics wind down, it\\'s time to remember that there is something very special about the Olympics -- and it\\'s not pride in the USA or the Americans\\' medal count. \\nFor two weeks, the world comes together and is focused on watching people from different nations represent their country and compete for the gold. The tradition appeals to people of all ages -- most especially, it seems, families. For these few weeks, kids seem less interested in their iPhone and iPad, and parents engage with their family instead of with their emails every night. \\nWhy does watching the Olympics as a family feel like a treat? As we collectively learn about the athletes in our living rooms -- their stories, tragedies, triumphs, and their culture -- we become engaged in the larger world. Our kids\\' minds and worlds expand in front of the screens: they ask questions, they cheer when there is a strong performance, they feel bad when someone \"chokes\" or takes a bad fall, and they learn to be good and fair fans and not critical or judgmental as they witness the world\\'s finest athletes win and lose.\\nThe Olympics can be a wonderfully engaging tool to teach kids life lessons.\\nWhen you tune in tonight, I hope you consider these: \\nDedication  Many Olympians start training when they are in early elementary school, many leaving their families to live in dorms. They become great not only because of exceptional talent, but after years of practice and thousands of hours of training. Dedication is what our kids need to accomplish any goal set before them, or goals set by themselves.\\nPerseverance  Not only do the athletes need to be dedicated, they need to persevere when injured and when they have trouble mastering a new trick, strategy, or style. They do not give up when their coach and the media is critical of them. They do not give up when they are told they may not have what it takes to be among the world\\'s greatest athletes. They do not give up when they start to believe what others are saying. Our children need to learn to persist when they meet an unexpected obstacle because life is full of them.\\nCourage  Olympic athletes devote their lives to their craft. They train for the opportunity to represent their country and compete when everyone is watching and everyone is expecting them to win. When they fall, they have to get back up and continue their performance. They have cameras on them when they receive their undesired score. They are interviewed about their poor performance and asked how they feel about it. And then they go back on the ice or slopes and give their best effort -- for all to watch and judge again. Our children need courage to take chances and pursue their goals.\\nTeamwork  Many of the Olympic sports are team sports. Even the individual sports (speed skating and figure skating for example) still compete to earn an overall team score. It\\'s inspiring to watch athletes cheer for other athletes... and for their larger team, their country. Our children need to learn to be a part of something larger than themselves.\\nSportsmanship  We watch the \"thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.\" We see athletes win and show appreciation for their fellow competitors. We see athletes take hard falls, under-perform, fail to achieve their life long dream and still rise up to celebrate the victories of their countrymen and competitors. Sportsmanship shows a person\\'s character and show our children how to learn to both win and lose with grace.\\nCultural and Economic Diversity  The Olympics gives the global audience a \"reality show\" like no other!

       " 'WASHINGTON -- The fastest-moving legislative train on Capitol Hill is a bill to lift the four-decade ban on exports of American crude oil. But last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced that she\\'d had enough of the lobbying push from the nation\\'s largest oil companies. \\n\"The most obvious effect of lifting the crude oil export ban would be to produce enormous profits for a number of big oil companies,\" Warren said at a Senate Banking Committee hearing. \"And that is a reason by itself to be skeptical of study after study and expert after expert that have been funded by big oil to try to sell this deal. ... Lifting the ban without thoroughly considering and addressing the potential environmental consequences sounds pretty darn reckless.Watch Warren\\'s full comments in the video above.\\nPresident Gerald Ford implemented the oil export ban in 1975 to protect an energy resource with major national security implications. The recent boom in fracking and domestic drilling has flooded the market, driving down crude oil prices and crimping profits for Exxon-Mobil and other big oil producers. Oil companies have financed a host of studies proclaiming that shipping domestic oil abroad will lower gas prices at home, but independent economists have mixed views.\\nThe environmental impact is more straightforward -- allowing companies to export oil from the United States will facilitate more drilling and fracking and result in more greenhouse gas emissions from expanded fossil fuel use. At the hearing, Warren blasted Republicans on the committee for relying on environmental testimony from a climate change denier.\\n\"We\\'ve held a hearing on the export ban in July,\" Warren said. \"But the only witness -- the only witness testifying on the climate effects of this bill was a conservative economist who thinks, quote, \\'No one really knows\\' the extent to which humans are causing climate change.\" \\nWarren has been campaigning against conflicts of interest in economic studies of late. Last week, economist Robert Litan resigned from the Brookings Institution after Warren sent the prestigious think tank a letter highlighting a sloppy study he performed with funding from an investment company. \\n The oil export ban is expected to sail through the House with strong support from the GOP majority, and a bill to lift it has also cleared two Senate committees. There are some exemptions to the ban -- Canada, for instance, can receive American oil shipments -- and President Barack Obama\\'s Commerce Department has been approving additional shipments to other countries.\\n\"The bill in front of us would upend decades of energy policy,\" Warren said at the hearing. \"And if the oil industry\\'s rosy projections turn out to be wrong, the bill has next to nothing in the way of environmental or economic protections. We may need changes in the oil export ban, but any changes we make should be based on independent data and should address legitimate concerns. Big oil may not like that, but we weren\\'t sent here to work for them.\"\\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly claimed the House had already passed an oil export ban.\\n',\n",

       " 'India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a working or “no frills” trip to Washington. It was a chance for him to meet President Donald Trump as they discussed what the White House called “common priorities.”\\nSome observers have highlighted similarities between the two leaders, including their nationalist/populist message. Both emphasize business and jobs but neither believes in free markets. Both benefited from a surge in support from religious voters, though the faiths differ. Finally, critics tagged both as potential strongmen. However, PM Modi appears measurably stronger politically.\\nIndeed, the latter is the far more practiced politician. He led the state government of Gujarat and Bharatiya Janata Party before taking over as premier after the BJP’s overwhelming victory in 2014. The party did well last March in state elections, winning outright in the super-state of Uttar Pradesh. Although the BJP did not win everywhere, it far out-classed the once ruling Congress Party with a campaign that transcended caste politics, embraced Hindu nationalism, and relied on grassroots activism. PM Modi appears well-positioned for a repeat national victory when elections are held in two years.\\nUnder him India has become more active internationally. New Delhi gloried in its role as a member of the “nonaligned bloc” during the Cold War. Now the bipolar world is gone and India is wealthier and better positioned for global leadership. President George W. Bush initiated a significant improvement in U.S.-India relations, hoping to develop New Delhi as a counterweight to China’s growing influence.\\nAlthough India has no desire to be the catspaw of Washington or anyone else, it is a natural rival to the People’s Republic of China. Their relationship remains marred by a territorial dispute that sparked a short war a half century ago. Even before the U.S.-New Delhi rapprochement, India was active economically in Burma when Western sanctions had given the PRC a near monopoly and the Indian navy was patrolling waters in Southeast Asia where local forces were dwarfed by China’s forces.\\nThe Obama administration continued to promote good relations, as should the Trump administration, despite some concerns in New Delhi created by the president’s criticisms of the Paris climate change treaty and hi-tech H-1B visas, which have benefited many Indian professionals. President Trump’s apparent choice for U.S. ambassador to India, Kenneth Juster, currently serving on the National Economic Council, should be a positive influence given his extensive experience with India. There are several areas for fruitful cooperation, including economic. U.S. officials have suggested the possibility of negotiating a free trade agreement. No formal alliance is needed; a friendly, prosperous, and democratic India naturally serves the balance of power.\\nIt perhaps has become an international cliché, but India should follow China down the path of sustained high economic growth. With a growth rate of 7.9 percent in 2015 India has been growing faster than the PRC. Last year the International Monetary Fund forecast continued expansion above seven percent annually in coming years. Many of India’s fundamentals look solid. Inflation remains modest. India’s population is likely to surpass China’s and the McKinsey Global Institute predicted that India’s “consuming class” will triple in size over the coming decade. Entry of more women into the workforce affords India another important growth opportunity. Moreover, India’s “country risk” is below that of China, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. Indeed, New Delhi enjoys a clear though hard to quantify advantage from democracy: Indian politics is messy, but offers a critical pressure valve lacking in the Chinese political system.\\nYet there are worrisome signs that India may fall short of its potential. Some growth fundamentals remain weak. For instance, government spending rather than private investment has been driving the economy. The drop in oil prices also spurred recent growth; no similar stimulus is likely in the near future. Per capita GDP increases have not kept up. Job creation also has disappointed. HDFC Bank warned of a “growing disconnect between economic growth, education, skills and jobs.”\\nA number of companies fear the future. Business confidence, along with sales growth and capacity utilization, are down. In March the Economist reported that “firms are busy cutting back investment as if mired in recession. Bank lending to industry, growth in which once reached 30 percent a year, is shrinking for the first time in over two decades.”\\nEven the information technology sector is suffering. The Modi government had hoped to expand India’s success in information technology, proposing to wire every village as part of the “Digital India” plan. But layoffs have hit the IT sector, which currently accounts for nearly ten percent of India’s GDP. Kris Lakshmikanth, who runs Head Hunters India, said that “For the first time, companies are touching middle management.” The industry, which provides two-thirds of world IT out-sourcing, also faces foreign pressure. A related threat from President Trump is limiting use of H-1B visas, available for more highly skilled workers.\\nThe national government has a debt to GDP ratio of 67 percent, among the highest in Asia; the 2018 deficit will be about 3.2 percent. State debt also has been increasing sharply, up from two percent of GDP in 2012 to about three percent now. Annual state deficits run about 2.5 percent of GDP. The combined national-state deficit is burdensome 5.7 percent of GDP.\\nEarlier this year states began writing off agricultural debts. In Uttar Pradesh the victorious BJP promised to waive $5.6 billion in small farmers’ loans. Farmers across the nation then demanded the same treatment. The likely result is a $40 billion write-off, about two percent of GDP. (The then-ruling Congress party took a similar step in 2008, at a cost of 1.8 percent of GDP.)\\nStill, the most serious barrier to an Indian economic take-off is India’s government, both national and state. Around the world—India’s diaspora numbers some 30 million—ethnic Indians are traders. But not in India. New Delhi and numerous state capitals simply smothered the natural entrepreneurship of the Indian people.\\nCollectivist, dirigiste economics reigned. The state dominated the economy’s commanding heights, imposed confiscatory tax rates, created a “License Raj” to micro-manage private industry, and enforced its dictates through a bureaucracy rated the worst in Asia. Even as the famed “Tigers” of Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and eventually China raced ahead, India languished. As late as 1983 the poverty rate was an astounding 60 percent.\\nMeaningful reform finally came in 1991. Although the changes were sharply limited compared to what needed to be done, they were a dramatic advance over the past. Average incomes doubled within a decade and tens of millions of Indians escaped poverty. But people hoped for so much more while New Delhi again fell behind. For instance, in the 2014 Economic Freedom of the World rating, India had dropped to 112 from 102 the year before. Explained Swaminathan S. Anklesaria Aiyar in a Cato Institute study, “Although many old controls have been abolished, many still continue, and a plethora of new controls have been created.”\\nExpectations were great when PM Modi took over, given his pro-business rhetoric and positive record in Gujarat. And his government has some solid achievements, despite lacking control of the upper house, which allowed the opposition to block some measures. Modi’s administration streamlined the goods and services tax (GST), implemented a new bankruptcy code, eased restrictions on foreign investment, limited spending, eliminated capital and certification requirements barriers for business, accelerated environmental approvals, and improved public administration and infrastructure. Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General of the Confederation of Indian Industry, praised the “impressive agenda of innovative economic reforms and social programs that have positively impacted growth.”\\nHowever, some of the premier’s supporters have been disappointed, given the magnitude of the changes yet needed. For example, Shankar Acharya, a columnist for New Delhi’s Business Standard, worried: “Economic reforms have clearly lost momentum and there is a sense of drift in economic policy.” The Times of India editorialized that “the government hasn’t pressed the pedal hard on reforms” and “implementation of projects” has been slow. The Economist saw a cavalcade of mini-initiatives rather than a serious reform program.\\nDespite BJP rule, the 2017 Index of Economic Freedom rated India at only 143 of 180 countries. In contrast, China stood at 111. Moreover, New Delhi’s rating fell from the year before. India performed particularly poorly on business freedom, financial freedom, government integrity, investment freedom, judicial effectiveness, and labor freedom.\\nPM Modi’s ability to effect change will improve as the BJP makes additional gains in parliament’s upper chamber. However, the premier is more like Donald Trump than Ronald Reagan, to whom he was originally compared, in that he believes in managed rather than free markets. In fact, the BJP has, in the words of the Carnegie Endowment’s Milan Vaishnav, a “nationalist, protectionist wing” with which President Trump would be comfortable. Moreover, despite PM Modi’s dominating role, he “seems stuck in the mindset of a provincial executive: he is more interested in projects than in policies; he is a modernizer, not a reformer,” observed Sebastian Mallaby of the Council on Foreign Relations. The Economist similarly termed the premier “a fine administrator but not much of a reformer.”\\nThe government often has manipulated rather than freed the market. For instance, New Delhi imposed agricultural prices controls and criticized “hoarding,” Officials also have discussed recreating state monopolies in “strategic” economic sectors, Particularly harmful was last November’s currency “reform,” by which 86 percent of the nation’s currency was demonetized without an adequate number of new bills available. The result was chaos for all and ruin for some, particularly small, cash-based businesses. Currency shortages in ATMs persisted until last month. Saurabh Mukherjea of Ambit Capital described demonetization “as the economic equivalent of a heart attack.”\\nPM Modi moderated the political blowback by playing the populist card, arguing that the program was necessary to tame the rich and stop corruption. But whatever the economic justification for moving the economy away from a disproportionate reliance on cash, the government appeared motivated more by the desire to bring the nation’s finances under its control. The botched swap probably accounted at least partly for the lower annualized growth of 6.1 percent during the first quarter of this year, below the rate when PM Modi took office. And the impact could last for some time.\\nThe premier should shift course and use his authority, strengthened by the March elections, to accelerate reforms. Much could be done to liberalize markets, encourage entrepreneurship, ease business creation, and spur employment. For instance, Cornell’s Eswar Prasad of Cornell advocated “reducing labor regulations, unshackling businesses from red tape and bureaucracy, reducing government control of banks and clearing up their bad loans, developing capital markets, revamping the government’s tax and expenditure systems and improving infrastructure.”\\nFor instance, the rules governing business hiring and firing greatly increase costs, discouraging job creation. Employment actually has fallen in these areas, while growth has been limited primarily to uncovered industries. Regulated companies tend to stay small and rely on temporary labor. India hosts only 270 firms with sales above $125 million, compared to 7,680 in China. Nine out of ten jobs come from the informal sector. This system has greatly hindered development of a competitive manufacturing industry, like that in China. India’s abundant human resources are being squandered.\\nGovernment enterprises are used to provide jobs. Even in a good economy financial losses are routine. Firms that make money usually rely on government monopolies or other special privileges. Air India loses more money the more it flies. Overall, parastatals lose billions of dollars a year. They survive only at extraordinary public cost: “soft loans, subsidies, and bail-outs keep them afloat,” observed the Economist.\\nState banks are loaded with bad debts which McKinsey & Co. figures exceed the banks’ total value. Government “services” are a scandal. Said Aiyar, “With almost no exceptions, the delivery of government services in India is pathetic, from the police and judiciary to education and health.” Many teachers in public schools don’t even bother to come to class. Lawsuits can take decades to resolve: the legal system has a backlog of 31.5 million cases.\\nPM Modi also should avoid the temptation to inflame Hindu nationalism to win votes. Religious intolerance and persecution have worsened since his 2014 victory. Vigilantism has been rising, especially against Muslims accused of trafficking in beef. Yet after the BJP’s victory in Uttar Pradesh he appointed as chief minister a Hindu priest once jailed for his violent rhetorical attacks on Muslims. Even if such tactics yield short-term political benefits, they risk not only social conflict but economic harm, discouraging foreign investment and trade which would benefit all Indians.\\nJust as the world spent decades waiting for China to escape Mao Zedong’s communist madness, so, too, has the world spent decades waiting for India to leave behind Jawaharlal Nehru’s socialist nostrums. PM Modi offers competent management and has moved his country closer to economic freedom. But getting the rest of the way requires freeing India’s people from the shackles created by government social and economic engineers. Ethnic Indians have proved their economic prowess around the globe. Now they need the chance to do so at home.\\nIt is good for the prime minister to visit America early during the two leaders’ joint tenure. Although no one knows how two such egos that have climbed the political mountain in their respective nations will get along over the long-term, Narendra Modi is a worthy partner for Donald Trump. Both have succeeded in tough political systems and overcome harsh opposition. And both have a unique opportunity to leave their respective nations, and ultimately the world, transformed. Working together they are more likely to succeed in doing so, and for the better.\\nThis article was first posted to Forbes online.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nNow that Jerusalem has become one of the best selling cookbooks in recent years, it may be time to look at it in context. The recipes are wonderful, the photographs are mouthwatering, the narrative is compelling and democratic. Beyond food, the book has touched something deeper in all of us. Jerusalem, home to more than 60 religious and ethnic communities, is a lodestar for spirituality, sharing and healing, along with a full measure of continuing strife. So beyond the book\\'s virtues of history combined with recipes, unusual ingredients and flavors, it allows us to hold in our hands a gastronomic overlay to the region\\'s millennial conflicts, through a universal experience that connotes peace and above all, pleasure. \\nI had the rare opportunity last year to interview authors Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi, the former is Israeli, the latter Palestinian, when they came to New York on a book tour. We three sat on the bima in a huge Park Slope synagogue, and gazed upon hundreds of fans who came to listen to their stories and then hungered for more. It was clear to all of us assembled there that their Jerusalem penetrated into a realm far deeper than cooking. The cuisine that the authors express speaks to ancient realities and present truths: The kitchen table knows no boundaries; and no wall, however high and long, can ever be so impermeable to prevent the vapors of the collective culinary consciousness waft through. \\nJust this weekend, I had pleasure of a parallel experience.

       " 'Scotch whisky has been around for an awfully long time -- more than 500 years, in fact. By now you\\'d think that every visionary distiller and novelty-minded charlatan would have explored and exploited every possible wrinkle in the whisky-making process. But every now and then a whisky comes along that\\'s produced in a genuinely new way. In fact, Nomad Outland Whisky is so different that it can\\'t even be called Scotch.\\nSo what\\'s the big deal? Nomad is a blended whisky that\\'s been matured in sherry casks -- ho-hum, been there, done that, bought the kilt. But in fact, Nomad Outland Whisky actually is a big deal. You\\'ve never heard of \"Outland\" whisky before, and that\\'s because the folks at Gonzalez Byass (the Spanish company that\\'s new to spirits but famed for its Tio Pepe sherries) are trying to create a whole new whisky category. Yes, it\\'s made from Scottish malt and grain whiskies, 25 single malts and six grains, to be precise, and yes, it\\'s distilled and aged in Scotland. \\n\\nBut here\\'s the twist. Normally, when whiskies are sherry cask-matured, the liquid is moved into barrels that have formerly held sherry -- barrels which have been brought to Scotland from Spain. The big difference with Nomad is that the whisky is brought to Spain from Scotland. That means the sherry casks are still \"fresh,\" not having had the opportunity to dry out in transit, and the whisky ages in the warm, humid climes of Jerez, rather than cold, clammy Scotland. The result is an intensely rich dram that takes sherried whisky to a whole \\'nuther level. Each sip brings to the fore toffee, raisins, marzipan, caramel, almonds and walnuts, dried apricot... a veritable fruitcake in a glass.\\nNomad is blended by the legendary Richard Paterson, master blender for Whyte & Mackay and the master distiller of The Dalmore\\'s stunning line of single malts, in conjunction with Gonzalez Byass\\' master blender of sherries, Antonio Flores. The whiskies, mostly from Speyside and aged 5-8 years, are blended and aged in sherry butts in Scotland. They\\'re then shipped off to Jerez, where they\\'re aged for at least another 12 months in used Pedro Ximinez casks in the cellars of Gonzalez Byass, whose Tio Pepe sherries are among the best known in the world. The final product is bottled at 41.3% alcohol by volume (82.6 proof). Paterson says that proof gives it a robust flavor, but it\\'s smooth enough so it doesn\\'t need water or, heaven forbid, ice (Paterson is a notorious foe of ice in whisky, prone to throwing cubes across a room when rankled).\\nTo add another stamp to Nomad\\'s passport, it was launched in Taiwan, Asia\\'s most influential whisky market and the sixth largest single malt market in the world, despite having a population less than 1/10th the size of the U.S. Taiwanese love sherried whiskies -- Macallan, famous for its sherry cask-matured expressions, is the most popular brand there -- so the flavor profile caters to the national taste buds. However, Taiwan is one of the only places on earth where single malts are more popular than blends; in the rest of the world, more 90% of the Scotch whisky consumed is blended. And ironically, Nomad\\'s very reasonable $35 price tag may work against it to an extent in Asia, where whisky is seen as a luxury item and a status symbol.\\nSo far, however, the response in Taipei has been positive, especially among bartenders, who have been encouraged to play around with it in cocktails, despite Richard Paterson\\'s emphasis on trying it unadulterated. And the price tag reinforces that Nomad is a whisky that\\'s meant to be drunk, not stuck on a shelf and admired. Whisky drinkers in the rest of the world will get to do both when it\\'s released this fall. Will \"Outland whisky\" become a thing? I get the sense this is only the beginning of whisky cross-breeding (Jura\\'s new Brooklyn expression has the idea down, even if the whisky wasn\\'t aged in Williamsburg). But even if there\\'s never another one, Nomad proves the experiment was a success.\\n',\n",

The trade outlet reports that, in order to fit a revamped “Idol” into the schedule, it might take the other show down to one season per year, from two.\\nIt’d also push the network’s number of reality talent-based competitions to four. In addition to “The Voice,” NBC broadcasts “America’s Got Talent” (created by Cowell and fellow “Idol” alum Ken Warwick) and it just ordered a dance competition starring judge Jennifer Lopez titled “World of Dance.” \\n',\n",
       " \"We all overcome. In fact, our innate ability to get over things is so fluent and natural that most of the time we don't even notice it. The other morning, for example, I arrived at my desk and realized it was extremely hot in my office. I became upset that the air conditioning wasn't working. But then the phone rang, and I had emails to write and people to see. Before I knew it, it was 6 p.m., and I became aware that I was perspiring slightly -- oh, right, the air conditioning was broken, wasn't it?\\nYou see, it may be difficult to grasp in the midst of uneasiness, but only when a person interferes with the mind's capacity to regulate to clarity will he or she struggle. In my case, I became distracted by the busyness of my day and, thus, my irritated and bound-up thinking quickly flowed away. If, from my low level of consciousness, I had hunted down the building superintendent or tried to fix the AC myself (my wife is laughing as she reads this), I would have exacerbated my confusion and my day would have most likely turned out unproductive.\\nBut what was it that truly allowed me to overcome my upset thinking about my hot office (after all, distractions only last so long)? Why do some people always seem to handle adversity and get on with life, while others seem to wallow?\\nThe answer has to do with how the human mind functions. The mind is designed to take out old, stale, and churned-over thought and bring in new, fresh, and uncontaminated thought. The degree to which a person understands this determines his or her level of resilience. Those who move gracefully through misfortune recognize that when their minds are racing or bound up, their perceptions are distorted, so if they try to fix things (e.g., small stuff such as the broken air conditioning, a more acute life event such as a tragedy, or even their own thinking), they'll prevent new thought -- and solutions -- from arriving.\\nIn short, people who seem to not sweat the small stuff actually do sweat the small stuff. However, this tendency is usually short-lived because they also understand that fighting a wayward experience will always make matters worse.\\nThe bottom line is that the human mind is an energetic and powerful source of consciousness. It doesn't care if your thoughts are negative, despondent, insecure, judgmental, or obsessive. If you simply stay out of the way when this type of psychological perspective shows up, untarnished and free-flowing thought will eventually emerge. And so will your built-in ability to get over anything that life has in store.\\nActually, it gets better than that: When you allow the self-regulating function of the mind to do its job, you uncover enduring and impactful answers -- and, at the same time, demonstrate to others the might of looking within.\\nFor more by Garret Kramer, click here.\\nFor more on emotional wellness, click here.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Chicago Blackhawks forward Andrew Shaw apologized Wednesday for a homophobic remark he shouted near the end of Game 4 of the NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs Western Conference quarterfinals Tuesday night.\\n“I am sincerely sorry for the insensitive remarks that I made last night while in the penalty box,\" Shaw said. \"When I got home and saw the video, it was evident that what I did was wrong, no matter the circumstances. I apologize to many people, including the gay and lesbian community, the Chicago Blackhawks organization, Blackhawks fans and anyone else I may have offended. I know my words were hurtful and I will learn from my mistake.\"\\nOn Wednesday, the NHL suspended  Shaw for Game 5 on Thursday and fined him $5,000 for the outburst. \\nWe\\'re used to seeing violence in the hockey ring. But the tantrum Shaw threw Tuesday night was much more offensive than the typical brawl. With just over two minutes left in the playoff game between the defending champion Blackhawks and rival St. Louis Blues, Shaw was called for interference -- a penalty that all but secured a win for St. Louis, which at that point led the game 4-3.\\nDespite the fact that the penalty was blatant, Shaw went on to throw a profanity-laced fit that included a homophobic slur. First, as Shaw skated to the penalty box, he flashed his middle fingers twice at a referee.\\nThen, once in the box, his outburst continued. The 24-year-old slammed a water bottle on the ground, banged his stick against the glass and shouted what appeared to be, \"F*** you, you f***ing f****t.\"\\nShaw\\'s actions drew quick attention on social media, including from Chris Hine, who covers the Blackhawks for the Chicago Tribune.\\n“As some of you may know, I\\'m a gay sportswriter -- who covers the #Blackhawks,\" Hine wrote on Twitter. \"I like Andrew Shaw and have a good relationship with him ... But what he said tonight was inexcusable and is one of the reasons why gay athletes everywhere stay closeted and often live lives of torment.\"\\nWhen asked if he used the slur in a post-game interview, Shaw initially told reporters he couldn\\'t remember. \"Emotions were high,\" he said. \"I don’t know what was said. Obviously, I was upset with the call. It was late in the game like that. I wasn’t happy with the call.\"\\nVideo of the outburst, which was blasted across the internet, helped jog Shaw\\'s memory, however, and both he and the Blackhawks organization have since issued statements about the incident. In its own statement, the Blackhawks said it was \"extremely disappointed\" in Shaw\\'s actions.\\n\"His comments do not reflect what we stand for as an organization,\" the organization said. \"We are proud to have an inclusive and respectful environment, and to support various initiatives such as the You Can Play Project and the Chicago Gay Hockey Association. We will use this opportunity to further educate our players and organization moving forward, so that we all may learn from it.\"\\nShaw\\'s obscene outburst comes just two weeks after the Blackhawk\\'s announced its partnership with You Can Play Project, an organization dedicated to ensuring safety and inclusion of LGBT athletes, coaches and fans in sports.\\nIn a post to Twitter, You Can Play said it was aware of the incident and \"will be reaching out to the NHL immediately to assist in an appropriate response.\"\\nIn addition to the suspension and fine, the NHL will require that Shaw attend sensitivity training. \\n\"While Mr. Shaw was apologetic and remorseful for both the offensive comments and the inappropriate gesture directed at the on-ice officials, he must be held accountable for his actions,\" Colin Campbell, the NHL\\'s senior executive vice president of hockey operations, said in a statement. \"The emotion of the moment cannot and will not be a mitigating factor for the conduct that is expected of an NHL player.\"\\nAs USA Today reports, the NHL has never had an openly gay player.\\n',\n",
       " 'Penelope Cruz doesn’t mind getting into a little bit of trouble for a fun cause. \\nThe actress stopped by “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Tuesday to discuss her role as Donatella Versace in FX’s “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.” But Cruz and the talk-show host took a brief break from the chat about the movie for a Spanish lesson. \\nCruz started with a relatively simple phrase that she asked DeGeneres to repeat. Then the Spanish-born star upped the ante with a Spanish phrase she knew would be bleeped out on television. \\n“I’m not suppose to teach you this but ― me cago en la leche,” Cruz said. When DeGeneres asked what it meant before repeating, the actress hesitated. \\n“Now I’m in trouble if I have to explain what it means,” Cruz said with a laugh. “It’s better if you just learn it and trust me.” Sure enough, the words, “We can’t show the translation on TV” appeared on-screen as Cruz spoke. \\nFor those curious what “me cago en la leche” means, HuffPost has you covered. The sentence directly translates to “I shit in the milk,” but it’s a phrase often used to express frustration or anger in a way that means “fuck.” \\nWatch the full Spanish lesson in the clip above. \\n',\n",

       " \"Alright, we need to talk about your pork. How many times have you ordered pork tenderloin, or brought one home to cook and ended up with a dry, bland, depressing meal? We are really sorry to report that it's happened to us on more than one occasion in both scenarios. Never again. Let's all resolve, from here on out, to eat better pork. \\nPork tenderloin, like most other cuts on a pig, can be incredibly delicious, juicy and tender, as the name indicates. So what's getting in the way? Well, fat. Or lack thereof, really. The tenderloin is incredibly lean, which means that it goes from perfectly-cooked to over-cooked in a hot minute. But there are some things you can do to help safeguard against dry, depressing pork tenderloin recipes. (Of course, once you cook a pork tenderloin enough times, you'll know when it's perfectly done no matter how you cook it, but practice makes perfect, so we're giving you some cheat codes.)\\nLard It  Get the Prosciutto Crusted Pork Tenderloin recipe from Food52.\\nLarding the tenderloin just means that you are either wrapping it or stuffing it with something that imparts the fat it needs to stay moist, like prosciutto, bacon, lardo, etc. Look, you're here to read about pork tenderloin, so don't act all surprised that we recommended more pork on your pork.\\nMedallionize It \\nGet the Pork Scallopini with Dill Pesto and Chickpeas recipe from Bev Cooks.\\nBy slicing the tenderloin before you cook it, you'll fraction the cooking time. For scallopini-thick slices, it will only take as long to cook through as it does to get a nice sear on each side.\\nReally, Really, Really Cook It  Get the Slow Cooker Paprika Pork over Parmesan Polenta recipe from Bev Cooks.\\nBy which we mean slow cook it. Braise the hell out of it. Some people will tell you it's sacrilegious to do this to the filet mignon of pork. We say listen to your heart. Unless your heart says to buy a pre-marinated, packaged pork tenderloin. Don't do that. You have no idea how long it's been marinating in that package, and if you marinate a tenderloin for too long, it will be mushy when you cook it.\\nCheck out our other favorite, non-boring ways to eat pork tenderloin in the slideshow below.

       " \"As we celebrate the fifth anniversary of Obama's Race to the Top competition, many of us are contemplating whether or not it was a success. After much reflection, I decided to write an opinion piece, assessing it on its merits. Toward the end of the piece, I will issue a letter grade (A-F) denoting the result of my evaluation.\\nTouted as Obama's education reform magnum opus, Race to the Top aims to sustain successful teachers and principals in school districts across the nation. It is also responsible for the adoption of common K-12 teaching standards. Per the competitive component of this 'race,' states receive points for fulfilling certain criteria, such as performance-based standards for teachers and principals, showing fidelity to nationwide standards, encouraging charter schools, and the like. \\nAt least, this is how it works in theory. Generally speaking, though, the Race to the Top initiative has raised standards for learning and emphasized college and career readiness. Each year, the program gives even more in federal funding to states that prepare plans for reforming their student offerings. \\nThe program has allocated more than $4 billion among 19 states for developing plans to improve learning standards, teacher effectiveness, and struggling schools. The states granted the funds represent 42 percent of all low-income students in the nation, too, making the initiative an effective way to close the achievement gap and equalize funding in areas where schools may struggle based on their geographical location. \\nIt all sounds good in a condensed summary, but upon closer review, Race to the Top has not had the intended impact. Critics of Race to the Top argue that its emphasis on high-stakes testing is untrustworthy - and I am inclined to agree. As the grant period comes to a close, it is clear that reform has fallen short - particularly when it comes to student performance. A few areas that have not lived up to Race to the Top goals include:\\nCollege enrollment. While graduation rates are above target, the number of high school graduates enrolling in college or some other form of post-secondary learning has actually decreased. Proficiency on standardized testing nationwide has not risen as quickly as promised, either. There are exceptions, of course. North Carolina secured $400 million in 2010 to be used to advance public education through technology, teacher training and evaluation, changes in classroom standards, and a focus on low-performing schools. The state still has about 25 million unspent dollars of the grant and is asking to extend the program by one more year. In 2013, the U.S. Department of Education praised N.C.'s progress.\\nUnused vouchers. To attract better teachers, Race to the Top grants are allowed to be used for vouchers created to lure high-performing teachers to low-performing schools. These vouchers have a relative amount of freedom-for-use attached, with vouchers being allowed to pay students loans, tuition, housing, and other options. Unfortunately, many of these vouchers have gone unused by the districts. In 2012, only 35 of 106 schools eligible to get bonuses for improved student performance received the extra $1,500 per teacher. \\nPoverty still too big a player. Many of the states receiving funding were targeted that way because of higher-than-average low-income students, or those living in poverty conditions that impacted their educations. The fact that Race to the Top does not address overemphasis on standardized testing and teacher accountability is a problem, according to people like Elaine Weiss of Broader, Bolder Approach to Education. Weiss' group calls for better focus on poverty and the issues that accompany it, especially in urban classrooms, and believes that without that specialized attention in Race to the Top grants, the true problem of K-12 Americans becoming college graduates will never be addressed. \\nTo be fair, the biggest grant-funded Race to the Top changes are largely unseen - at least so far. They are invisible to the general public. Some things are simply not cut-and-dry, or able to be seen in the short term. Some of the grant money that has been distributed has paid for summer institutes for teachers and principals where they were trained in the new Common Core standards. Technology improvements like building Cloud infrastructures are still in their infancy and have not truly been realized just yet. It is also too soon to see what positive changes recruiting high-quality personnel will have. \\nAlthough it is not the silver bullet that many believed it would be, Race to the Top is definitely a step in the right direction when it comes to education policy reform. Under President Obama's and Secretary Duncan's watch, the U. S. education system is experiencing something that it hasn't experienced in ages -- genuine progress. Although we have many more miles to go, we have to remember that Rome was not built in a day. The issues that continuously plague our public education system took decades to get that way and will probably take several more decades to fix. Again, my opinions are just that, my opinions. \\nSolely on its merits, I will have to give Race to the Top a solid B. Race to the Top is not a failure; it just has not turned out to be the golden child its intentions promised. There is room for improvement, especially when students are still tested using antiquated assessment measures. Although Race to the Top has not lived up to the hype, what President Obama and Secretary Duncan have been able to accomplish in five years is nothing short of amazing. \\nAs the grant period comes to a close, it will be interesting to see if these issues are debugged and if more money is allocated.\\nWhat do you think? Has Race to the Top been a success? What grade would you give it?\\n\"]"
